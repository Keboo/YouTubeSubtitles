[00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h01m47s)

sorry ed my mic muted we will get I was


[00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h01m53s)

gonna say I noticed we've got a couple


[00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h01m54s)

people jumping into the stream though I


[00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h01m58s)

never know how much to trust this viewer


[00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m00s)

count because I know that I know that


[00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m05s)

like I should be counting for at least


[00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:23,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m07s)

two but my count is not equal to that so


[00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:23,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m10s)

it gets a little weird cool


[00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m31s)

sweet


[00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m42s)

okay well I guess this is roughly


[00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m44s)

starting time so I will I will kick this


[00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:53,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m47s)

stream off and get things going hey


[00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m49s)

Xavier so tonight for anybody who's


[00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m53s)

watching my stream previously rather


[00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:00,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m55s)

than doing the material design and zamel


[00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h02m57s)

we have John with us and we're going to


[00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m00s)

be going over and doing some looking at


[00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m02s)

the system command line library so John


[00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m05s)

I am sure you can do it much better


[00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m07s)

justice than I will so if you would like


[00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m09s)

to give an introduction and then you can


[00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m13s)

you can dictate where where we're headed


[00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m15s)

from there


[00:03:51,230 --> 00:04:00,349](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m51s)

hey John hold on one second apparently


[00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:06,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h03m55s)

this guy is not John go ahead real quick


[00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:09,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m00s)

would you in my in my haste to set this


[00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m06s)

up I did not apparently grab your audio


[00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m09s)

source so one second let me let me see


[00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:22,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m12s)

if I can pick you up real quick


[00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:27,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m15s)

monitor because you come through for me


[00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:31,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m22s)

but it is not going back out which is


[00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m27s)

not helpful okay


[00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:48,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m33s)

Thank You Xavier I appreciate that let


[00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m43s)

me see if I can pick you up from


[00:04:51,520 --> 00:05:03,069](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h04m51s)

I said to do it John I may or may not


[00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:06,789](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m00s)

have to call you back because I think I


[00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:11,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m03s)

may end up having to grab it is not


[00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:14,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m06s)

giving me the outputs that I am looking


[00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:24,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m11s)

for let me see if I can just redirect


[00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:24,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m14s)

you to one that is showing up come on


[00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:46,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m38s)

so now I've got you going out John but


[00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:56,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m42s)

now I can't hear you anything how about


[00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:58,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m46s)

now any better Mic Check Mic Check no


[00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m56s)

look okay there we go


[00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:06,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h05m58s)

uh-huh okay very cool sweet we will go


[00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m04s)

we will go this route and if you want to


[00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,599](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m06s)

let me know if you get too much feedback


[00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:12,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m07s)

from him for some reason I cannot pick


[00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m10s)

up my audios the same audio source from


[00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:19,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m12s)

this so mmm but this one will work so


[00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m15s)

John if I can reset you a little bit and


[00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:31,629](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m19s)

have you jump back the beginning that


[00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:33,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m21s)

would be great yeah sure well so yeah so


[00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:36,879](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m31s)

um this is the system command line


[00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m33s)

project this has been going on it has


[00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m36s)

its roots in the dotnet CLI where when I


[00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m39s)

was on the dotnet CLI team we rewrote


[00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m42s)

the internal parser for that for a


[00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,789](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m44s)

number of reasons and then it kind of


[00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m46s)

evolved over time when the dotnet global


[00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,589](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m48s)

tools initiative that kicked off


[00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,039](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m51s)

castling Dollard was looking for a


[00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:59,979](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m53s)

decent way to give people in the


[00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m57s)

community except you know foundation on


[00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:02,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h06m59s)

which to build command-line acts it a


[00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m01s)

lot of parsers out there in the


[00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:08,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m02s)

ecosystem we we sort of identified a few


[00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m06s)

different reasons why we might want to


[00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m08s)

take another stab at this problem has


[00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,399](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m10s)

been solved munch of times in a lot of


[00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,159](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m11s)

it went to going a little bit beyond the


[00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:19,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m15s)

parser itself and into building you know


[00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m18s)

what else do you need for an application


[00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m19s)

when you want testability and you want


[00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m21s)

invocation of some kind of a method you


[00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:28,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m24s)

want eventually what we realize is


[00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m26s)

people would also find it very useful to


[00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,979](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m28s)

have rendering to a console and to be


[00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m31s)

able to do things like animation of


[00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m32s)

output and


[00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:39,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m34s)

and then we started looking at bt100


[00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:41,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m36s)

rendering so it kind of spread out from


[00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m39s)

there and so right now this is on new


[00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m41s)

get at system command line done


[00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m43s)

experimental and that's because the API


[00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m46s)

is still somewhat and flock somewhere


[00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m48s)

trying to figure out what is you know


[00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m53s)

what is it that people might want what


[00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m57s)

should be in the box and what should not


[00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h07m58s)

be in lock so here's that you see it's


[00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m01s)

still got an alpha tag on it and one of


[00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m03s)

the things that I'm working on right now


[00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:09,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m05s)

is a change to some of the core parser


[00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m09s)

to enable better performance and a


[00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m13s)

little bit of a clearer API it's got one


[00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m16s)

of the goals there's a few different


[00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m18s)

issues that I'd like to be able to


[00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m19s)

resolve on github and when I started


[00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m22s)

looking at it more deeply I realized


[00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m24s)

that there was you know but the core


[00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m26s)

parser itself could be made a little bit


[00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m28s)

better it was always a little bit of a


[00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m30s)

you know get it working and then figure


[00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m32s)

out later how to make it make it really


[00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:38,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m34s)

good so we we spread out add a lot of


[00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m36s)

features in other areas and now we're


[00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:45,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m38s)

kind of circling back trying to polish


[00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:48,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m41s)

things out of that so with that in mind


[00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m45s)

I reached out and said hey you want do


[00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m48s)

you want to take a look at this parcel


[00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m50s)

redesign Kevin because kevin has been


[00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m51s)

involved in this project from very early


[00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m52s)

on and so getting some opinions on the


[00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h08m57s)

direction of the API changes of them and


[00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:07,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m00s)

thinking about the new parser something


[00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:14,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m02s)

that I wanted more - is it worth it to


[00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:16,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m07s)

go through some of what kind of a for I


[00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m14s)

guess to get everybody on the same page


[00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m16s)

as far as when it comes to terminology


[00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m18s)

it's easy to say parser but I think kind


[00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m20s)

of breaking down the various constructs


[00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m22s)

from the commands options and arguments


[00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:31,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m25s)

yeah you know the current structure and


[00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:34,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m27s)

the problems we were running into yeah


[00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:39,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m31s)

so when we think about a command-line


[00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m34s)

parser right one way of the most basic


[00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m39s)

thing that the command-line parser is


[00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m40s)

doing is it's taking command line input


[00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:51,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m43s)

so if I say


[00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:52,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m45s)

I'll say dotnet try okay so here we


[00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m51s)

gotten em try which is something we've


[00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m52s)

been working on and it uses the this new


[00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m54s)

system command line and it understands


[00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m57s)

some things about what you know what are


[00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:05,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h09m58s)

the different options and commands that


[00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:08,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m01s)

are available in the application and it


[00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m05s)

has this responsibility to then be able


[00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m08s)

to take in this input and whatever that


[00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m11s)

command want input might be right I


[00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m13s)

might cooked on that try some nonsense


[00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m15s)

right and it needs to say oh yeah that


[00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:22,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m16s)

that doesn't exist right there so


[00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m19s)

there's valid it understands what the


[00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m22s)

meaning of that third token is in the


[00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m24s)

context of this app and says oh it


[00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:33,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m26s)

doesn't work for this particular thing


[00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m29s)

so effectively the the parsing part is


[00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:41,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m33s)

interpreting the raw text of the command


[00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m37s)

line into some kind of you know


[00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:46,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m41s)

something that's meaningful to your


[00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:50,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m42s)

program donna has always had an entry


[00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:57,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m46s)

point for for programs that looks you


[00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:57,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m50s)

know something like something like this


[00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:05,149](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h10m59s)

right those very familiar nope


[00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:16,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m05s)

Visual Studio code is fun like this


[00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:20,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m11s)

right so you have a main method it takes


[00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:25,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m16s)

in an array of strings and and this will


[00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:28,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m20s)

get parsed for you by you know upstream


[00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,759](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m25s)

from from from your managed code exactly


[00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:31,259](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m28s)

they're gonna get parsed into these


[00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m29s)

arguments for you when your entry point


[00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m31s)

your application is called


[00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m32s)

so the most rudimentary command-line


[00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,579](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m35s)

parser is you know you might have


[00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m36s)

expectations that certain tokens appear


[00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:42,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m38s)

at certain positions inside of this


[00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,559](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m40s)

input and you just sort of take for


[00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m42s)

granted that people pass the right input


[00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m43s)

and you parse it you know everything


[00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m45s)

goes wrong if it's wrong something in


[00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m48s)

the wrong position


[00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,679](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m48s)

you know you'd handle all of this


[00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,329](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m50s)

manually so the simplest command-line


[00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m52s)

parsers allow you to just pass those


[00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:58,019](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m54s)

args into something that gives you back


[00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m56s)

something more meaningful maybe


[00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h11m58s)

something with you know specific types


[00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m00s)

maybe some of your arguments are


[00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,899](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m01s)

intended to be integers maybe some of


[00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m02s)

them are intended to be optional some of


[00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m03s)

them are intended to be required maybe


[00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m06s)

you have sub commands if you look at


[00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m08s)

more complicated command line


[00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m09s)

applications you'll find that the the


[00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:16,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m12s)

kinds of input that you might expect can


[00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m15s)

get very complicated you might have a


[00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:19,319](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m16s)

whole list of different sub commands a


[00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:20,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m18s)

whole bunch of different options under


[00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,319](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m19s)

each one of them and all kinds of rules


[00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m20s)

about what kind of input can be passed


[00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:26,129](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m22s)

so we wanted something that would scale


[00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:27,809](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m24s)

from the kind of simple use case and let


[00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:29,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m26s)

people get up and running really quickly


[00:12:27,809 --> 00:12:31,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m27s)

with it up to the more complicated kinds


[00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m29s)

of use cases like the botnet CLI or


[00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m31s)

complicated command line application


[00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m33s)

we'd get and to be able to tackle a


[00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m37s)

bunch of these different kinds of use


[00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m38s)

cases and then kind of the next step


[00:12:40,499 --> 00:12:44,819](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m40s)

from there as we said you know there's a


[00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:46,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m41s)

lot of parts out there what why is why


[00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:49,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m44s)

is it necessary to write a new one


[00:12:46,429 --> 00:12:52,069](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m46s)

the.net CLI was really really complex


[00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:54,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m49s)

piece so it had a lot of requirements


[00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:55,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m52s)

existing and then we want to be able to


[00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,809](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m54s)

add some additional features and make


[00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:01,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m55s)

things easier for people as well one of


[00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:04,319](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h12m57s)

the ones that we show off a lot is it's


[00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:08,629](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m01s)

tab completion right so because our


[00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:08,629](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m04s)

parser configuration understands


[00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m09s)

you know the semantics appear your


[00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m11s)

command line is able to and the


[00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m14s)

structure of a commands and options and


[00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:22,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m16s)

hierarchy today existent it's able to


[00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:25,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m18s)

provide completions for you that's


[00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m22s)

something that is normally really really


[00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m25s)

shell specific people will write a


[00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m27s)

JavaScript that works for bash but not


[00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,649](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m29s)

for PowerShell but for power child not


[00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m31s)

for Zee shell and things like that so we


[00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:37,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m33s)

said if your core parser understands the


[00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m35s)

semantics why not make this something


[00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:40,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m37s)

that works across all shells and I was a


[00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:44,839](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m38s)

really compelling idea for dotnet core


[00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,709](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m40s)

which is cross-platform so that was one


[00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m44s)

of the things that we started thinking


[00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:52,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m45s)

and we you know other things kind of got


[00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:56,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m47s)

added in as we went so maybe you want to


[00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m52s)

find out how the application is going to


[00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,459](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m56s)

interpret your info we have this notion


[00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h13m59s)

here of being able to pass in something


[00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:05,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m01s)

that we call it directive and this is


[00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m04s)

something as well there's a lot of


[00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m05s)

different ones in here that allow you to


[00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,639](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m07s)

have expectations about how you can


[00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m09s)

interact with their command-line


[00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m10s)

application that will cut across


[00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,209](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m13s)

application so uh you know parse lets me


[00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m15s)

understand what how the parser is going


[00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m17s)

to interpret my info there's a debug


[00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,839](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m18s)

directive that allows me to break in in


[00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m20s)

mid parse and attach a debugger before


[00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m23s)

the entry point is called which is a


[00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m25s)

pretty common scenario for developers


[00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m26s)

we're working on this sort of thing


[00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,819](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m28s)

suggestions is driven by this as well so


[00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m30s)

these are some of the features that we


[00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:38,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m31s)

said this would be really useful for a


[00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:40,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m33s)

lot of people so that that's kind of and


[00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:43,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m38s)

then and then model binding came into


[00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,899](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m40s)

this as well so you know we said well


[00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,459](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m43s)

wouldn't it be great if I didn't ever


[00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m44s)

think about the parser call really no


[00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:52,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m46s)

one wants a parser they just really want


[00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:53,839](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m47s)

their application to be invoked so


[00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m52s)

that's when that's where the dragon


[00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m53s)

through concept came from the dragon


[00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m55s)

fruit concept gives you a main entry


[00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m57s)

point that has has strongly typed


[00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h14m59s)

arguments instead of a string arguments


[00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:05,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m00s)

it ultimately this is what you want


[00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:09,199](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m02s)

anyway right you want in some enums and


[00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m05s)

strong type things and there are


[00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m09s)

abstractions here as well that are


[00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m10s)

passed in in a sort of a dependency


[00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m13s)

injection manner which our system


[00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m14s)

command-line concepts like the


[00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m16s)

invocation context is here you can get a


[00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:23,209](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m18s)

parse result object which


[00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,649](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m20s)

gives you this kind of rough abstracts


[00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:30,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m23s)

and tract syntax tree for the parser


[00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:32,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m24s)

input and you can get a console instance


[00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m30s)

pass them to you rather than being


[00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:36,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m32s)

constrained to use the system console


[00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m34s)

singleton which is a big problem for


[00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:42,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m36s)

testing so that's that's kind of a rough


[00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m40s)

overview now getting a rendering side


[00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m42s)

pull up and I think that's a pretty good


[00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m45s)

one there John and for anybody looking


[00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,899](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m47s)

at this like the dragon fruit I've


[00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m49s)

written several kind of small CLI is


[00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:57,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m50s)

using it and it is by far the fastest


[00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m54s)

easiest way to spin up a new console


[00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m57s)

application being able to just public


[00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:05,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h15m59s)

static void main you know file info as


[00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m02s)

my parameter I now have a CLI that has


[00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m05s)

helped support auto completion


[00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:13,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m08s)

everything for passing in a file which


[00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m10s)

which makes it really really easy to


[00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:21,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m13s)

work with yeah we can we can demo this


[00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:27,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m17s)

in like two seconds John can you bring


[00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,329](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m21s)

your console window up a little bit yeah


[00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m27s)

just because these Skype controls at the


[00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:33,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m29s)

bottom occasionally earth every time I


[00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,279](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m31s)

move my mouse onto that window or


[00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:39,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m33s)

floating over where you're taking so


[00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m37s)

there's also uh for anybody who wants to


[00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m39s)

play around with the dragon fruit stuff


[00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m40s)

on the github repo under the wiki


[00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m43s)

there's actually a really nice getting


[00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m45s)

started page in there for the dragon


[00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:52,459](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m48s)

fruit stuff that you can walk through


[00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m49s)

and it'll take you from essentially


[00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:57,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m52s)

exactly what John's showing right here


[00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,589](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m54s)

from dotnet new giving me a new project


[00:16:57,829 --> 00:17:03,399](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h16m57s)

all the way to ok let's let's actually


[00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:03,399](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m00s)

build and run this


[00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:15,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m05s)

so I created just an ordinary console


[00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:16,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m09s)

app which you can see here right but I


[00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m15s)

added dragon fruit to it and so what


[00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m16s)

that lets me do now is I can say well


[00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:29,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m18s)

maybe I want a strongly typed argument


[00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:36,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m23s)

and blah and maybe I give it a default


[00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:40,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m29s)

value all right so now when I run this


[00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:45,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m36s)

by itself I see 5 I don't know what that


[00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:47,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m40s)

5 means so I can say no you know I can


[00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m45s)

gotten that run here it's just I'm


[00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m47s)

passing arguments into my application


[00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m48s)

rather than publishing the application


[00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:56,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m50s)

creating its own XE definitely was


[00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m52s)

dotnet run knows so this is able to tell


[00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m56s)

me some things about my application


[00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m57s)

already you'll see that I've got a


[00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h17m58s)

version given to me for free help just


[00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m01s)

worked for free when hope helped was


[00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m04s)

invoke my entry point wasn't called


[00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:17,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m05s)

thing with this and I can go more


[00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:17,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m10s)

details for help doing this


[00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m29s)

yeah


[00:18:36,379 --> 00:18:41,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m36s)

probably need to set the the debugging


[00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:52,169](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m46s)

yeah because I think by default it


[00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:54,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m48s)

doesn't output the XML is what dragon


[00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:56,069](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m52s)

fruits reading yeah but I thought the


[00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,179](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m54s)

dragon fruit target stuff is not for


[00:18:56,069 --> 00:19:02,849](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h18m56s)

free I think I just might have gotten


[00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:08,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m00s)

XML comment wrong go back to my existing


[00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:14,449](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m02s)

example I'm not sure oh it's got to be


[00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,449](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m08s)

in some summaries terminated on line 19


[00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:24,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m17s)

[Music]


[00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m29s)

so apparently the way that we cut we


[00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m31s)

process the XML that's a bug I guess the


[00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,559](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m34s)

way that we process the XML comments it


[00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m36s)

looks like if the summary is missing we


[00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:43,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m37s)

don't move on to France so that seems


[00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m40s)

just something so yeah this was this was


[00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m43s)

an idea that was based on and you can


[00:19:46,710 --> 00:20:05,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m46s)

see in the appendices the directive


[00:19:49,950 --> 00:20:07,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h19m49s)

right so if I say parse 123 so this is


[00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m05s)

some the idea here with this sort of say


[00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m07s)

people don't want a parser they really


[00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m09s)

just want an invocation so a lot of


[00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m12s)

system command line is doing a dragon


[00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m13s)

food is just a layer on top of that is


[00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m15s)

providing you with a default parser


[00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:30,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m18s)

based on reflection of your entry point


[00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:33,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m19s)

and and analysis of your XML comm so


[00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:39,419](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m30s)

that's that's kind of where things are


[00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:41,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m33s)

today and this is you know if you want


[00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:45,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m39s)

we can get into some of the details of


[00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:47,309](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m41s)

the parser and so yeah I think at least


[00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m45s)

for now that's that's probably a good


[00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:53,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m47s)

overview for for anybody who wants to


[00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m49s)

dive deeper there's been lots of lots of


[00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m53s)

pull requests and lots of people giving


[00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m54s)

feedback on the github so I would say my


[00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m57s)

advice is pull it down especially if


[00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h20m59s)

you've got a new command line app that


[00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:06,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m01s)

you're looking to build or just want to


[00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m03s)

play around with it and give feedback I


[00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m06s)

mean that's been one of the the big


[00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m07s)

things is we can build just about


[00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m09s)

anything but knowing what to build and


[00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,169](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m11s)

what's correct is always difficult


[00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:20,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m14s)

without knowing what the the pain points


[00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:22,049](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m16s)

are and that sort of thing so I tell


[00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m20s)

people pull it down and grab it and let


[00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:27,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m22s)

us know where the where the problems are


[00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m24s)

and what's exciting and what's not so I


[00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:33,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m27s)

guess John then let's let's take a look


[00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,669](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m30s)

at either or some of the issues or if


[00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m33s)

you want to talk to kind of the problems


[00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m35s)

that we've been running into with the


[00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m37s)

parser that's it's driving the refactor


[00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m40s)

um start diving into some of those


[00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m42s)

details because if nothing else that's


[00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m45s)

interesting to me and I'd like to


[00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:52,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m47s)

understand it yeah well and you can you


[00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m50s)

can you know just ask ask the questions


[00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m52s)

that come to mind and they're probably


[00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:02,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m54s)

the right question yeah so I guess my


[00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:04,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h21m57s)

first thought is so what do what are the


[00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m02s)

actual issues that we were looking to


[00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m04s)

solve because I know there was the issue


[00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:18,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m05s)

of single versus multiple arguments on a


[00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:19,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m09s)

on an option that's triggered you know


[00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m18s)

sometimes you push an abstraction to its


[00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m19s)

limits and suddenly something triggers a


[00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:27,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m21s)

change that needs to drive that drives a


[00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:33,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m24s)

whole bunch of other things so this is


[00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:36,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m27s)

the issue here number 310 been open for


[00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m33s)

a while now


[00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:47,899](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m40s)

what this issue is saying is that people


[00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:51,109](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m46s)

would like the ability to have multiple


[00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:58,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m47s)

arguments for a comment now let me


[00:22:51,109 --> 00:23:00,559](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m51s)

explain what that means right now if we


[00:22:58,429 --> 00:23:03,919](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h22m58s)

look at we can we can show this with


[00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:07,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m00s)

dragonfruit I think that's the easiest


[00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,259](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m03s)

way to see it yeah yeah this doesn't get


[00:23:07,609 --> 00:23:10,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m07s)

into you know nut so what's happening is


[00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:13,519](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m09s)

when dragging through when the


[00:23:10,909 --> 00:23:16,249](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m10s)

dragonfruit application starts up there


[00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:20,539](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m13s)

is the real entry point is being emitted


[00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:22,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m16s)

using MMS bill target that goes it finds


[00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:24,289](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m20s)

the entry point that looks like main but


[00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,479](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m22s)

it's strongly typed which is a dragon


[00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:30,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m24s)

fruit special entry point which is your


[00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:32,059](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m26s)

company it does some reflection it finds


[00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m30s)

some things out about the parameters and


[00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:34,729](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m32s)

their types and whether they're optional


[00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:37,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m33s)

and whether they have default values and


[00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:40,759](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m34s)

then it configures the system


[00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:49,129](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m37s)

command-line parser based on those


[00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:50,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m40s)

things now what you can see here and it


[00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:52,039](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m49s)

recognizes a bunch of different possible


[00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,749](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m50s)

tokens for help because you don't know


[00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m52s)

what how to ask for help until you ask


[00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:57,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m53s)

for it so we recognize a lot of


[00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,359](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m55s)

different things for help


[00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m57s)

slash question mark being a common one


[00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h23m59s)

in windows world where the dash H is


[00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:06,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m00s)

more common in POSIX non-windows kind of


[00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m03s)

command lines so this here it's showing


[00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:11,479](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m06s)

that we have some options here right so


[00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m07s)

here's the BLA option that I created we


[00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:13,999](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m11s)

need to put a new version in this off


[00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:16,129](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m12s)

because we've got a little bit better


[00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:18,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m13s)

about this what to call the arguments


[00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:18,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m16s)

and boom


[00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m19s)

this is this is this is a fixed issue


[00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m21s)

bunch of people


[00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m33s)

so we also added argument support here


[00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:48,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m36s)

so what an argument is is I could say


[00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:52,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m39s)

let's just call it string marks save


[00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:54,049](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m48s)

that and we'll look at help again so


[00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:56,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m52s)

here you can see this little argument


[00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:58,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m54s)

section came and so you know here the


[00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m56s)

usage that call the app we can pass in


[00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h24m58s)

some options and we passing arcs so an


[00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m01s)

Arg would be defined like this if I do


[00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m05s)

let's go over here and say beach


[00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:35,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m24s)

the random typing thing is an


[00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:35,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m29s)

oversensitive track that always fun okay


[00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m40s)

all right so the arguments that you know


[00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m42s)

you'll notice and again ignoring dotnet


[00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m44s)

run and - - everything after that is


[00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:51,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m46s)

really the input for passing to lay out


[00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:55,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m49s)

what you wait and see there is that we


[00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:57,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m51s)

didn't need to specify - - arcs or the


[00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m55s)

equivalent - - blah arguments are just


[00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:03,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h25m57s)

they're effectively their positional I


[00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m01s)

think it's something that people have


[00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m03s)

thrown around though not completely


[00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:13,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m05s)

accurate but because unnamed usually


[00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m10s)

precedes something like option yes is it


[00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:20,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m13s)

which isn't quite the same thing yeah


[00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:42,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m16s)

yeah so to get into kind of the syntax


[00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:44,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m20s)

concepts right if we say - we'll put it


[00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m42s)

back


[00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h26m52s)

so


[00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m03s)

just to make this clearer right you can


[00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m08s)

see that by specifying the option we're


[00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:14,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m10s)

saying hey this next token is this named


[00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m12s)

option those other things like their


[00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m14s)

arcs and it's not strictly positional as


[00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:25,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m16s)

you pump it out but I can I could do it


[00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:29,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m18s)

this way as well I can say to this


[00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:31,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m25s)

within the context of one command we


[00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:36,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m29s)

actually allow options and arguments to


[00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:39,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m31s)

be specified in any order so really what


[00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m36s)

the option is doing the - - blah is the


[00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:42,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m39s)

name of the option the option itself has


[00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m41s)

an argument so the way that we


[00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m42s)

structured this in terms of syntax


[00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m43s)

context in the parser is that in this


[00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:53,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m46s)

example here blah was an option 3 was


[00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:56,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m51s)

the argument to that option and 1 & 2


[00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:01,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m53s)

are arguments to the route command which


[00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:06,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h27m56s)

is your execute so does that make time


[00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m01s)

anyone I mean they're there there


[00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:09,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m06s)

haven't been a lot of questions there's


[00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m07s)

been a lot of surprised and happy faces


[00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:17,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m09s)

and excitement ok dragonfruit I guess


[00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:18,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m13s)

which i think is usually normal anyone


[00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m17s)

who's had to go through and try to like


[00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:24,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m18s)

parse that string array themselves knows


[00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m20s)

the the pain and difficulty that comes


[00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m24s)

along with it oh yeah it's one of those


[00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m27s)

problems that everyone has solved a few


[00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m28s)

times that was kind of one of the


[00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m30s)

motivations and and there are other


[00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m32s)

parking libraries out there that have


[00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:41,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m33s)

done a great job at this too so the


[00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:48,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m39s)

thing that's being asked for with the


[00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:51,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m41s)

issue number 310 is the ability to do


[00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:56,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m48s)

something more like this imagine that I


[00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m51s)

wanted to do my app blah


[00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:03,489](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h28m58s)

yeah 23 and then maybe I wanted two


[00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:06,159](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m01s)

different arguments of the great


[00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:07,749](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m03s)

examples is actually is Gibbs got a few


[00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m06s)

of these and I think this is I think


[00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:13,239](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m07s)

this is called out specifically in the


[00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:15,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m09s)

issue right gear from O add options name


[00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:17,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m13s)

and URL


[00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:26,259](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m15s)

all right so what you've already seen


[00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:27,729](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m17s)

here is that the the parts are already


[00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:31,239](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m26s)

understands how to bind things to


[00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:32,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m27s)

specific types right but for but the


[00:29:31,239 --> 00:29:34,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m31s)

arguments for us and they can the


[00:29:32,619 --> 00:29:35,769](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m32s)

argument to be clear can be a type other


[00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:40,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m34s)

than the string but they all have to be


[00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:40,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m35s)

the same type so I can do this


[00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m41s)

and so if I come back here and I say


[00:29:44,979 --> 00:29:51,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m44s)

he's gotten that run and I just pass him


[00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:57,219](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m47s)

two marks like that right I'll get a


[00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:59,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m51s)

parsing error from us I would like a


[00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:02,019](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m57s)

nicer error message for that but but you


[00:29:59,889 --> 00:30:03,369](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h29m59s)

get the idea right it well it didn't


[00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:04,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m02s)

recognize three of the valid argument


[00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:10,179](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m03s)

because it wasn't and we can make an


[00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:11,859](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m04s)

ionizer error message for that so what


[00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:13,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m10s)

what this issue is really asking for is


[00:30:11,859 --> 00:30:20,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m11s)

the ability to have separate arguments


[00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:24,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m13s)

that have different types you know in


[00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:26,649](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m20s)

the example here right give row add


[00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:28,479](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m24s)

various option name would be one


[00:30:26,649 --> 00:30:30,309](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m26s)

argument URL would be another argument


[00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:32,169](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m28s)

and the expectation here would be the


[00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:35,169](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m30s)

using system command line you could make


[00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:36,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m32s)

name string and URL to be constrained


[00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:40,149](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m35s)

for example to be a system data URI and


[00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m36s)

that should just work the problem is


[00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:43,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m40s)

right now that we don't have the concept


[00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:45,219](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m41s)

of multiple arguments for a single


[00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:47,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m43s)

command multiple different types of


[00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:47,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m45s)

arguments


[00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m51s)

so tight I'm not sure I understand the


[00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:58,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m55s)

question you have here so he says off


[00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:03,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m57s)

the top of my head can you provide a


[00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:07,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h30m58s)

type template I'm not sure do you mean a


[00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:08,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m03s)

type converter to basically convert from


[00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m07s)

one of the arguments into a different


[00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m08s)

type is that what you're requesting


[00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m18s)

the I think I think there are yeah and


[00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m25s)

by the way I'm also able to see the


[00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m26s)

comments over here I'm actually almost


[00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m27s)

on the stream on a separate machine so


[00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:34,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m29s)

oh good perfect that makes it easier I


[00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m32s)

was trying to keep track of that for you


[00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m34s)

but I I'll let you then read as well


[00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:41,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m38s)

yeah but I don't quite get the question


[00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m41s)

I think good


[00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:48,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m41s)

let's see now let me show let me show


[00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m46s)

what the API looks like I think I think


[00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:54,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m48s)

there's a lot of great ways to solve the


[00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:57,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m49s)

problem and how how it gets solved at


[00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:58,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m54s)

the API level is sort of a different


[00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m57s)

question than having it solved with a


[00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:04,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h31m58s)

parser level and so right now the parser


[00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:13,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m01s)

itself is not able to understand this


[00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:17,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m04s)

thing so let me show let me show what


[00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:20,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m13s)

the parser looks like that piece of it


[00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:23,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m17s)

the object model for configuring the


[00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m20s)

parser isn't is has a limitation here


[00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:27,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m23s)

which I have this kind of long-running


[00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:29,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m25s)

branch that I've been working on to try


[00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m27s)

to solve this problem actually we merged


[00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:36,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m29s)

the first step before so let's take a


[00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:39,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m32s)

look at take a look at some of the


[00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h32m36s)

parser job


[00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m09s)

all right so here's here's an example of


[00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:16,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m11s)

the API we've created a command we can


[00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m14s)

add an option to the command this also


[00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:23,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m16s)

supports collection initializers which I


[00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:25,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m18s)

think are a little bit easier to read so


[00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:28,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m23s)

we can also do this just just just to be


[00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m25s)

clear I think this is a much cleaner API


[00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m32s)

I'm typing faster than


[00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m36s)

[Applause]


[00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:47,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m44s)

the collection airliner ap I think makes


[00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:51,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m46s)

the object model a little bit clearer so


[00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:54,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m47s)

me just quickly the the collection


[00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:57,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m51s)

initializer so I can add an option like


[00:33:54,100 --> 00:34:00,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m54s)

this the option is the child the command


[00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h33m57s)

I can do the same thing for argument so


[00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:03,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m00s)

we grab this argument we don't need to


[00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:09,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m01s)

pass it constructor I can pass it an


[00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:13,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m03s)

object initializer all right so you can


[00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m09s)

I think with this API


[00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:24,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m19s)

I think okay I'm getting out of myself


[00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:26,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m22s)

this is the API that I want to land on


[00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:29,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m24s)

for arguments and the idea would be that


[00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m26s)

more than one argument would be able to


[00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:34,399](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m29s)

be passed in at least two a command I


[00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:36,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m31s)

think actually that's like yeah this


[00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,109](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m34s)

works for coming okay so this is a


[00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m36s)

commander all right


[00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:43,009](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m39s)

options are not allowed to have multiple


[00:34:41,029 --> 00:34:45,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m41s)

arguments but commands are so that's a


[00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:47,299](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m43s)

recent change to the API so if this


[00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m45s)

piece of it makes make sense of them and


[00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:53,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m47s)

the argument can have a type


[00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:55,879](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m49s)

so this API here would then allow you to


[00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m53s)

you know pile up your options and


[00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m55s)

arguments next to each other the command


[00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:01,759](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m58s)

could specify multiple arguments and


[00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h34m59s)

this feels like a fairly natural way to


[00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:07,279](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m01s)

build up the hierarchy of command and


[00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:12,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m03s)

option market I think it's better than


[00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:19,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m07s)

than it was the problem right now is


[00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:21,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m12s)

that this doesn't really work but


[00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,579](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m19s)

notionally this is kind of what we're


[00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m21s)

talking about right so for this for the


[00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:29,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m22s)

good example we're looking at but you


[00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:33,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m24s)

might have an argument called I mean


[00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:33,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m29s)

jalisa turn alright so this would be


[00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:41,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m35s)

get aggro mode might look like that and


[00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:53,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m37s)

you have another argument you forget Oh


[00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:59,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m41s)

Perry and that would be kind of what the


[00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:59,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h35m53s)

remote command it would be nothing


[00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m01s)

[Music]


[00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m17s)

[Music]


[00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:35,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m26s)

[Music]


[00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:42,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m38s)

there's something that kicks on in the


[00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m41s)

background there every so often it's


[00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:47,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m42s)

like I'm getting a bunch of background


[00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:50,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m44s)

static and noise from you ever so often


[00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m47s)

mmm you know my fam is running pretty


[00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m50s)

hard right now I wonder if that's what


[00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m52s)

it is


[00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:57,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m52s)

there could be a carry on it it's not a


[00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:03,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m55s)

big deal I can still usually make out


[00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:05,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h36m57s)

what you're saying okay so so that's


[00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:15,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m03s)

kind of that's kind of an API we're


[00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:16,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m05s)

aiming at right there and I'll just jump


[00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:18,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m15s)

in here too so it's worth pointing out


[00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m16s)

for people the API that that we're


[00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m18s)

looking at here this is the the core API


[00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:26,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m21s)

that's in the system command-line


[00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m23s)

library when you look at like a lot of


[00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:29,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m26s)

other of the existing libraries out


[00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m27s)

there there there's ones where you


[00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m29s)

specify your options and arguments with


[00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:35,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m31s)

attributes or maybe you build up objects


[00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,849](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m33s)

or various other types of things we've


[00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:43,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m35s)

tried to keep this library as agnostic


[00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:48,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m39s)

of those individual preferences as it


[00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m43s)

were just so that people can build those


[00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m48s)

on top of this so this this core API


[00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m50s)

aims to provide all of the functionality


[00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m52s)

that would support say somebody building


[00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:01,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m54s)

an attribute based model or a class


[00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:03,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h37m57s)

based model and it doesn't we don't want


[00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:06,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m01s)

to block any of those options or take a


[00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m03s)

hard stance on any of them and dragon


[00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m06s)

fruits just one example where we feel


[00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m08s)

that a nice easy interaction model is


[00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m11s)

strongly type your main method and be


[00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m13s)

done but there are some limitations that


[00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m15s)

come with that where some other app


[00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:23,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m17s)

model might be more useful or somebody


[00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m21s)

might feel a little bit more at home


[00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m23s)

with it so be aware that if you hear


[00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m25s)

kind of that terms thrown around an app


[00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m26s)

model that's usually what we're


[00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:32,829](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m28s)

referring to is something built on top


[00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:35,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m29s)

of this core API that puts a prettier


[00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:36,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m32s)

face or interaction API for somebody to


[00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m35s)

work with


[00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m36s)

which I think that may have been what


[00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m38s)

you were referring to a little bit


[00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m40s)

earlier tied as far as how to go through


[00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:45,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m41s)

and interact with it which is why


[00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m43s)

there's kind of those two pieces of


[00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m45s)

first kind of handling this multiple


[00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:54,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m47s)

argument situation in the core API and


[00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:56,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m50s)

then exposing that further down wherever


[00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m54s)

somebody needs to use it


[00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h38m57s)

yeah


[00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m01s)

so you can see a little bit of the a


[00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m04s)

little bit of the core API here is in


[00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:11,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m06s)

this test for example we're parsing


[00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m08s)

Simon but which the input is coming here


[00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m11s)

from that from these data attributes in


[00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:19,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m15s)

the action in Syria so we parse the


[00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:23,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m18s)

input and this is just showing that


[00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:25,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m19s)

different delimiter in equals or a colon


[00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m23s)

can be used to deliver the argument from


[00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m25s)

the option and the parser understand


[00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m27s)

that this is an argument even though it


[00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m28s)

starts with a dash which you might


[00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m31s)

mistake that for adoption but this is a


[00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m33s)

showing that the parts are going to do


[00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:40,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m34s)

that so that I can get the value for


[00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m36s)

option X and that value should be Y and


[00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:47,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m41s)

so I actually did write some tests for


[00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m44s)

number 310 I think I have them and so we


[00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:51,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m47s)

can see what that looks like right so


[00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m49s)

here's some of the multiplier in tasks


[00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:55,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m51s)

there right now they're scary because I


[00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:58,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m53s)

realized that there were limitations in


[00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m55s)

the core parser that we're gonna prevent


[00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h39m58s)

me from getting this thing to pass we


[00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:04,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m00s)

made some some changes so we said you


[00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m02s)

know the command result I should be able


[00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:11,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m04s)

to settle on the one so here's a several


[00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:13,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m07s)

argument I have a narrative 3/3 which


[00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:15,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m11s)

means three tokens will be parsed into


[00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m13s)

that argument no more no less a minimum


[00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:19,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m15s)

of three a maximum string and there's


[00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m17s)

this other argument which is the one


[00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:22,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m19s)

argument which has zero or more rights


[00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m21s)

like saying you know these should be


[00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m22s)

part of the several one two and three


[00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:33,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m24s)

and four should be part of the second


[00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:36,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m27s)

argument which is called one tested not


[00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m33s)

not too unclear now the test makes sense


[00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:40,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m36s)

and you said this is part of what's


[00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m38s)

still the work-in-progress while you


[00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:46,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m40s)

have it being skipped right now yeah yep


[00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m43s)

what I the first kind of turn of crank


[00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m46s)

on this was to make the API able to


[00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m48s)

handle this


[00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:52,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m49s)

so you could say get argument value or


[00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m51s)

default and most people won't have to


[00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m52s)

interact with this because the model


[00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:57,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m53s)

minder will do it for you you'll have a


[00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m55s)

some method that you say hey please call


[00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:59,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m57s)

this method


[00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m57s)

kind of like a controller method an ASBO


[00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:05,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h40m59s)

that the parser and model binder will


[00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m02s)

you know figure out how to satisfy them


[00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m05s)

the parameters of that method and you


[00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m07s)

shouldn't have to think about this too


[00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m08s)

much but the if you do want to interact


[00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:15,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m10s)

directly with the parse result


[00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m12s)

then you can pull values out of it in


[00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m15s)

this way and so what this is showing the


[00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:24,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m17s)

change that was made to show that we


[00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:25,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m20s)

have this argument here to say which of


[00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:29,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m24s)

the command arguments do you want


[00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m25s)

because there's potentially multiple so


[00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:34,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m29s)

that's that's one of the changes there


[00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m31s)

so that you know the API what you can


[00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m34s)

see here is that the API for both


[00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:43,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m36s)

configuring the parser and for pulling


[00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:46,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m39s)

values out of the parse result it's


[00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:48,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m43s)

working right I mean it's the API a


[00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:51,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m46s)

shape has been changed to satisfy that


[00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:57,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m48s)

requirement but the core parser doesn't


[00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:59,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m51s)

work yet so that's kind of the the next


[00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m57s)

step so I sort of put these lips set of


[00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h41m59s)

tests on hold and went back to the core


[00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m02s)

parser and said what does this thing


[00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m03s)

need to do differently for this to look


[00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:11,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m05s)

and that's that's when I opened


[00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:14,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m07s)

Pandora's box makes sense what was the


[00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m11s)

what was the rationale for why we didn't


[00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:18,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m14s)

need multiple arguments on option was


[00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:21,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m16s)

that just something we omitted for now


[00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:27,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m18s)

because it it was currently not a use


[00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:30,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m21s)

case for it or or my own we could open


[00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:33,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m27s)

up another can of worms well no we


[00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:36,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m30s)

couldn't we couldn't find a use case


[00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:40,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m33s)

there wasn't an example that we we knew


[00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:45,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m36s)

it so Tom DeSanto opened issue number


[00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m40s)

310 and he the long-standing contributor


[00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m45s)

as well


[00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m46s)

in the.net CLI we hashed it out and kind


[00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m49s)

of thought about how this would work


[00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m50s)

you know this arity thing here would


[00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m53s)

need to work in this way because these


[00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m55s)

are effectively yep you say in this case


[00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:00,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m56s)

right I'm passing in four arguments they


[00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:02,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h42m58s)

could be of different types maybe I want


[00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m00s)

some of string so in so there needs to


[00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:06,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m02s)

be a certain amount of structure and the


[00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m03s)

positionality is important and we went


[00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:12,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m06s)

and looked for examples of how this kind


[00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:14,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m08s)

of thing used in other command-line apps


[00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m12s)

and in every single case that we were


[00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:19,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m14s)

going to find this only applied to


[00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m16s)

commands and not


[00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:29,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m21s)

okay so that's the main reason why we


[00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:31,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m25s)

need it until we need it there were a


[00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m29s)

few other things as well that we said


[00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m31s)

you know there are a few other things


[00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:36,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m32s)

that were on our minds as well as we


[00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m35s)

started thinking about this refactor


[00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:46,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m36s)

another one was this is one so go back


[00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:50,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m41s)

to take a look for a moment at another


[00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:52,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m46s)

limitation that we hit that is also kind


[00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m50s)

of part of the motivation for this


[00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:58,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m52s)

that's changed in core Mars and there's


[00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m55s)

end of it but there's a first motivation


[00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m58s)

that actually creates all of these which


[00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:04,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h43m59s)

is that the core parser was never any


[00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m00s)

efficient because I wanted to say so we


[00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m04s)

always knew we want to go back and do


[00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:17,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m06s)

some refactoring for performance so


[00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:20,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m10s)

dotnet try it has the directory argument


[00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m17s)

that's hanging out here and it's a


[00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m20s)

little bit weirdly positioned so dotnet


[00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:33,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m22s)

try lets me do them if I go to let's go


[00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:37,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m25s)

to go to the dotnet try the Hawks get


[00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:42,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m33s)

started right and so I can do this I can


[00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:45,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m37s)

say actually somewhere other than that


[00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:49,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m42s)

directory I can I can do this I can dot


[00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:50,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m45s)

that try a directory and this is this


[00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:51,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m49s)

dürer


[00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m50s)

argument saying hey what do you want to


[00:44:51,930 --> 00:45:03,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m51s)

run this thing against and I gotten that


[00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:06,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h44m55s)

try Doc's getting started and it'll open


[00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m03s)

up dot now try in that directory so you


[00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:14,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m06s)

can see here this is where I wanted to


[00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:18,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m08s)

want to dotnet try it wrong right with


[00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:20,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m14s)

another command here which in order so


[00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m18s)

what what China is doing is it lets me


[00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m20s)

write mock markdown files that contain


[00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m22s)

documentation and it makes the


[00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m23s)

documentation interactive and it sort of


[00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m26s)

stitches together text and code in a way


[00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m28s)

where the code can be wrong right in the


[00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m30s)

browser


[00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m33s)

one of the things that we said would be


[00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m36s)

valuable here is that if you're writing


[00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m37s)

documentation you probably want to put


[00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m38s)

it under test in your in your CI


[00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:49,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m41s)

pipeline so your documentation doesn't


[00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:49,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h45m43s)

break so we have this other code


[00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:06,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m00s)

and something's broken there so this


[00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:09,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m03s)

would let me say you know I broke my


[00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m06s)

dock don't work or whatever it might be


[00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m09s)

now the unfortunate thing and it's


[00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m11s)

another limitation of specifically my


[00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:19,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m13s)

parser at this stage is that if I do not


[00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:22,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m16s)

not try help I see this dare option here


[00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:30,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m19s)

it's this argument right that's about a


[00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:34,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m22s)

root directory but this gets awkward and


[00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m30s)

this this bug is like fingers on finger


[00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m34s)

nails on chalkboard to me but there's no


[00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m36s)

straightforward way to fix it because we


[00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m39s)

don't have the ability to say this


[00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:47,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m42s)

Durer argument applies at all levels of


[00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:51,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m45s)

the command hierarchy right now we need


[00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h46m47s)

to redefine at each level


[00:47:01,049 --> 00:47:06,959](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m01s)

yeah and semantically they're actually


[00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:09,209](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m02s)

two different arguments you so yeah this


[00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:11,729](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m06s)

is one that we didn't get this fixed


[00:47:09,209 --> 00:47:13,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m09s)

before our preview released but it with


[00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:15,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m11s)

another motivation for making the parser


[00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:17,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m13s)

a little bit more sophisticated at the


[00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:17,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m15s)

core


[00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m21s)

and the idea here probably from an API


[00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m24s)

perspective is that we would be able to


[00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:30,109](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m26s)

attach the same argument object at


[00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:31,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m27s)

multiple places in that hierarchy note


[00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:33,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m30s)

was showing the courses with a


[00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m31s)

connection collection initializer you


[00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:37,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m33s)

able to create an option or an argument


[00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:40,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m34s)

and actually add it to multiple


[00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:42,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m37s)

different commitments and that would


[00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m40s)

tell you this is valid in all of these


[00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m42s)

different positions that's yeah that's


[00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m44s)

an idea


[00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:03,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m53s)

so how do you go about a refactor like


[00:47:55,840 --> 00:48:04,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h47m55s)

that hmm sorry is that sari tight I've


[00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m03s)

been trying to avoid feedback so I've


[00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m04s)

been muting and unmuting my mic so I


[00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:16,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m06s)

assume it's probably better now I think


[00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:16,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m09s)

I miss clicked on my mute button cool


[00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:24,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m17s)

yes so then where does that mean that


[00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:27,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m20s)

you are at in this long I guess that's


[00:48:24,370 --> 00:48:29,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m24s)

my next question is where is the where


[00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:32,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m27s)

is the state of your branch and where is


[00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m29s)

it needing to then progress as you also


[00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:37,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m32s)

mentioned because I know there's another


[00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m33s)

outstanding github issue for this either


[00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:42,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m37s)

cloning of of objects like this argument


[00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:47,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m40s)

or just being able to apply it at


[00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:52,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m42s)

multiple levels yeah which i think is


[00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:52,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m47s)

similar but not quite related to this


[00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:57,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m52s)

it's similar and I'm what I'm hoping is


[00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:05,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m55s)

that we unblocked a few different issues


[00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:09,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h48m57s)

like that with this change I can show


[00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:12,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m05s)

you how we approached it how the


[00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:18,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m09s)

refactor is going so far and and sort of


[00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:20,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m12s)

the approach that we're taking and you


[00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:23,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m18s)

can see here I'm on I'm on the branch


[00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:28,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m20s)

that has this in progress


[00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m23s)

so here's type conversion test v2


[00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:37,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m32s)

one of the things that I wanted to be


[00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m34s)

able to do was to refactor without ever


[00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m37s)

breaking any of the existing


[00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:44,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m39s)

functionality right so a refactor in the


[00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:46,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m41s)

real purist sense of the term incentives


[00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:55,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m44s)

I'm restructuring code without changing


[00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:56,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m46s)

behavior so here's here's a test and if


[00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m55s)

you if you look at that and crunch


[00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:02,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m56s)

glyphs here you'll see that the test is


[00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:05,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h49m58s)

it's both passing and failing this is


[00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m02s)

this is not a Schrodinger's cat thing


[00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:14,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m07s)

there are actually two versions of this


[00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:16,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m09s)

test but it's the same test and so


[00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:19,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m14s)

there's a lot two versions of the test


[00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:24,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m16s)

is this like multiple target framework


[00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:26,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m19s)

type deal or no so I pinned this so that


[00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:29,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m24s)

you can see the passing version and the


[00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:33,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m26s)

family version the unpin DS for clarity


[00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:37,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m29s)

okay so the pinned tests here these are


[00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:40,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m33s)

the same exact test method right one of


[00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:42,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m37s)

them is declared this is just the type


[00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m40s)

conversion tests okay with class called


[00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m42s)

type conversion tests and then if I


[00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:51,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m45s)

scroll way down to the bottom of this


[00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:53,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m46s)

test class I've added this little this


[00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:58,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m51s)

little class here called v2 which


[00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:00,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m53s)

inherits type conversion does but it


[00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h50m58s)

flips this flag that I've added now this


[00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m00s)

flag is just a shim this is just a way


[00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:06,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m01s)

to to diverge between two different


[00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:11,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m03s)

behaviors so I can drive two different


[00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:14,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m06s)

versions of the code with the exact same


[00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:19,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m11s)

tests so make some yeah that's very


[00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:19,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m14s)

clever ID and consider doing that before


[00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:27,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m19s)

so what so let's take a look at what


[00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:28,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m24s)

this thing does now okay so so basically


[00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:30,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m27s)

this ends you know I've got this test


[00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m28s)

here and I just called it v2 because it


[00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m30s)

reads kind of you know fairly


[00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m32s)

intuitively in the test output so that


[00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:40,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m34s)

type of converting test like converting


[00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:42,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m36s)

tasks v2 okay and every time I add a


[00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m40s)

class like this we'll see a whole bunch


[00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m42s)

of tests now being run against both


[00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m45s)

versions


[00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:49,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m45s)

the parser and I know immediately if I


[00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:51,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m47s)

broke the old version during refactoring


[00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:57,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m49s)

and I can burn down the failing tests on


[00:51:51,570 --> 00:52:00,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m51s)

the Newburgh so just as an example of


[00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:03,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h51m57s)

how I'm doing that I'm just going to


[00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:05,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m00s)

copy this guy and let's go looking for


[00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m03s)

another test class and I started out


[00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:10,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m05s)

with you know we look at the ones that


[00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m07s)

I've done so far it's just these right I


[00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m10s)

started with directive tests that was


[00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m12s)

pretty straightforward one parser tests


[00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:18,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m14s)

was it more complicated parsing


[00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m16s)

validation tests not too bad


[00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m18s)

type conversions and model binding we're


[00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m20s)

starting to get into the into gnarlier


[00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:27,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m22s)

territory let's just just for


[00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:32,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m24s)

entertainment purposes let's go to the


[00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:33,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m27s)

model miner does the model binder here


[00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:36,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m32s)

very much like the model binder and


[00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:38,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m33s)

asp.net system command-line lets you


[00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:44,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m36s)

bind complex objects so I can do things


[00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:46,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m38s)

like you know I can create the class and


[00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m44s)

bind options and arguments to the


[00:52:46,650 --> 00:52:53,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m46s)

properties of that class model binding


[00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m49s)

command handler task actually right so I


[00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m53s)

can I can create an instance of this


[00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m55s)

class and see that the instance of the


[00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h52m56s)

class is being bound


[00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:07,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m02s)

right it's a console out yeah these are


[00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:09,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m06s)

leadership basically what I'm doing with


[00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,989](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m07s)

each of these tests these are kind of


[00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:14,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m09s)

hard to read actually they're a little


[00:53:09,989 --> 00:53:17,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m09s)

bit they're a little bit inception II um


[00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:19,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m14s)

the model minor talks might be clear


[00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,939](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m17s)

right in the steps I'm creating a class


[00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m19s)

called the command I have a class of the


[00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:29,039](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m20s)

center I'm touching up the value in that


[00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m25s)

Center the value of that property is


[00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,979](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m29s)

being set correctly all right so it's


[00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:36,809](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m30s)

not just primitive it's not just


[00:53:31,979 --> 00:53:39,059](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m31s)

instance string it can be complex


[00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:41,059](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m36s)

objects will pass parameters into the


[00:53:39,059 --> 00:53:44,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m39s)

Constructors into the setters thing with


[00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:48,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m41s)

okay let's jump to the fun part here I


[00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,989](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m44s)

want to paste in this class I don't know


[00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:57,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m48s)

if I need this constructor but we're


[00:53:51,989 --> 00:54:00,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m51s)

going to inherit model mine to test it


[00:53:57,509 --> 00:54:00,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h53m57s)

compiles


[00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:17,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m04s)

Wow I was not expecting that okay so


[00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:23,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m08s)

what happened I'm going here and Tim


[00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:26,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m17s)

this 10 model binder test app in model


[00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m23s)

binder tests me too


[00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m27s)

all right so now you can see model


[00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m29s)

buying the tests and model binder test


[00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m30s)

to me - I have to copy - the tests ones


[00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m32s)

being running up the old parser ones


[00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:40,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m34s)

being run against a new parser and they


[00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:46,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m35s)

both all pass whoa that's kind of cool


[00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:48,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m40s)

that's remarkably impressive yeah I'm


[00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m46s)

hoping that the implication there is


[00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:57,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m48s)

that the parser tests hit most of the


[00:54:53,730 --> 00:55:00,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m53s)

hard parts but I'm not sure that we're


[00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:03,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h54m57s)

done yet in fact I'm very I'm very


[00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:08,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m00s)

surprised at that work but that's those


[00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:09,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m03s)

half-ass it but the model binder is at a


[00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m08s)

higher level as well so if the core


[00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m09s)

parser is working correctly then all the


[00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:16,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m11s)

stuff that builds on top of it like


[00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m12s)

model binding should should work


[00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m19s)

we can try not open a few or we can


[00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m22s)

start looking at the design of the


[00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m23s)

parser club


[00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:30,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m24s)

well whatever what wasn't written well I


[00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m28s)

was gonna say the design of the parser


[00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:34,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m30s)

itself I guess is what's interesting to


[00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m32s)

me unless anyone else wants to throw out


[00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m34s)

some options I don't know how long you


[00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:39,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m36s)

wanted to run tonight John I know you


[00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:41,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m38s)

had initially said maybe about an hour


[00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m39s)

and I know we're coming up to that so I


[00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:47,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m41s)

I don't know how much time you have to


[00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m43s)

dive into the parser design or not I can


[00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:50,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m47s)

take a little bit more time this is the


[00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:51,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m48s)

last code related thing I was planning


[00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:56,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m50s)

on doing today and I've already eaten


[00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:58,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m51s)

dinner so that's up to you I'm happy to


[00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m56s)

go on yeah I mean I'd love to take a


[00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:03,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h55m58s)

look at that that parser design and


[00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m00s)

where it's at okay get a better


[00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m03s)

understanding of it


[00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m04s)

sure


[00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:14,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m08s)

so yeah this is this is an interesting


[00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m11s)

sort of design and refactoring problem


[00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:21,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m14s)

but I'm gonna look first at the old


[00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:22,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m16s)

parser let's start with them let's start


[00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:24,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m21s)

with muse


[00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m22s)

neo parcel so there's a static method


[00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:27,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m24s)

that I added to the command line


[00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:31,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m24s)

configuration class and if we go and


[00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:38,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m27s)

shift f12 on this you can find a bunch


[00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:40,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m31s)

of uses of it here's the main one this


[00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:42,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m38s)

is this is the shim that when when the


[00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:47,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m40s)

test says use new parser true or false


[00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:50,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m42s)

right this is where it diverges so this


[00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:52,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m47s)

is this is the meat of the old parser


[00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:56,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m50s)

and this is where we diverge and go into


[00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:56,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m52s)

the new port there's other places as


[00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:02,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m56s)

well


[00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:03,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h56m56s)

so there's another important one so yeah


[00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m02s)

this is you know this is where you get


[00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m03s)

the arguments effectively that get


[00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:09,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m04s)

passed into main and your normal entry


[00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:12,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m06s)

point and we create a command-line


[00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m09s)

parser to parse the arguments raw input


[00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:17,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m12s)

is worth talking about maybe another


[00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:20,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m13s)

time and we get back this partial result


[00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:22,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m17s)

object which is we've been calling it


[00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:25,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m20s)

we've been calling this an AST and has


[00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:29,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m22s)

abstract syntax tree right it's kind of


[00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:32,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m25s)

like one but it's not really in the


[00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:39,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m29s)

purest sense at all but what this thing


[00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:41,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m32s)

represents is is it has structure right


[00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m39s)

it has a bunch of information about the


[00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:46,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m41s)

parser let the parse result right it has


[00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m44s)

the directives if that token these


[00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:48,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m46s)

tokens are just you know what are the


[00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:52,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m47s)

strings that we actually figured out are


[00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:54,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m48s)

inside of their parsers typically have a


[00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m52s)

tokenization step which categorizes the


[00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:59,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m54s)

strings and semantically so the parts


[00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:01,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m58s)

are dealing with semantics and not with


[00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:05,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h57m59s)

strings that stuff the old parts are did


[00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:07,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m01s)

that you know more or less correctly we


[00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m05s)

have this unmatched tokens parse token


[00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m07s)

so just tell me a bunch of stuff about


[00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:12,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m09s)

what the parts are thought about what


[00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:13,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m10s)

was going on in there and the real goal


[00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m12s)

is we create this root command result


[00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:17,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m13s)

and there's also a command also you


[00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:19,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m15s)

sub-command know these things are


[00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m17s)

telling you here's here's what we found


[00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:23,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m19s)

out about this commander them that has


[00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:25,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m20s)

options hanging off of it or option


[00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m23s)

result objects hanging off of it and the


[00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:30,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m25s)

option results and command results have


[00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:32,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m26s)

argument resulting so those things allow


[00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:34,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m30s)

you to go and interrogate for strongly


[00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m32s)

typed values and find out whether an


[00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m34s)

option is applied or not find out


[00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:40,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m36s)

whether an option was implicit or not be


[00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:42,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m37s)

given a default value all kind of thing


[00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:46,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m40s)

so those result objects the command


[00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:49,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m42s)

results option results an argument


[00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:50,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m46s)

results they all inherit symbol result


[00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m49s)

so you can see what the site looks like


[00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:56,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m50s)

so this is kind of taking two different


[00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m53s)

concepts and sticking them together in a


[00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m56s)

way that made things a little less


[00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m57s)

flexible no no's ideal and those


[00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:05,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h58m59s)

concepts are one is kind of the abstract


[00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:07,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m02s)

syntax tree concept right and the other


[00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:10,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m05s)

one is kind of related to model bonding


[00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m07s)

so it's like an abstract syntax tree


[00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:15,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m10s)

that knows how to convert things into


[00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m12s)

strong types like you know the types


[00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:19,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m15s)

that you configure the parser have to


[00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:22,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m16s)

ask for giving in skinny dates getting


[00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m19s)

file info whatever it might be


[00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:30,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m23s)

so I started scratching my head and I


[00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:31,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m27s)

sit next to the rod one team and there's


[00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m30s)

lots of people who know more about


[00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m31s)

parsers than I ever will


[00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:37,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m32s)

nearby and I started scratching my head


[00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:42,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m35s)

about this idea of writing a more


[00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m37s)

correct parser and what does that look


[00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m42s)

like


[00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m42s)

so let's look at the object model for


[00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:49,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m44s)

the more correct parser and they're


[00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m45s)

going to ask me questions about it all


[00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:54,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m49s)

right in here I added this parsing


[00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m52s)

namespace and it's got a whole bunch of


[00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:56,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=00h59m54s)

types in it


[01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m06s)

yeah


[01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:19,099](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m11s)

oh okay there's a lot of new stuff in


[01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:20,089](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m14s)

there yeah and there it looks like a lot


[01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:27,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m19s)

of new stuff that it's actually


[01:00:20,089 --> 01:00:27,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m20s)

extraordinarily simple here's an example


[01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:37,950](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m30s)

yes they're just data structures really


[01:00:34,849 --> 01:00:41,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m34s)

so whereas the old command result class


[01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:45,569](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m37s)

knows all kinds of things about both


[01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:47,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m41s)

about the raw tokens and you know it


[01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:49,019](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m45s)

knows things about the parsed input but


[01:00:47,549 --> 01:00:51,509](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m47s)

it also knows things about the expected


[01:00:49,019 --> 01:00:52,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m49s)

output of that parsed input like how


[01:00:51,509 --> 01:00:55,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m51s)

we're going to convert it into other


[01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:57,839](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m52s)

thing so those those classes are quite


[01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:04,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m55s)

complex whereas this is a little bit


[01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:05,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h00m57s)

simpler so we have tokens tokens have


[01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m04s)

been there for since the beginning


[01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:10,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m05s)

roughly right a token is I took a string


[01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:13,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m08s)

and I categorize it that's what a parts


[01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:15,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m10s)

are knots before doing the core parsing


[01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:16,799](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m13s)

most parsers do tokenization which they


[01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m15s)

categorize them so you'll see this is


[01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:20,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m16s)

token type and these are the different


[01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m18s)

token types that exists in system


[01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,369](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m20s)

connect like a lot of parsers we'll get


[01:01:24,930 --> 01:01:27,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m24s)

even more detailed about tokenization


[01:01:26,369 --> 01:01:29,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m26s)

and we might get there eventually you


[01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:30,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m27s)

might have tokens for things like the


[01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m29s)

opening square bracket and closing


[01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m30s)

square bracket on your directive or you


[01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:41,279](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m33s)

might have a token for a colon that


[01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:43,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m36s)

separates an option from Arne our


[01:01:41,279 --> 01:01:46,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m41s)

organizer is not that detailed it hasn't


[01:01:43,079 --> 01:01:48,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m43s)

been added needing to be and in order to


[01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:50,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m46s)

keep the API surface similar enough to


[01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:51,779](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m48s)

be able to switch on the using parser


[01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:54,029](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m50s)

flag and go down one path or the other


[01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:56,309](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m51s)

and have the exact same test if it was


[01:01:54,029 --> 01:01:59,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m54s)

useful not to not to try to add


[01:01:56,309 --> 01:02:03,809](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m56s)

functionality yeah at that level gonna


[01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:08,039](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h01m59s)

come yeah yeah I will say this this


[01:02:03,809 --> 01:02:11,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m03s)

feels very Roslyn esque for anyone who's


[01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:14,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m08s)

maybe built like their own analyzer


[01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:18,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m11s)

mm-hmm very similar to that same type of


[01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m14s)

structure yeah yeah definitely I mean I


[01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:22,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m18s)

I spent a bunch of time looking at the


[01:02:20,549 --> 01:02:28,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m20s)

Rosalind source code and and thinking


[01:02:22,529 --> 01:02:30,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m22s)

about you know more you know the way


[01:02:28,529 --> 01:02:33,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m28s)

parsers are built by people who know how


[01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,769](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m30s)

to build parsers right there's certain


[01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m33s)

kind of rules and structures to them


[01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:38,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m34s)

that are really pretty common and I


[01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:39,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m35s)

never took a parser class or else you


[01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m38s)

know I would have probably known that


[01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:43,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m39s)

but


[01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:44,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m40s)

I had a sense of it and so it was a good


[01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m43s)

learning experience to kind of dig into


[01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:49,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m44s)

this and say okay how do you how do you


[01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:51,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m45s)

how do you actually build a parcel real


[01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m49s)

quick there is a question out there of


[01:02:51,010 --> 01:03:01,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m51s)

you want to go back and give a brief


[01:02:52,660 --> 01:03:01,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h02m52s)

overview of what a directive is yeah so


[01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:07,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m01s)

when you're an example a directive the


[01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:08,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m05s)

direct a drunken token is this right


[01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:11,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m07s)

here


[01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:14,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m08s)

parce is if we're talking about just you


[01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:16,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m11s)

know the language or the you know what


[01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:18,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m14s)

are the what of a syntax context that


[01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:21,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m16s)

exists on the command line in system


[01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:22,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m18s)

command line we added this idea of a


[01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:25,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m21s)

directive which you don't see this in


[01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:30,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m22s)

other this is as far as I know this is a


[01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:32,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m25s)

fairly novel concept and it solves a few


[01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:40,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m30s)

different problems so say I want to do


[01:03:32,890 --> 01:03:42,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m32s)

done that try demo output well in this


[01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m40s)

case what the directive is doing is it


[01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:46,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m42s)

saying I'm actually gonna change the


[01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:48,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m45s)

meaning of everything that comes after


[01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:50,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m46s)

it on the command line and I'm gonna


[01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:52,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m48s)

give you back a representation of


[01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:54,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m50s)

effectively of the abstract syntax tree


[01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:58,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m52s)

of a parse result all right so it's a


[01:03:54,730 --> 01:04:00,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m54s)

way of using the parser rather than


[01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h03m58s)

using it to go and call my command and


[01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:05,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m00s)

actually invoke my app I'm saying tell


[01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:07,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m02s)

me how you interpret the symbol right so


[01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:10,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m05s)

you can see here this sort of nested


[01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:12,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m07s)

structure where Donna try as a command


[01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:14,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m10s)

demo as a command here's the output


[01:04:12,610 --> 01:04:17,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m12s)

option is the value that was passed to


[01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:21,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m14s)

the output options argument this little


[01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:24,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m17s)

asterisk here means implicit so add


[01:04:21,670 --> 01:04:26,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m21s)

packaged source was implicitly supplies


[01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:27,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m24s)

because we have we defined a default for


[01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:29,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m26s)

it and we configured the parser so


[01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:34,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m27s)

that's what this is doing if I had said


[01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m29s)

something like it's a good one like


[01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m38s)

that's a comment huh


[01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:50,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m43s)

yeah there we go


[01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:55,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m45s)

oh that's interesting I'm trying to give


[01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:58,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m50s)

it some invalid input output seems


[01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:03,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m55s)

pretty what's a character that is both


[01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:06,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h04m58s)

not so say I think something you said


[01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m03s)

earlier that I think made it sound


[01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:14,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m06s)

fairly clear as a directive in its


[01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:18,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m08s)

general sense is sort of a cross-cutting


[01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:20,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m14s)

command or behavior for command line so


[01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:23,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m18s)

it's not necessarily specifically tied


[01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:25,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m20s)

to any one type of command line but they


[01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m23s)

usually represent common functionality


[01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:29,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m25s)

that you might want to cross all of them


[01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m26s)

so yeah as far as the question of is it


[01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m29s)

just for debugging the the parse


[01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m31s)

directive is largely just for debugging


[01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:40,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m33s)

but there's other directives that that


[01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:44,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m36s)

exist out there for various purposes


[01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:47,440](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m40s)

there is some directives in there around


[01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:50,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m44s)

the the rendering stuff and far as far


[01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m47s)

as like enabling or disabling vt100 that


[01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:56,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m50s)

kind of thing so again they're they're


[01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:59,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m53s)

more cross-cutting options that you


[01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:02,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m56s)

might apply to to any command line app


[01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:05,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h05m59s)

rather than just one specific one yep


[01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m02s)

yeah that's a good way to put it


[01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:15,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m05s)

I've also made the analogy that they're


[01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:20,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m07s)

kind of like HTTP headers here well I'm


[01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:21,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m15s)

sorry the suggestion feature and the way


[01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m20s)

that this works is also with a directive


[01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m21s)

so what's happening here as I tab


[01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:29,200](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m24s)

through it saying you know these are all


[01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:31,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m26s)

valid input at this at this level the


[01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m29s)

core parser itself understands SM is


[01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:35,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m31s)

able to output suggestions so how do you


[01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m33s)

ask it for suggestions right this is


[01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:39,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m35s)

this is the dotnet try application it


[01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m37s)

doesn't have any special logic in it to


[01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:44,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m39s)

do suggestions there's no custom script


[01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:45,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m41s)

that's specific to.net try to do


[01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:47,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m44s)

suggestions which would that's kind of


[01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:49,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m45s)

the traditional way to provide suggest


[01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m47s)

the command line do you write a bash


[01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:53,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m49s)

you've read a shot scrap paper it'll be


[01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:56,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m51s)

bash specific a Power Shot specifically


[01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:59,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m53s)

so the way that this works in some


[01:06:56,740 --> 01:07:01,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m56s)

command line is we have a suggestive


[01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:04,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h06m59s)

directive


[01:07:01,590 --> 01:07:07,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m01s)

alright so suggest says hey take the


[01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:10,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m04s)

input parse it tell me what are the


[01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:13,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m07s)

valid suggestions at this point right


[01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:14,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m10s)

and then that's that's the way lit a


[01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:18,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m13s)

little bit we have another application


[01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:21,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m14s)

Kanban that suggests which we have a


[01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:24,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m18s)

script that passes the input through


[01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:25,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m21s)

dotnet suggest to your application using


[01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m24s)

the suggest directive to get back the


[01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:29,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m25s)

suggestions all right so it's again it's


[01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:32,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m28s)

a cross-cutting piece of functionality


[01:07:29,860 --> 01:07:33,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m29s)

you get you sort of opt into this


[01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:36,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m32s)

functionality by using system command


[01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:38,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m33s)

line and as long as you have an


[01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m36s)

application that sort of follows this


[01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:43,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m38s)

protocol which we provide for you in the


[01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:47,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m40s)

box then the suggestions feature works


[01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:49,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m43s)

so that quirks with it directive as well


[01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:51,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m47s)

you could have and you could it the


[01:07:49,870 --> 01:07:52,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m49s)

mechanism extensible so you could add


[01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m51s)

directives for anything that you might


[01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:58,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m52s)

want to you could add your own


[01:07:54,430 --> 01:08:00,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m54s)

directives via the middleware mechanism


[01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:03,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h07m58s)

you could have a directors for you know


[01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:07,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m00s)

logging or whatever you could think of


[01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:07,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m03s)

it we've used it for a bunch of thing


[01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:20,719](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m12s)

sorry did you show your there for a


[01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:20,719](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m14s)

little bit no no cool questions are good


[01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:29,159](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m21s)

so what this to get back to the new


[01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:30,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m24s)

parser what this thing is doing pretty


[01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:32,429](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m29s)

similar to the old one it takes in two


[01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:34,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m30s)

arguments raw input right it has to


[01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:36,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m32s)

conform to the same ap it in fact


[01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m34s)

inherits the old parser that made it


[01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m36s)

easier to shim it into a bunch of places


[01:08:38,339 --> 01:08:43,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m38s)

like the command-line configuration as a


[01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:47,339](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m40s)

reference to the parser and so on we so


[01:08:43,469 --> 01:08:49,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m43s)

we tokenize things the tokenizer has


[01:08:47,339 --> 01:08:51,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m47s)

been rewritten I'd taken the same


[01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:53,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m49s)

approach but the old one is gone now so


[01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m51s)

the tokenizer takes in strings and it


[01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,449](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m53s)

returns a bunch of a tokenized results


[01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m55s)

so here's those tokens again the


[01:08:57,449 --> 01:09:00,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m57s)

different categories of tokens as well


[01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:03,179](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h08m58s)

as at errors so then we take the


[01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:07,279](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m00s)

tokenize result sometimes this is also


[01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:09,449](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m03s)

known as lexing and parsing


[01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:13,259](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m07s)

terminology lexer a tokenizer or the


[01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:15,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m09s)

same thing so now we have a parse


[01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:17,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m13s)

operation this is the new this is a new


[01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:20,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m15s)

internal class that is driving the new


[01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:22,529](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m17s)

parser what is what is that we tell it


[01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:25,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m20s)

to parse and then we have that this


[01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,549](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m22s)

partial result visitor and the partial


[01:09:25,139 --> 01:09:28,259](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m25s)

result visitor we tell it to visit this


[01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:30,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m26s)

route command node thing which is one of


[01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:33,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m28s)

these syntax node types and then we


[01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:35,609](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m30s)

return the visitor result so this is


[01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:41,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m33s)

kind of the high level structure an


[01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:43,969](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m35s)

endorser so let's look at the first


[01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,969](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m41s)

operation


[01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:50,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m47s)

you can see that this is tracking state


[01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:53,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m48s)

so this is basically iterating over the


[01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:54,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m50s)

tokens and figuring out what they mean


[01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:56,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m53s)

with relation to the command line


[01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m54s)

configuration what are the options you


[01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:59,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m56s)

specify where the arguments you know


[01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:02,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m57s)

when you configured this yeah I've got a


[01:09:59,889 --> 01:10:03,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h09m59s)

command called the command and it's got


[01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m02s)

these options and these options are


[01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:10,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m03s)

these argument and they should be these


[01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:13,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m04s)

types and so this is the style of parser


[01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:16,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m10s)

or something that it's a recursive


[01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:17,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m13s)

descent parser is the run description of


[01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:20,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m16s)

the kind of parser as a c-sharp parser


[01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:22,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m17s)

is also a recursive descent parser


[01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:28,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m20s)

obviously this one is vastly vastly


[01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:29,949](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m22s)

simpler and what this is doing here's


[01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:35,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m28s)

the basic operation there was a parse


[01:10:29,949 --> 01:10:38,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m29s)

math okay it starts with a root command


[01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:43,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m35s)

what a recursive descent parser does is


[01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:45,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m38s)

it recursive into some structure and it


[01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:50,639](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m43s)

called a bunch of what are supposed to


[01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:52,659](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m45s)

be mutually exclusive sub routines that


[01:10:50,639 --> 01:10:54,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m50s)

breaks things down into different


[01:10:52,659 --> 01:10:56,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m52s)

semantic groups one you can see here the


[01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m54s)

parse root command we know we're


[01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:00,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m56s)

starting with a root command but the


[01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:02,199](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h10m58s)

toker tokenizer normalizes that for us


[01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:06,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m00s)

so the root command will always be your


[01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:12,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m02s)

application in itself we say hey give me


[01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:13,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m06s)

the root command node and then this


[01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:15,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m12s)

advanced thing it's just it's just


[01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:16,719](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m13s)

iterating we're just we're just keeping


[01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:19,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m15s)

an index into our position inside of the


[01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:22,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m16s)

token list and we advance when we feel


[01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m19s)

like we've successfully categorized the


[01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m22s)

current token we move on to the next


[01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,639](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m23s)

token and so for each one we said okay


[01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:30,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m26s)

well what are the things that we want to


[01:11:27,639 --> 01:11:31,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m27s)

parse at this stage directives always


[01:11:30,130 --> 01:11:33,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m30s)

this is one of the rule directors always


[01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m31s)

have to come at the beginning so you can


[01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:37,119](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m33s)

really see the high-level parse


[01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m34s)

operation in parser code we start with


[01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:42,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m37s)

the directives then we parse command


[01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:44,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m39s)

children right and sub commands can be


[01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:46,679](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m42s)

nested as deeply as you want to go so


[01:11:44,889 --> 01:11:48,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m44s)

this is where things get recursive and


[01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:49,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m46s)

then there's this partial mating program


[01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:51,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m48s)

please most of the work is actually


[01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m49s)

happening inside of parsed command


[01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:56,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m51s)

children they say as long as there's


[01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:57,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m53s)

more tokens and if it's not the end of


[01:11:56,739 --> 01:12:02,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m56s)

the arguments


[01:11:57,850 --> 01:12:03,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h11m57s)

that double-dash thing then we say the


[01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:05,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m02s)

child is either going to be a sub


[01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:08,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m03s)

command or it's going to be an option or


[01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:10,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m05s)

it's going to be argument if we don't


[01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m08s)

match any of them in some math token we


[01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:13,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m10s)

move on to the next one


[01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:16,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m11s)

otherwise we add it at the child node


[01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m13s)

all right this is itself recursive so we


[01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:19,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m16s)

patently passed the command note in two


[01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:24,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m17s)

parts tub command so what is far so


[01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:26,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m19s)

command ooh well I think that looks for


[01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:28,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m24s)

a command that might be appropriate at


[01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m26s)

that level so I've got a command and it


[01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m28s)

goes again into parse command children


[01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:35,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m30s)

so you can see that this structure can


[01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:36,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m31s)

recurse endlessly that doesn't make


[01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:39,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m35s)

sense do you want to do a step through


[01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:41,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m36s)

it I think it makes sense but I wouldn't


[01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m39s)

mind like grabbing one of those unit


[01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:47,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m41s)

tests and walking through this just to


[01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:47,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m42s)

to see it yeah


[01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,969](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m50s)

let's take a look at let's do one the


[01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:57,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m52s)

pack is because that could be probably


[01:12:54,969 --> 01:12:57,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h12m54s)

left confusing


[01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:07,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m04s)

I suggest


[01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m13s)

hello


[01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:23,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m16s)

seems simple enough we've got a command


[01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:26,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m19s)

of one one has a sub command of two and


[01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:30,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m23s)

three two has a sub command of three as


[01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:33,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m26s)

well yeah okay there's a little bit of


[01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:36,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m30s)

ambiguity there potentially right right


[01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:38,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m33s)

because once you do the one two three


[01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:41,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m36s)

that three we expect to be the sub


[01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:52,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m38s)

command of two not the sibling of


[01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:52,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m41s)

sub-command - yeah let's start with


[01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h13m57s)

Parsons we're going to debug version two


[01:14:11,830 --> 01:14:18,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m11s)

yeah so what do we have here we have an


[01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:20,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m16s)

index of zero that's our position inside


[01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m18s)

of the arguments that were passed in for


[01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:24,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m20s)

the tokens or patent let's take a look


[01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:25,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m22s)

at the tokenize result in rubber we're


[01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m24s)

coming from the tokenizer here


[01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m25s)

so the tokenizer has already done some


[01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:33,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m27s)

pre categorization so here's our token


[01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:34,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m29s)

hydra's all right so far and so i didn't


[01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,700](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m33s)

didn't produce any errors add three


[01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:38,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m34s)

tokens command one command to come in


[01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:39,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m36s)

three but it doesn't understand


[01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m38s)

tokenizer doesn't understand the


[01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:47,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m39s)

hierarchy of them they're just tokens


[01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:48,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m42s)

into the flowerless so we're going to


[01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:52,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m47s)

start but we always start with parsing


[01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:54,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m48s)

the root command all right so current


[01:14:52,390 --> 01:15:00,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m52s)

token that's command one current token


[01:14:54,850 --> 01:15:02,620](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h14m54s)

is a really simple little method they


[01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:07,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m00s)

just offsets into the token list of


[01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:08,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m02s)

corporate by the index so I so advanced


[01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m07s)

when we call advanced it will increment


[01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:11,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m08s)

the token so current token will always


[01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:15,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m10s)

continue to return that's the current


[01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:17,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m11s)

one the configuration root command this


[01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:18,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m15s)

is this is our description of the parser


[01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m17s)

configuration there's a lot of


[01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:24,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m18s)

information in here is what we're


[01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:30,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m19s)

parsing against okay so this is a root


[01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:30,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m24s)

command token to root man there's one


[01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:35,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m30s)

non-terminal syntax node means it can


[01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m33s)

have children


[01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m40s)

we keep a reference to the I command


[01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:47,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m42s)

object right so this is the thing that


[01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:47,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m44s)

we configured in the task on the right


[01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:56,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m52s)

this command instances of the thing with


[01:15:54,249 --> 01:16:00,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m54s)

the token that refers to all right so


[01:15:56,619 --> 01:16:01,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h15m56s)

here's our this syntax node you know we


[01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:03,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m00s)

know what the token is that was passed


[01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:05,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m01s)

in we know which command object at


[01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m03s)

references so far we don't have any


[01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,499](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m05s)

children


[01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:17,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m09s)

so we advanced just increment the index


[01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:20,019](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m14s)

now we're gonna parse directives so more


[01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:24,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m17s)

says is the index less than the number


[01:16:20,019 --> 01:16:27,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m20s)

of tokens yep there's more current token


[01:16:24,909 --> 01:16:32,949](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m24s)

is to the token type is not a directive


[01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:34,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m27s)

so the dominant person grants one of the


[01:16:32,949 --> 01:16:37,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m32s)

rules of directives is that they have to


[01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:39,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m34s)

come first they come directly under the


[01:16:37,510 --> 01:16:41,559](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m37s)

route command but once you're done once


[01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:43,389](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m39s)

you encounter a token that isn't


[01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:46,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m41s)

directive no more nothing else will be


[01:16:43,389 --> 01:16:50,979](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m43s)

counted as a director if we did one


[01:16:46,650 --> 01:16:53,949](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m46s)

square brackets parse two square


[01:16:50,979 --> 01:16:55,809](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m50s)

brackets something else that second


[01:16:53,949 --> 01:16:57,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m53s)

square brackets instance would be just a


[01:16:55,809 --> 01:16:59,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m55s)

no it wouldn't be indirect counter the


[01:16:57,190 --> 01:17:03,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m57s)

director took the temp it is an argument


[01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:07,539](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h16m59s)

or something so a parsing command


[01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:09,489](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m03s)

children now okay so there's there is


[01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:13,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m07s)

more it's not the end of the arguments


[01:17:09,489 --> 01:17:13,989](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m09s)

yet so parent is one we're gonna go into


[01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:18,239](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m13s)

parse sub-command


[01:17:13,989 --> 01:17:18,239](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m13s)

it is a command token type


[01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:26,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m20s)

right we find that there is a command


[01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m23s)

that has that name - all right it


[01:17:26,820 --> 01:17:33,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m26s)

matched something that is in the


[01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:35,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m27s)

configured list of commands so we'll


[01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:37,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m33s)

create a command or switch of the mother


[01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:39,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m35s)

just like we saw before is the type of


[01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:42,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m37s)

syntax note just like the read command


[01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:45,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m39s)

okay so we've got a command mode we're


[01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:46,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m42s)

going to advanced and now we're gonna


[01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:49,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m45s)

say well does it have children right and


[01:17:46,830 --> 01:17:51,239](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m46s)

this would if we had a hierarchy that


[01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:52,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m49s)

was a hundred sub-command beeps this


[01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:54,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m51s)

would just keep rehearsing farther and


[01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:56,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m52s)

farther into that structure all right if


[01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m54s)

you think about the way see sharpest


[01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:59,159](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m56s)

parts that can have expressions inside


[01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:00,929](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m57s)

of expressions inside of discretion side


[01:17:59,159 --> 01:18:02,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h17m59s)

expression so the recursive descent


[01:18:00,929 --> 01:18:03,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m00s)

parser gives you a way to kind of keep


[01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:06,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m02s)

just digging and digging and digging as


[01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,219](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m03s)

long as that syntax as long as that


[01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:11,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m06s)

grammatical concept in your grammar is


[01:18:08,219 --> 01:18:12,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m08s)

itself recursive and the parser follow


[01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:17,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m11s)

the code structure and the parser


[01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:20,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m12s)

follows the structure of a timer so it's


[01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m17s)

easier to reason about than our old


[01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m20s)

parser one certainly I completely agree


[01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:26,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m22s)

with that this is by far simpler to step


[01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:29,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m25s)

through and understand what's going on


[01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:29,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m26s)

yeah


[01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:36,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m30s)

it also uses a lot left link so the


[01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:39,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m34s)

number of allocations should be vastly


[01:18:36,699 --> 01:18:40,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m36s)

lower so for from a performance


[01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:42,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m39s)

standpoint of this parser


[01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:43,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m40s)

I haven't measured it yet but I'm pretty


[01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:50,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m42s)

confident this parser will be a lot


[01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:52,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m43s)

faster than the old version as well okay


[01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:55,900](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m50s)

so in this case I mean we've got a child


[01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:59,619](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m52s)

child node 3 if we rehearse all the way


[01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:02,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m55s)

in to that inner command right and now


[01:18:59,619 --> 01:19:05,969](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h18m59s)

we're going to come back out more was


[01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:11,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m02s)

false return this come in notice it is -


[01:19:05,969 --> 01:19:18,219](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m05s)

coming back out add that one to the tree


[01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:20,199](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m11s)

coming out there's no more again ok so


[01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:21,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m18s)

we're done parsing command children


[01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:24,369](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m20s)

everything everything with a command


[01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:27,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m21s)

child in ok so here's our route command


[01:19:24,369 --> 01:19:33,610](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m24s)

node and you can see now it has a child


[01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:36,849](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m27s)

which is - which have a child 3 ok this


[01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:41,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m33s)

is this is a a more true abstract syntax


[01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:44,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m36s)

tree than what we had before parse


[01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:46,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m41s)

remaining tokens so you if you want to


[01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m44s)

if you wanted to step through it again


[01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:48,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m46s)

with an example that uses the end of


[01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:50,889](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m47s)

arguments then you could see what that


[01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:54,369](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m48s)

means that remaining tokens basically


[01:19:50,889 --> 01:19:55,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m50s)

means was there other stuff that didn't


[01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m54s)

fit underneath any of the command so the


[01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:59,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m55s)

double dash in the POSIX Convention that


[01:19:57,699 --> 01:20:01,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m57s)

says everything after this just gather


[01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h19m59s)

it up and give it back to me but don't


[01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:05,980](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m01s)

worry about what its structure is it's


[01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:09,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m04s)

just a bunch of its open data vector


[01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:10,659](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m05s)

stuff the other things that can be in


[01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:12,369](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m09s)

the remaining token about the unpark


[01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:15,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m10s)

open if we find tokens were like I don't


[01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:17,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m12s)

know what this is don't imagine it then


[01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:20,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m15s)

those can be returned as on parse tokens


[01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:20,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m17s)

on Nash Hogan


[01:20:23,140 --> 01:20:31,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m23s)

so they are cool now we've got our we've


[01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:35,500](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m29s)

got hanging off of the operation we're


[01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:38,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m31s)

not done yet though so here's that root


[01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m35s)

command node right we grab that we don't


[01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:41,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m38s)

have unmatched poke tokens their own


[01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m39s)

parse token you don't have a nurse so


[01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:46,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m41s)

that's all good but now to conform with


[01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m44s)

the pre-existing API we now need to take


[01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:50,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m46s)

the syntax tree and turn it into those


[01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:51,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m47s)

command results option results and you


[01:20:50,020 --> 01:20:56,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m50s)

know argument result objects we had


[01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:58,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m51s)

before how do we do that so this is kind


[01:20:56,230 --> 01:21:00,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m56s)

of the step now where we really like the


[01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:03,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h20m58s)

new parser is really more decoupled from


[01:21:00,310 --> 01:21:08,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m00s)

those other from from the object model


[01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:10,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m03s)

that we want to get through so we have a


[01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:16,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m08s)

partial results visit but the visitor


[01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:18,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m10s)

dies let's skip the constructor and just


[01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:20,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m16s)

go right to visit we pass in the route


[01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:21,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m18s)

command note and what this does is it


[01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m20s)

recursive down the syntax tree and


[01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:26,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m21s)

builds up some other thing you could


[01:21:24,490 --> 01:21:28,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m24s)

have a visitor that does any number of


[01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:30,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m26s)

things so maybe we'll end up with a


[01:21:28,030 --> 01:21:33,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m28s)

visitor for help or maybe we'll end up


[01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:34,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m30s)

with a visitor for suggestions or maybe


[01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:37,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m33s)

those things all work today so there's


[01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:40,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m34s)

not necessarily a structure but driving


[01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:42,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m37s)

need to rewrite them but you can think


[01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m40s)

of the visitor as you know a reasonably


[01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:47,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m42s)

efficient and again pretty easy to


[01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:48,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m44s)

reason about way to take the syntax tree


[01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:50,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m47s)

and do something with and in this case


[01:21:48,910 --> 01:21:55,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m48s)

that's something we're doing is building


[01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:57,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m50s)

a partial hold on tree right so here's


[01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:59,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m55s)

our command node I'm building a group


[01:21:57,820 --> 01:22:00,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m57s)

command result so this is that old


[01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:01,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h21m59s)

command results object that we were


[01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:04,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m00s)

looking at before that was kind of


[01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:08,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m01s)

complaining that the structure with the


[01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:12,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m04s)

model binding side and then we just


[01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:13,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m08s)

iterate over its children and so what


[01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m12s)

you can see if you look at the structure


[01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:17,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m13s)

of this thing on the left here a leader


[01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:20,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m15s)

it just has methods for visiting all of


[01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:22,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m17s)

the difference in syntax node types and


[01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:28,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m20s)

so all its really doing is just building


[01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:30,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m22s)

up sort of the the parsing


[01:22:28,090 --> 01:22:32,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m28s)

which are API both the old version and


[01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m30s)

the new version of the API they're using


[01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:36,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m32s)

them or that that part of the API have


[01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:40,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m34s)

not changed we change the parser


[01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:43,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m36s)

underneath that but that API surface of


[01:22:40,260 --> 01:22:44,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m40s)

the parse result class and its children


[01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:46,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m43s)

has not been changed which is why all


[01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:51,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m44s)

the tests can work again for free


[01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:51,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m46s)

[Applause]


[01:22:51,679 --> 01:23:01,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m51s)

so yeah just to come back out to the


[01:22:53,570 --> 01:23:01,630](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h22m53s)

test here's my personal


[01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m06s)

cool and the string representation is


[01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:13,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m09s)

just that diagram which is the same as


[01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:17,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m11s)

the what the parse directive ends up


[01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:17,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m13s)

giving us exactly


[01:23:22,860 --> 01:23:32,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m22s)

seems so simple but simple code is


[01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:36,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m27s)

always the hardest to write yeah you


[01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:39,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m32s)

know it simple but it wasn't simple when


[01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:44,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m36s)

it started the first iteration was not


[01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:45,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m39s)

simple but this one got easier well I


[01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m44s)

think the same is until you've rewritten


[01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:51,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m45s)

your library the third time it's not


[01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:55,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m48s)

actually good so isn't this number 2 or


[01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:56,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m51s)

3 I think this might be number 3 so


[01:23:55,170 --> 01:24:00,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m55s)

number one is the one that's in the


[01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:02,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h23m56s)

dotnet CLI number number two is the one


[01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:03,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m00s)

that's been called system command-line


[01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:08,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m02s)

since around the time that you joined


[01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:11,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m03s)

the project so at this point it should


[01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:15,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m08s)

be getting rather rather stable then I


[01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:17,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m11s)

think so yeah I mean the simplicity of


[01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:19,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m15s)

the parser is something to get back to


[01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m17s)

the original reason for this refactor


[01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:23,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m19s)

right making that parser simpler and


[01:24:21,510 --> 01:24:24,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m21s)

easier to reason about should also make


[01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:26,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m23s)

it easier to change its behavior and


[01:24:24,540 --> 01:24:28,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m24s)

extend it and so being able to add


[01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:33,600](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m26s)

multiple arguments now should be a lot


[01:24:28,890 --> 01:24:38,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m28s)

more straightforward that makes a lot of


[01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m33s)

sense then because in theory it's just a


[01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:40,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m38s)

matter of going through and saying


[01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:42,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m39s)

rather than looking for a single


[01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:45,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m40s)

argument add an extra one inside of that


[01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:50,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m42s)

method that was handling the was a


[01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:50,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m45s)

command node command syntax node yeah


[01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:58,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m51s)

seems like this just based on what you


[01:24:55,500 --> 01:25:00,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m55s)

showed that you're fairly close maybe


[01:24:58,830 --> 01:25:05,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h24m58s)

that's a bad assessment since there was


[01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:07,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m00s)

a bunch of failing unit tests but is the


[01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:12,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m05s)

intent then before this merges to


[01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:16,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m07s)

ultimately whack all of the v-2 unit


[01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:20,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m12s)

tests and just have that static property


[01:25:16,530 --> 01:25:23,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m16s)

go away and the true version of it be


[01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:26,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m20s)

the only thing that remains yep yeah


[01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:29,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m23s)

that that use parser method or use new


[01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:32,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m26s)

parser method now we can look at the


[01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m29s)

places where this is in use what this is


[01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:37,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m32s)

really doing


[01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:39,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m33s)

is it's just like a you know while we


[01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:43,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m37s)

replace the plumbing this is the this is


[01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:46,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m39s)

the diversion pipe that things can run


[01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:48,330](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m43s)

through which is a diverter we have two


[01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m46s)

different code paths we can take but we


[01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:51,300](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m48s)

only need two code paths to make sure


[01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m50s)

that we don't break the old


[01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:59,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m51s)

functionality while we're building the


[01:25:52,710 --> 01:26:01,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m52s)

new functionality right actually in the


[01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:03,090](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h25m59s)

middle of a large refactor on one of my


[01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:05,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m01s)

projects at work and I'm kind of wishing


[01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:07,890](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m03s)

I had adopted a structure like this


[01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:11,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m05s)

because right now the solution is I'm


[01:26:07,890 --> 01:26:14,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m07s)

the project's cloned twice mmm once pre


[01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:16,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m11s)

refactor once post refactor and so you


[01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:19,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m14s)

do have that issue of when you're


[01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:22,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m16s)

halfway through there's a bit of


[01:26:19,290 --> 01:26:24,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m19s)

confusion of is this something new that


[01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:29,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m22s)

I broke something that you know you used


[01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:32,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m24s)

to work differently and yeah I'm going


[01:26:29,970 --> 01:26:36,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m29s)

to be stealing this trick on future


[01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:38,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m32s)

projects this is a good one yeah it's a


[01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m36s)

pretty good one I put it it took me a


[01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:42,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m38s)

bunch of head-scratching to figure out


[01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m39s)

how to approach the testing so that the


[01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:46,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m42s)

refactor could be done in a very gradual


[01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:49,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m44s)

way where I was always moving forward


[01:26:46,740 --> 01:26:50,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m46s)

you know it's really unfortunate when


[01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:53,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m49s)

you get into the middle of a big


[01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:54,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m50s)

refactor and you're like oh I've hit a


[01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:59,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m53s)

dead end and I now need to figure out


[01:26:54,540 --> 01:27:01,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m54s)

how to unwind all of this right so the


[01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:05,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h26m59s)

test design is really critical for being


[01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:09,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m01s)

able to say lay out a strategy from for


[01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:09,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m05s)

making deterministic forward progress


[01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:15,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m09s)

yeah and I think this really helps with


[01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:17,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m12s)

that issue of needing to step back


[01:27:15,810 --> 01:27:20,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m15s)

because with this it doesn't feel like


[01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:23,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m17s)

you really need to step back


[01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:23,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m20s)

that much no


[01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:27,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m24s)

cool


[01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:38,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m28s)

well sweet I guess then one last little


[01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:38,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m32s)

bit not to divert too much from this but


[01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:45,400](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m38s)

so this refactor is currently being done


[01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:47,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m42s)

out on a branch on your fork what about


[01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:51,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m45s)

stuff if people want to actually get


[01:27:47,080 --> 01:27:52,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m47s)

involved and commit back where would you


[01:27:51,100 --> 01:27:56,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m51s)

suggest somebody dive in and get started


[01:27:52,840 --> 01:27:57,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m52s)

or take a look at I mean obviously the


[01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:00,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m56s)

the easiest thing to do for anybody


[01:27:57,940 --> 01:28:02,380](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h27m57s)

wanting to help out is just pull it down


[01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:05,949](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m00s)

and use it and provide feedback I mean


[01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:08,080](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m02s)

that's invaluable right there but if


[01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:09,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m05s)

somebody actually wanted to to do some


[01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:14,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m08s)

work and submit a pull request where


[01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:17,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m09s)

would you suggest starting from well so


[01:28:14,469 --> 01:28:18,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m14s)

if we look in the github repo it's got


[01:28:17,469 --> 01:28:22,210](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m17s)

plenty of issues in them and some of


[01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:31,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m18s)

them have tags on them like good first


[01:28:22,210 --> 01:28:31,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m22s)

issue feel like


[01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:40,280](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m35s)

oh there is that I go back and pay that


[01:28:38,510 --> 01:28:43,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m38s)

person had a very busy we can drop that


[01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:47,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m40s)

one in the floor so good first issue if


[01:28:43,010 --> 01:28:50,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m43s)

we look at the labels here it you know


[01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:52,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m47s)

these are things that we we've tagged


[01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:55,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m50s)

these issues specifically because we


[01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:56,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m52s)

think they're scoped enough that someone


[01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:58,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m55s)

who's not super familiar with the code


[01:28:56,450 --> 01:29:02,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m56s)

base has a reasonable chance of


[01:28:58,310 --> 01:29:05,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h28m58s)

succeeding and also the the general rule


[01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:10,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m02s)

in the in the.net team for when when we


[01:29:05,570 --> 01:29:12,230](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m05s)

apply the good first issue label it also


[01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:19,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m10s)

means we have volunteered to help


[01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:21,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m12s)

someone move a PR to completion so yeah


[01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:24,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m19s)

anything with a good first issue on it


[01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:26,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m21s)

there is someone on the team signed up


[01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:29,450](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m24s)

to help you if you if you want a grant


[01:29:26,830 --> 01:29:30,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m26s)

so that's a good start Help Wanted is


[01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:32,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m29s)

here to help want it and good for it


[01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:34,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m30s)

first issue typically go together


[01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:37,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m32s)

although Help Wanted sometimes might be


[01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:38,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m34s)

a little bit more than box you have one


[01:29:37,670 --> 01:29:41,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m37s)

let's help wanted but not good first to


[01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:41,680](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m38s)

show I don't think we do so that's a


[01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:44,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m41s)

good way to start


[01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:46,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m41s)

and then there's tons of other issues


[01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:47,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m44s)

which you know they're all up for grabs


[01:29:46,220 --> 01:29:49,550](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m46s)

if they don't have someone's face on


[01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:50,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m47s)

which is mostly the case with trying to


[01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:54,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m49s)

have too many things in flight at the


[01:29:50,570 --> 01:29:55,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m50s)

same time so there's lots of stuff in


[01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:58,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m54s)

here and they're categorized you know


[01:29:55,430 --> 01:30:04,940](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m55s)

some of them are bugs phone bill


[01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:06,530](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h29m58s)

enhancement one other thing I'll point


[01:30:04,940 --> 01:30:09,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m04s)

out too I think there's a link on the


[01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:11,510](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m06s)

readme but there is also a getter


[01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:14,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m09s)

chatroom too if somebody just wants to


[01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:17,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m11s)

pop in with a quick question or comment


[01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:20,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m14s)

I believe it's linked right at the top


[01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:22,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m17s)

yeah so if anybody wants to jump in or


[01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:24,350](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m20s)

you've got feedback or question or


[01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:25,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m22s)

running into a problem that's a good


[01:30:24,350 --> 01:30:29,540](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m24s)

quick place if there's not a


[01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:33,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m25s)

corresponding issue to type a comment or


[01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:37,100](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m29s)

question on as well yeah

[01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:48,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m37s)

answering questions about how to use


[01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:51,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m38s)

anything ago and Twitter works - awesome

wanted to look at or did anyone have any


[01:30:53,690 --> 01:31:00,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m53s)

questions or thoughts I may end up rat I


[01:30:57,890 --> 01:31:01,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h30m57s)

normally go to ish hours but I'm a wrap


[01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:04,220](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m00s)

this one up early I had an early morning


[01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:11,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m01s)

so I don't quite hit the two hour mark


[01:31:04,220 --> 01:31:14,000](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m04s)

this time I'll be ok thanks for jumping


[01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:16,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m11s)

on with us John I've I've missed our


[01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:23,120](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m14s)

coding session so this is it was good to


[01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:25,040](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m16s)

get this going my you know my not so


[01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:28,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m23s)

secret agenda was to nerd snipe you and


[01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:32,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m25s)

in order to get some some help from you


[01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:38,030](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m28s)

well and I'm always happy to dive in and


[01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:39,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m32s)

help as well well well while we're on


[01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:46,580](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m38s)

the topic of nerd sniping I'm gonna just


[01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:53,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m39s)

throw in something that I did because so


[01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:56,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m46s)

I ran into a issue the other day on one


[01:31:53,240 --> 01:32:00,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m53s)

of the projects where and this is


[01:31:56,180 --> 01:32:03,850](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h31m56s)

absolutely nothing related to system


[01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:07,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m00s)

command line but the need to go from a


[01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:09,800](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m03s)

type object for a given delegate type


[01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m07s)

and actually create an empty version of


[01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:17,690](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m09s)

said delegate so here


[01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:20,560](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m13s)

yeah I'll throw I'll throw a link to you


[01:32:17,690 --> 01:32:23,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m17s)

to this John and


[01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:27,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m20s)

so naturally I had to go through and do


[01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:31,370](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m23s)

it and it took it took several tries I


[01:32:27,430 --> 01:32:33,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m27s)

can pull it over onto my screen here if


[01:32:31,370 --> 01:32:36,140](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m31s)

anyone's interested this is the repo in


[01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:39,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m33s)

question but there's a so I put together


[01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:41,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m36s)

just a small unit test project but the


[01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:44,930](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m39s)

the interesting part in there is there


[01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:49,010](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m41s)

is a solution branch if you want to see


[01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:51,830](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m44s)

a fun way of going through and solving


[01:32:49,010 --> 01:32:53,750](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m49s)

it I I think I've covered most cases and


[01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:57,410](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m51s)

at least for the project in question it


[01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:59,150](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m53s)

covered all the cases that mattered not


[01:32:57,410 --> 01:33:06,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m57s)

100% confident I haven't missed


[01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:08,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h32m59s)

something somewhere but it does open up


[01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m06s)

the the solution ended up being less


[01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:15,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m08s)

than 40 lines of code including


[01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:17,720](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m10s)

whitespace which made me just happy and


[01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:20,660](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m15s)

there's certainly room for improvements


[01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:23,270](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m17s)

as far as like caching the the generator


[01:33:20,660 --> 01:33:25,310](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m20s)

delegate because obviously if it's an


[01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:31,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m23s)

empty delegate you can cache it by type


[01:33:25,310 --> 01:33:34,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m25s)

and get away with that just fine so on


[01:33:31,970 --> 01:33:35,840](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m31s)

the topic of nerd sniping if you if you


[01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:39,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m34s)

wanted a fun coding challenge there's


[01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:41,810](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m35s)

that that was one that I it came up and


[01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:43,790](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m39s)

we we sort of cheated it on the project


[01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:45,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m41s)

with mock initially and kind of worked


[01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:47,180](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m43s)

around it that way but I was like no


[01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:50,780](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m45s)

there's there's got to be a way to do


[01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:52,640](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m47s)

this and so I I had to attack it


[01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:54,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m50s)

expression trees was my first approach


[01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,910](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m52s)

but I ran into issues as soon as I got


[01:33:54,590 --> 01:34:01,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m54s)

to out in ref parameters just with the


[01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:03,920](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h33m58s)

limitations of expression trees you know


[01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:07,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m01s)

and so then I decided well let's just


[01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:07,240](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m03s)

keep going deeper so


[01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:17,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m07s)

me from made for a fun little project so


[01:34:17,769 --> 01:34:24,430](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m17s)

would be good time yeah


[01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:26,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m21s)

one way to burn the midnight oil is


[01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:28,760](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m24s)

getting nerd snack my problems at work


[01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:33,320](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m26s)

and then having to go home and solve


[01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:35,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m28s)

them yeah yeah a very like small scoped


[01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:39,740](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m33s)

but tricky problem what this is really


[01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:41,390](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m35s)

can be very entertaining yeah I figured


[01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:43,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m39s)

I spend a little over an hour on it just


[01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:44,470](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m41s)

kind of hacking away trying to figure


[01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:47,990](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m43s)

out what would work and what wouldn't


[01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:51,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m44s)

mm-hmm and then my personal favorite


[01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:57,290](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m47s)

that I did not realize is that void is


[01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:59,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m51s)

technically a value type which I had


[01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:01,490](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m57s)

never initially tripped up my code and


[01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:04,970](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h34m59s)

it took me a minute to realize what was


[01:35:01,490 --> 01:35:09,770](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m01s)

going on but then the other fun one is


[01:35:04,970 --> 01:35:14,060](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m04s)

the I don't know if you can see my


[01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:19,880](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m09s)

screen John probably not so the the


[01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:24,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m14s)

return type for value types it just pops


[01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:26,960](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m19s)

a zero onto the stack any value type


[01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:29,360](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m24s)

regardless of what it is because the


[01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,670](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m26s)

whole type conversion stuff is more a


[01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:35,020](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m29s)

c-sharp thing than an il thing so we'll


[01:35:31,670 --> 01:35:38,420](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m31s)

just treat the type system as a


[01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:44,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m35s)

suggestion not a hard and fast rule yeah


[01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:44,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m38s)

so it works


[01:35:44,820 --> 01:35:49,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m44s)

and then yeah some ugly stuff around and


[01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:52,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m47s)

generating up tasks because I didn't


[01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:56,070](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m49s)

want a Seng delegates to throw knowles


[01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:57,659](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m52s)

on a weights and again something that


[01:35:56,070 --> 01:36:02,639](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m56s)

probably should have been built in cash


[01:35:57,659 --> 01:36:08,099](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h35m57s)

somewhere but yeah good enough for good


[01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:11,190](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m02s)

enough for this well cool well thank you


[01:36:08,099 --> 01:36:13,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m08s)

everybody for jumping on John I will


[01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:14,730](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m11s)

probably so the video for this will be


[01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:17,039](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m13s)

up on twitch but I usually export them


[01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:20,099](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m14s)

to YouTube as well so that'll probably


[01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,599](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m17s)

show up here in the next day whenever I


[01:36:20,099 --> 01:36:26,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m20s)

get around to clicking the button and


[01:36:21,599 --> 01:36:29,309](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m21s)

applying the tags so well cool well you


[01:36:26,699 --> 01:36:30,869](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m26s)

have a good night and if you want to I'm


[01:36:29,309 --> 01:36:32,460](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m29s)

happy to jump on if you want to do some


[01:36:30,869 --> 01:36:34,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m30s)

pairing sessions on working through some


[01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:36,480](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m32s)

of the reasons reef actors or maybe I


[01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:38,309](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m34s)

might just pick up some of the issues on


[01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:40,349](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m36s)

on the repo I know there's also some


[01:36:38,309 --> 01:36:41,820](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m38s)

rendering stuff and I've found some bugs


[01:36:40,349 --> 01:36:44,909](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m40s)

while trying to use my own rendering


[01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:47,579](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m41s)

code that like wow I not unit test that


[01:36:44,909 --> 01:36:49,949](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m44s)

as well as I should have so I know there


[01:36:47,579 --> 01:36:51,719](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m47s)

are some issues in there that I may end


[01:36:49,949 --> 01:36:54,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m49s)

up having to just dive in and fix at


[01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:54,650](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m51s)

some point so


[01:36:55,599 --> 01:37:01,050](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m55s)

yeah I would there's no good amount of


[01:36:58,659 --> 01:37:03,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h36m58s)

interest in that stuff so getting that


[01:37:01,050 --> 01:37:05,170](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m01s)

getting that working and getting the API


[01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:06,849](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m03s)

into a more usable and stable state


[01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:08,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m05s)

would be great because especially with


[01:37:06,849 --> 01:37:10,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m06s)

the Windows terminal new windows


[01:37:08,739 --> 01:37:12,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m08s)

terminal I think that


[01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:17,079](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m10s)

vt100 stuff is going to have a


[01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:18,520](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m12s)

resurgence so eager idea


[01:37:17,079 --> 01:37:20,860](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m17s)

I would I would love help on this


[01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:29,110](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m18s)

particular piece as well and reshaping


[01:37:20,860 --> 01:37:33,250](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m20s)

the API getting number 310 fixed sorry


[01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:34,929](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m29s)

looking at this comment here tasks case


[01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:39,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m33s)

with generic it should use the other


[01:37:34,929 --> 01:37:39,570](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m34s)

code pass for value and reference types


[01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:44,489](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m41s)

let's see


[01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:55,260](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m47s)

I'm 36 so it won't so it shouldn't fall


[01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:57,489](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m52s)

into the value type one because the


[01:37:55,260 --> 01:38:00,130](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m55s)

checking on the return type of tasks


[01:37:57,489 --> 01:38:04,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h37m57s)

task itself this is this is the class


[01:38:00,130 --> 01:38:07,449](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m00s)

task not the the value task generation


[01:38:04,590 --> 01:38:09,340](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m04s)

to create the default value to be on the


[01:38:07,449 --> 01:38:14,710](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m07s)

stack before calling tasks from result


[01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:17,699](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m09s)

oh I see what you're saying so from


[01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:27,160](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m14s)

result needs to actually emit out the


[01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:31,870](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m17s)

the parameter for there I believe you


[01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:34,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m27s)

are correct my unit test is not good


[01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:34,469](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m31s)

enough for this


[01:38:37,629 --> 01:38:43,929](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m37s)

yeah no I think you're correct and that


[01:38:40,389 --> 01:38:47,349](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m40s)

is a bug in this because it really


[01:38:43,929 --> 01:38:53,139](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m43s)

should fall through and generate the


[01:38:47,349 --> 01:38:56,590](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m47s)

appropriate one yeah cuz I'm guessing my


[01:38:53,139 --> 01:38:59,559](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m53s)

unit tests must be let's see where is


[01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:01,719](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m56s)

[01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:06,639](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h38m59s)

working because my unit test is testing


[01:39:01,719 --> 01:39:08,739](https://youtu.be/wrzlI6q0m5E?t=01h39m01s)
