[done there we go okay sorry about that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m11s)



[apparently my mic settings got all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m15s)



[messed up somehow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m17s)



[so we are back in and going this is just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m18s)



[sort of an ad-hoc stream I was planning](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m22s)



[on doing some coding tonight and working](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m24s)



[through a project that I had started on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m25s)



[stream before so I figured I would go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m28s)



[through and just livestream the updates](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m30s)



[to it so if anyone has any questions](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m34s)



[there was a video that got posted I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m36s)



[gonna grab the link here in just a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m39s)



[second](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m40s)



[showing building out subtitles for this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m41s)



[stream using Azure cognitive services so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m46s)



[if people are interested the the link to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m49s)



[the project is there and let's see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m51s)



[let me find the the video for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m57s)



[effectively part one of this series as](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h00m59s)



[we will dub it copy link please so this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m02s)



[is just basically going to be taking the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m09s)



[existing WPF app that we had started and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m11s)



[building it out a little bit more so I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m14s)



[officially on Christmas vacation and so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m17s)



[naturally what do I do but write more](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m19s)



[code because that is what is awesome so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m21s)



[let's switch over here so this is the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m25s)



[app as we left it before earlier my chat](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m29s)



[box does not show up on the camera mode](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m32s)



[note to self fix that okay so let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m34s)



[let's just make sure we're all still in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m38s)



[a working state so app fires up and do I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m40s)



[believe if everything works according to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m47s)



[plan it just starts working all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m49s)



[okay so we we start talking what's going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h01m55s)



[on here okay now I'm confused there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m00s)



[should have been a start command oh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m06s)



[there it is go button and we should be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m08s)



[going I think maybe there we go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m12s)



[and that shows up there and then hahaha](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m18s)



[streams their text at the bottom and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m22s)



[away we go sweet and it's intelligent](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m25s)



[enough to know how to effectively parse](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m32s)



[that out and and build it out so for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m35s)



[those people who missed it before what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m39s)



[what this app is doing is on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m41s)



[right-hand side we effectively have a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m42s)



[list of the text that's going to be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m44s)



[displayed as your the I should say the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m46s)



[SDK that we're using to interact with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m50s)



[this waits for either a pause or a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m52s)



[certain number of words](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m55s)



[I don't recall which we probably need to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m56s)



[configure it I'm noticing it's letting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m58s)



[me go way too long yeah and so it'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h02m59s)



[build up this list and then effectively](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m04s)



[just start parsing through it one one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m06s)



[line at a time because it knows roughly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m09s)



[how much space it has and so you can see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m13s)



[sort of the delay between when it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m18s)



[updates a backing file that Stream Labs](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m20s)



[is watching and when it actually shows](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m22s)



[up on the screen so lots of stuff to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m26s)



[update because I want to get this app](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m29s)



[actually into a usable state so that I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m30s)



[can keep using it on this stream so half](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m32s)



[of this stream will have subtitles and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m35s)



[the other half won't so and we will go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m37s)



[from there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m41s)



[so I think there's a few things that I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m42s)



[want to deal with initially and some of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m44s)



[it is just the GUI of this to make this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m47s)



[prettier to work with and then there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m50s)



[probably some configuration stuff and I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m52s)



[know I've got a lot of sort of to do's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m54s)



[and things hanging out around here so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h03m57s)



[because they've got all these event](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m01s)



[handlers that we didn't handle before](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m02s)



[and all of that jazz so so the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m04s)



[recognizing stuff and let's pop that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m09s)



[open here real quick yeah so this gets](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m11s)



[kind of interesting because this this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m17s)



[could theoretically show up stuff a lot](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m19s)



[quicker and this might be what we want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m21s)



[to do is start including this text so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m23s)



[that we can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m28s)



[displayed as soon as we hit the maximum](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m30s)



[length rather than waiting for a large](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m32s)



[block of text to start flowing through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m34s)



[because as you can see this as](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m36s)



[recognizing is pretty much filling out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m37s)



[almost word-for-word as it goes across](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m40s)



[and so there might be a little bit of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m42s)



[figuring out what is the the proper way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m45s)



[to handle this because again it can keep](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m47s)



[going there's a I think a limit so there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m50s)



[there let's let's start with that maybe](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m55s)



[so and this is gonna be a little bit of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h04m57s)



[plain because I don't actually know what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m00s)



[is needed here so start with picking on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m03s)



[this I think there was something about](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m07s)



[your property quest word level time](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m12s)



[stamps interesting let's see set proxy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m16s)



[what is one of my options here oh oh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m27s)



[this is no that's not what I want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m32s)



[cool but not what I'm looking for here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m35s)



[ah let's see see property cancellation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m37s)



[reason I am wondering about let's take a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m45s)



[look at this is there anything on here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m50s)



[because I'd like to know when a result](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m54s)



[changes speech recognition result a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h05m58s)



[duration offset result ID so I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m04s)



[curious if I get a different ID because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m08s)



[it would be kind of nice to use this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m10s)



[right so let's see here so let's just do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m12s)



[Bing Bing slap that guy in away we go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m15s)



[and let's fire this off because if all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m22s)



[of the effectively individual events](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m25s)



[come with IDs then that gives us a nice](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m29s)



[easy way of knowing which ones nope](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m33s)



[these are definitely randomly generated](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m36s)



[goods so let's just catch it here on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m38s)



[next one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m40s)



[okay so output window be visible please](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m42s)



[thanks so what do we have do I have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m45s)



[anything because I'm sort of trying to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m48s)



[avoid doing just a text-based search to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m50s)



[know if I need to do more ordering the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m53s)



[property's non-public members I don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h06m59s)



[mind about looking through these not a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m01s)



[lot of stuff nope see so result ID I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m04s)



[almost just need to grab the previous](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m15s)



[text and the duration and just make the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m20s)



[assumption that if the previous text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m22s)



[matches and the duration is longer that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m24s)



[this is a new a new thing right because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m26s)



[the result ID is clearly different on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m30s)



[each pass and there's nothing else](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m32s)



[really in here telling me when this is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m35s)



[done right because ultimately all I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m40s)



[interested in is picking up this text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m43s)



[until it hits the the end so oh let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m46s)



[let's figure out how we're going to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m54s)



[this so recognize so this guy broke it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m56s)



[into lines this guy figured out how to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h07m59s)



[break the individual text into lines but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m03s)



[uh I kind of feel like we just run to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m08s)



[the end](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m13s)



[so subtitle line add this goes into here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m18s)



[so I'm just trying to remind myself of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m22s)



[how this worked again and then something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m25s)



[was pulling it off adds two lines right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m27s)



[subtitles ah so that's how it's working](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m34s)



[oh that's problem so one got a threading](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m37s)



[problem to begin with so let's just fix](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m47s)



[that let's fix that right away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m49s)



[okay so subtitle lines there lock on it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m53s)



[if there are any this guy here must be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h08m57s)



[just in a task yeah so he's in a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m00s)



[long-running task which is effectively](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m03s)



[and or I should say probably a new](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m05s)



[thread said you might drinks down on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m07s)



[right hand side I'm right-handed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m14s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m16s)



[so the question comes how can we break](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m21s)



[this up nicely because ultimately what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m23s)



[we're looking to do is this logic here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m25s)



[right where we write stuff to the disk](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m27s)



[and we effectively just queue it up and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m30s)



[so in here rather than breaking this up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m34s)



[what I want to grab is the new text and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m37s)



[verify that the new text is longer than](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m46s)



[the last bit of text all right because I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m54s)



[effect of Lee just want to start adding](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m56s)



[because this thing just keeps growing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m57s)



[and growing and growing though I am](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h09m59s)



[noticing something it changes yuck so I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m02s)



[can't really rely too much on the last](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m12s)



[word or possibly words because you'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m17s)



[notice it's switched up several times as](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m24s)



[it was figuring out what it was doing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m28s)



[and so it'll go back and change prior](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m32s)



[words so maybe we can't really](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m34s)



[realistically use this let's see e dot](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m37s)



[result what's on here offset in ticks](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m41s)



[okay result reason that was a to do we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m48s)



[had here recognize some keyword](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m53s)



[recognizing speech got it so that's it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h10m56s)



[not really helpful what I'd really like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m02s)



[to do is configure this guy so that it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m04s)



[was let's start with this speech config](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m06s)



[all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m11s)



[because it'd be nice to tell it to stop](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m14s)



[because I know there's a timeout and I'd](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m17s)



[like to be able to control that enable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m21s)



[dictation only supported in speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m24s)



[continuous recognition isn't that what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m29s)



[we want I feel like this is what I want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m34s)



[right enable dictation what's that going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m39s)



[to do so what is there it's our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m42s)



[continuous recognition which is what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m53s)



[we've got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m55s)



[start stop dispose so there's nothing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m56s)



[really here i speech start detected](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h11m59s)



[speech end detected I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m06s)



[wire up the rest of these events for no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m09s)



[other reason other than to log some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m14s)



[output for them so let's hear filter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m16s)



[real quick session started session](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m20s)



[started great so we're just gonna we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m25s)



[gonna debug some of these things because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m29s)



[I don't actually know this API well](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m30s)



[enough to quite know what it's going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m32s)



[do let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m37s)



[prefixing everything this way session](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m44s)



[started session ID](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m48s)



[okay we'll see what that ends up doing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m54s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h12m58s)



[what do you / method group - lambda I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m00s)



[don't understand why it's suggesting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m08s)



[that okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m10s)



[it's an option feel like that I want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m11s)



[have to find the setting to turn that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m16s)



[down I don't want that showing up that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m18s)



[much okay session started so she'd](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m19s)



[stopped great basically this guy here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m23s)



[I'm sort of curious what that enable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m31s)



[dictation is going to do dang it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m34s)



[ctrl-c and ctrl-v are very close to each](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m38s)



[other which is always unfortunate let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m41s)



[see session stopped and what is actually](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m45s)



[on this session ID again great makes it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m51s)



[easy I can write the right line for that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h13m55s)



[speech started detected because what I'd](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m00s)



[really like to know is the difference of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m03s)



[when it's giving me new stuff or when I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m05s)



[can determine that is done changing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m08s)



[things honestly the speech start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m11s)



[detected that's just a session ID sure](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m14s)



[that sounds great each start detected](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m20s)



[I'll just do the offset for fun because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m36s)



[I don't really don't really know what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m39s)



[I'm expecting to get from that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m41s)



[recognizer speech and method great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m43s)



[guessing you're gonna be basically the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m49s)



[same information alright let's see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m52s)



[speech and yep basically the exact same](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h14m56s)



[stuff and I kind of wonder if the two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m04s)



[string on these guys will actually do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m05s)



[something useful too](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m07s)



[mmm look at that so much easier no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m16s)



[thinking involved alright just let the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m26s)



[to string method do what the to string](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m29s)



[method wants great okay so it is worth](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m31s)



[noting that this is technically](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m35s)



[different than explicitly calling to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m37s)



[string it calls the string conversion](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m38s)



[operator which in most cases is going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m43s)



[invoke to string but not guaranteed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m45s)



[let's see here so let's do cancel to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m49s)



[just because I want to see if we're ever](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m53s)



[hitting this so create method canceled](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m56s)



[so what is actually on you air code air](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h15m59s)



[details reason cancellation Outlook this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m02s)



[debug right line will just let this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m07s)



[guy's got a to string on them as well so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m16s)



[we'll just let it go yeah so let's fire](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m18s)



[that off and see what that gets us cuz](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m25s)



[again I'd really like to get it to the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m27s)



[point where I have enough information so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m29s)



[that I can push this stuff up right away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m32s)



[because subtitles that delay behind by](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m36s)



[30 seconds or kind of sucky so let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m38s)



[go testing so we've got a session](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m42s)



[started which makes sense we've got a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m46s)



[bunch of stuff coming into the middle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h16m48s)



[yeah so that's not quite what we want so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m01s)



[it's really only the session started is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m06s)



[only coming through once and then we've](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m08s)



[got a whole bunch of recognition stuff](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m10s)



[coming through she wasn't really what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m11s)



[want yeah you'll notice it started off](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m15s)



[she said she isn't she doesn't and then](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m20s)



[it goes back in corrects which is great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m23s)



[it just means that there's a trade-off](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m24s)



[right and I don't want to just stop when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m28s)



[I get enough text and start dumping that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m34s)



[out because that's probably not what I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m37s)



[want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m39s)



[I wish it capitalized this I too](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m47s)



[yeah that would be a nice hey wait a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m56s)



[minute oh it does it on the final result](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h17m59s)



[oh that's cool that's cool because these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m03s)



[are just showing the intermediate](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m08s)



[results okay so another reason not to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m09s)



[take it dang it is there a way I can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m11s)



[tell it I'm done right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m17s)



[like force force it to recognize speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m23s)



[recognized](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m29s)



[what's signals that the final](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m30s)



[recognition result is retrieved](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m34s)



[I wish there was a way to control this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m47s)



[do a sync recognition I want I want a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m49s)



[way to control how long this thing long](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m54s)



[this thing runs okay where recognizer to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h18m56s)



[do just hoping that there is something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m09s)



[on here it gives me some level of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m15s)



[control recognizer because ultimately](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m18s)



[the clients what's what has to be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m24s)



[determined determining what the max](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m26s)



[length time is right and I'd like it to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m29s)



[push through sooner rather than waiting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m31s)



[for as long as it goes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m36s)



[start continuous so let's look at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m45s)



[transcribe right stop transcribing wait](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h19m50s)



[what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m00s)



[stop transcribing exist but not start no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m00s)



[no no no I know we just saw this let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m06s)



[kill this kill this let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m11s)



[naval dictation so that's just a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m18s)



[property request word level timestamps](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m20s)



[enable audio logging let's look at these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m24s)



[guys there's got to be two twos it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m29s)



[region token type and point host yeah](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m37s)



[there's got to be something around here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m42s)



[voice features intent record mode](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m45s)



[interactive conversation dictate the SDK](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m54s)



[uses it internally okay kind of want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h20m59s)



[find usages of this guy so we're just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m06s)



[going to mark him so one of my favorite](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m08s)



[features is these bookmarks for when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m12s)



[you're digging through code and you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m13s)



[realize oh shoot I want to come back to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m15s)



[that later](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m16s)



[ctrl KK is the default keyboard shortcut](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m17s)



[enable silence timeout yeah this is what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m21s)



[I want that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m27s)



[initial silence timeout](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m32s)



[yeah I want I want to control these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m35s)



[enable audio logging great profanity](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m38s)



[filter don't really care output format](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m46s)



[quest stable partial result oh this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m52s)



[could be this this could be nice if the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h21m59s)



[partial result was stable I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m02s)



[this means it doesn't do it only sends](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m04s)



[back when it's confident of what it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m06s)



[actually transcribed great audio input](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m07s)



[received by the SDK in the mouth so to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m17s)



[do 2k maybe speech log file named like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m22s)



[type from ID](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m30s)



[hmm okay so let's let's go back through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m40s)



[some of these so record mode who plays](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m43s)



[with this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m47s)



[show me usages interesting not set](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m48s)



[directly okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m51s)



[and silence timeout initial silence](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m54s)



[timeout okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h22m58s)



[my present for stabilized entry well](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m11s)



[let's try it let's try turning this on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m14s)



[real quick right so config set property](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m15s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m22s)



[property ID boom and it wants a bool I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m23s)



[believe is what it said so how about](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m30s)



[bool true string may be changes made Oh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m33s)



[fine we got to recover because I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m41s)



[curious if this gives me if this has the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m44s)



[recognizing bits then be stable that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m46s)



[might make them useful for showing the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m49s)



[subtitles okay so here we go again let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m51s)



[see what this actually gives us okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h23m54s)



[that's a little bit better that means](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m00s)



[that it is actually going through and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m02s)



[doing changes I want this to work](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m04s)



[there is there is still a difference in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m12s)



[like I'm noticing the capitalization and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m15s)



[a few things there that aren't quite the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m18s)



[same](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m20s)



[okay let's that doesn't quite give me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m24s)



[what I want it does mean that yeah it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m29s)



[still changing some of the stuff on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m36s)



[end so it's not it doesn't work the way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m37s)



[I would expect it can be interactive](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m40s)



[conversation dictation so let's real](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m43s)



[quick when we config enable dictation is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m48s)



[that just setting that property is that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m53s)



[all that's doing yeah so it's just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m55s)



[setting this to dictation so we can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h24m58s)



[actually change this up right can be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m02s)



[interactive or dictation we know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m05s)



[dictation ain't quite give us what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m09s)



[wanted I don't know what it defaults to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m10s)



[that might be a fun one to play with and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m13s)



[silence timeout milliseconds](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m18s)



[I thought](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m25s)



[it's just real quick look for max](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m29s)



[because a speech service](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m30s)



[we're level time stamps has to be in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m43s)



[partial results to be returned](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m47s)



[that's what okay that's a little](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m51s)



[different I don't think we want the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m54s)



[partial](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h25m57s)



[loud values are true text okay that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m03s)



[not a lot of options it's just so many](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m12s)



[weather code word level timestamps in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m19s)



[the response result okay I don't know if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m21s)



[that's really what I'm after see a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m29s)



[string value specifying the output](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m32s)



[format kind I just want to look at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m34s)



[time stamps because what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m38s)



[is the the time stamp for how long it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m40s)



[needs because there is a max length at a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m44s)



[certain point it'll just say I've got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m47s)



[enough audio I'm I'm shipping this up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m49s)



[right recognition latency milliseconds](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h26m51s)



[but as received by this DK and the final](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m00s)



[result is received from the service](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m02s)



[okay I don't really care about that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m10s)



[silence timeout for listening all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m16s)



[so we could change the silence timeout](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m19s)



[so this is pts as it's known in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m31s)



[video community conversation transcribed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m35s)



[service so I'm wondering if okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m43s)



[hypothetical here real quick right let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m49s)



[see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m52s)



[navigate optic browser because i'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m53s)



[wondering if there's a different config](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m57s)



[in here fan of the options properties](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h27m59s)



[results speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m13s)



[sort of wonder if I if I change that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m30s)



[over to detailed what I get I don't know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m33s)



[what the default is speech synthesis](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m37s)



[results](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m41s)



[or level timing results](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m49s)



[raceless grammar](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h28m59s)



[got it not exactly what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m06s)



[that's all that's in here from oh wait](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m11s)



[wait wait wait wait wait](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m14s)



[transcription conversation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m16s)



[transcribed I'm wondering if this might](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m26s)

[what's in an audio config from default](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m43s)



[microphone input from stray okay I could](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m48s)



[get on board with this because this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m54s)



[could be interesting for our the cases](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m55s)



[where I'm streaming with somebody else](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h29m59s)

[back what I want is conversation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m14s)



[transcription event arcs boom event](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m18s)



[results here user ID](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m24s)



[what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m33s)

[just says who is speaking not what was](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m39s)



[said conversation transcription event](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m44s)



[args](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h30m50s)



[so you add participants conversation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m00s)



[remove participants](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m03s)



[do you drive you derive from wrecking](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m13s)



[okay got it so you derive from](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m16s)



[recognizer which is going to have the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m19s)



[same type of stuff on there not quite](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m20s)



[what we were looking for speech dialogue](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m28s)



[not quite what we're hunting for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m34s)



[internal stuff intent not quite what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m36s)



[want I'm really disappointed that this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m44s)



[doesn't have a little more detail here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m47s)



[maybe the expectation is you use these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m51s)



[in conjunction with speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h31m53s)



[format](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m02s)



[doesn't seem like there's that much](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m05s)



[useful stuff for what I want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m09s)



[speech recognition result extensions](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m16s)



[best what does this do turns the best](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m18s)



[possible recognitions for the result the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m23s)



[recognizer was created with detailed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m26s)



[output format oh ok so let's let's give](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m28s)



[that a try](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m35s)



[so let's see so is it in the config](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m36s)



[where I set output format yeah let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m40s)



[detailed alright and let's just see what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m43s)



[let's just see what comes through from](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m46s)



[this because if this will give me more](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m48s)



[information maybe we can then use that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m53s)



[so ok that's nice and wonderful](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h32m55s)



[I'm wondering if there's more](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m05s)



[information inside of this guy that I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m06s)



[missing so what else are what else is on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m09s)



[you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m12s)



[recognition results or a reason reason](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m18s)



[ID text was this best thing on speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m21s)



[recognition result best ok so that must](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m27s)



[mean that there's extra stuff and maybe](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m34s)



[the properties](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m36s)



[let's see u dot result nest first or](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m38s)



[default right cf9 barbed best result](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m49s)



[because I assume these things would be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h33m59s)



[ordered out hope maybe possibly and what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m01s)



[are you best result confidence lexical](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m08s)



[form oh wow oh wow so there's a lot here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m13s)



[ok so I kind of want to grab it here and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m22s)



[then I kind of want to grab it here and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m25s)



[I just kind of want to let this thing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m30s)



[run for a second and then set some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m32s)



[breakpoints and see what's exactly on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m33s)



[these guys](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m35s)



[okay so here we go we're gonna get this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m42s)



[guy running and then see let's grab it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m45s)



[here first](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m48s)



[so let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m56s)



[text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h34m59s)



[normalized form mass normalized form](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m03s)



[lexical form fairly confident okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m07s)



[that got me that and where did it come](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m13s)



[from](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m21s)



[I guess it's my first thought because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m22s)



[that was](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m25s)



[let's see state 4](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m33s)



[I'm a little curious where this is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m39s)



[coming from right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m45s)



[there's all this magical pointer II](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m51s)



[stuff hiding in here SPX factory what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m53s)



[the heck why do we have so much stuff so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h35m57s)



[it's marshalling okay that doesn't leave](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m04s)



[me with a lot of a lot of warm fuzzies](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m11s)



[because this guy clearly has who](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m15s)



[recognized text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m19s)



[so hold on let's the immediate window](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m25s)



[you know to string let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m30s)



[this guy real quick so that has a bunch](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m33s)



[of data on it so what's the difference](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m39s)



[between this and this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m47s)



[nothing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h36m56s)



[so I mean I am a mildly curious how many](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m01s)



[to list how many are there oh wow okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m06s)



[let's look at the next one then let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m12s)



[see so it's slightly less confident](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m17s)



[about that oh wow so it's actually](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m20s)



[sending back quite a bit of data hmm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m21s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m27s)



[so let's let it run so what did this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m28s)



[come back as no so I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m31s)



[break here well let's do this real quick](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m35s)



[so if best results not null let's take a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m39s)



[quick look at what's actually in here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m46s)



[right because I'm curious if this can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m50s)



[only be used on the final results or on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m56s)



[the intermediate results because that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h37m58s)



[would be more interesting and it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m01s)



[looking like it's only available on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m03s)



[final result bummer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m06s)



[okay so I really want to just figure out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m14s)



[how I can turn this thing down so I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m16s)



[don't know if I actually care to get the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m19s)



[detailed output we're gonna leave it on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m21s)



[for now stable partial result I don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m22s)



[know if this makes a big difference so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m31s)



[let's let's look at the other properties](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m32s)



[we can set so property ID](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m34s)



[speech sessionid](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m45s)



[speech service initial silence timeout](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h38m51s)



[language understanding region great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m03s)



[initial silence the initial silence](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m05s)



[timeout value in milliseconds](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m08s)



[Kord mode let's see so let's do we've](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m15s)



[already tried dictation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m21s)



[let's try interactive alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m22s)



[and let's see if this changes up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m31s)



[anything](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m34s)



[ooh exception with an air code](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m41s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m50s)



[the exception was originally thrown at](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m55s)



[this call stack switch mode not allowed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h39m57s)



[okay so apparently setting this well we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m07s)



[know enable dictation worked right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m12s)



[let's just make darn sure I didn't yeah](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m14s)



[so that okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m25s)



[no dictation should work so let's try](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m27s)



[conversation I'm guessing that this is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m33s)



[probably gonna throw the same exception](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m36s)



[only because we saw that conversation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m39s)



[API oh maybe not Marrissa tation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m41s)



[conversation api well it does seem to be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m48s)



[a little quicker I guess but I if I keep](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m54s)



[going ice probably just get this thing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m56s)



[to block up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h40m59s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m04s)



[well well well well well so how are we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m13s)



[going to go about this so this this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m16s)



[doesn't appear to give us quite what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m18s)



[need so back to the drawing board](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m20s)



[outputs and voice](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m37s)



[and silence timeout so if we set the end](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m49s)



[silence timeout in milliseconds I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m53s)



[guessing it once I'll set property](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m55s)



[Tate's a string so let's set it to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h41m58s)



[something insane like 10 and see if just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m01s)



[the the mild pauses if that'll be good](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m10s)



[enough because this might get us all the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m12s)



[way to what we want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m16s)



[Wow that seems a little too fast](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m23s)



[okay so clearly that's that's working](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m32s)



[it's just not the way quite what we want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m36s)



[and it would be nice if it would I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m40s)



[suppose what we could do is we could](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m45s)



[watch the other one and then just simply](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m47s)



[lower the time out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m56s)



[well you can't it doesn't allow you to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h42m58s)



[change it mid-flight](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m00s)



[okay I wonder does this have a get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m06s)



[property I'm curious what the default is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m10s)



[get property so what are you default to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m13s)



[sort of curious what this is before I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m18s)



[get to all right because I'm changing it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m27s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m31s)



[so what exactly is this value](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m34s)



[if we fire this up default is empty](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m43s)



[string not helpful not helpful Mabel](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m46s)



[audio login let's see so we set initial](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h43m56s)



[silenced value](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m04s)



[to request a partial results by omitting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m13s)



[words in the end](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m16s)



[do some results](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m30s)



[yeah I'm guessing it has to be one of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m47s)



[these speech ones](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m49s)



[I was probably this should be used by](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m55s)



[the service yeah yeah and a filter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m56s)



[true/false detailed best detailed result](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h44m59s)



[so you probably don't need to set this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m11s)



[because our output mode is probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m13s)



[trained that on specify where their](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m14s)



[audio logging is enabled in the service](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m19s)



[and silence timeout](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m20s)



[with voice and language speech sessionid](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m29s)



[language in 10th region all right we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m33s)



[already set those translation voice](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m38s)



[a bunch of proxies and points token](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m45s)



[authorization types it doesn't look like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m49s)



[there's a good option so short version](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m55s)



[is a hundreds too fast I'll put up to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h45m58s)



[200 so I'm a little less concerned about](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m00s)



[do I care about grabbing it because I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m06s)



[can't decide if I like the idea of just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m10s)



[grabbing a mid-flight like this and not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m12s)



[letting it go through and deal with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m17s)



[sentence breaks see that's the other](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m19s)



[problem is setting this clearly messes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m25s)



[it up okay I've decided I don't care](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m28s)



[that much I care a little bit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m33s)



[let's turn it up I mmm I don't like this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m40s)



[already really don't like this okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m45s)



[let's see how that does that seems like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m49s)



[it might be a better I feel like it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h46m55s)



[seems like it's missing words in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m01s)



[moment where it switches between waiting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m03s)



[for the pause and starting back up again](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m07s)



[like there's a little bit of a break in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m08s)



[the middle yeah mmm okay fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m10s)



[turn it off turn it off not going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m19s)



[deal with it not going to deal with it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m25s)



[okay sue the question now now becomes am](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m28s)



[i okay with doing this with the partial](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m35s)



[results right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m43s)



[because I do still have the digital](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m45s)



[where is it reckon it's cancelled and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m48s)



[session started this guy here right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m51s)



[recognizing event handler so there is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h47m54s)



[the concept of being able to utilize](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m01s)



[that the problem being is that there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m02s)



[not a great way of breaking it into its](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m07s)



[component parts](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m12s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m18s)



[yeah yeah kiyow kiyow kiyow kiyow kiyow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m20s)



[I'm glad to know I was able to figure](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m28s)



[that one out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m29s)



[and I like the formatting idea okay fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m34s)



[I'm just gonna give up on this for now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m37s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m39s)



[back to what I was initially planning on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m40s)



[doing with all of this is actually](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m42s)



[getting this to the point where we can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m44s)



[use it all right because this is very](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m45s)



[much tied to the end so let's go through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m48s)



[and maybe pretty this up and get this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m53s)



[into something that I can actually use](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m56s)



[in a reasonable manner so this is only](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h48m58s)



[here for the right because if we drop](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m03s)



[the reference it goes away okey](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m06s)



[okay okay okay so let's let's start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m11s)



[making this a little bit more production](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m14s)



[production ready or at least my](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m16s)



[definition production ready so step one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m19s)



[it looks ugly so material design to the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m21s)



[rescue okay so we're just gonna grab](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m28s)



[this grab this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m31s)



[I'm tolerant to pre-releases so we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m35s)



[just going to grab this and this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m37s)



[should work there is a bug in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m39s)



[material design three oh release be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m41s)



[aware where it doesn't properly pull in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m43s)



[the colors library and so you'll get a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m45s)



[crash saying hey couldn't find it don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m48s)



[know what to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m51s)



[so yeah the fix is to either grab the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m53s)



[latest pre-release or manually install](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h49m56s)



[the colors library those are the two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m01s)



[choices](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m06s)



[okay so wikipage getting started and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m07s)



[we're just gonna come down here and grab](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m12s)



[some stuff so this sounds good](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m13s)



[this sounds good great great great so on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m17s)



[my app dot saml actually I guess I could](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m21s)



[just copy the whole resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m25s)



[line couldn't I just do that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m27s)



[rather than typing so go ahead Auto code](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m30s)



[there I think I'm gonna go dark theme on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m34s)



[this and I think the primary color of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m38s)



[like a teal maybe and a secondary color](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m42s)



[of purple might look a little nicer I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m46s)



[think that's kind of closer now I have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m51s)



[stream lab setup anyway so maybe](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m54s)



[something akin to that okay so next](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m56s)



[thing we need see this guy down here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h50m59s)



[come down here we probably just want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m08s)



[pick up all of this stuff for the window](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m11s)



[right so we come down here and main](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m14s)



[window boom alright so there's all that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m17s)



[relaunch be pretty](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m22s)



[uh-oh okay so that air there was saying](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m32s)



[it couldn't find the dangnabbit I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m37s)



[I just exposed my key again wale getting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m42s)



[really good at cycling these keys](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m47s)



[oh no moment secrets turn that off](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m49s)



[let's see regen key yes please copy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h51m54s)



[let's see here and it did at the tip](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m03s)



[paste the new key in at some point I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m09s)



[gonna stop encoding it right here and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m13s)



[actually put it my environment variable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m15s)



[so that stops happening that would be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m17s)



[great if it would stop doing that so you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m19s)



[turn that off turn that off okay back to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m21s)



[coding mode it is interesting it's also](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m25s)



[not clearing this file I should fix that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m30s)



[that's why the subtitles stuck at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m33s)



[bottom so for those people who think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m35s)



[it's broken](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m37s)



[nope it's just because this isn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m37s)



[working correctly so let's first fix](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m39s)



[this so whenever you edit something in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m42s)



[the property GUI](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m45s)



[in Visual Studio it likes to do this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m47s)



[because the that GUI was written before](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m50s)



[this SDK project stuff was around it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m53s)



[hasn't fully been updated because most](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m57s)



[of the time when I see this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h52m59s)



[configuration pipe platform in here it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m00s)



[was a mistake and what you really meant](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m02s)



[to do is apply it to all configurations](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m04s)



[on all platforms right so in this case](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m06s)



[that's what we want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m11s)



[three-one this guy is unhappy because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m12s)



[apparently when you download the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m17s)



[pre-release of the manage new key](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m19s)



[packages that's what we're after when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m23s)



[you download the pre-release of this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m25s)



[it doesn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m27s)



[material design themes this guy here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m31s)



[show me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m35s)



[3:01 interesting so it thinks that it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m37s)



[wants one two two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m45s)



[huh now I'm trying to decide if I like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m54s)



[that or not I know why it so the reason](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h53m57s)



[why it's happening is because in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m00s)



[azure pipeline that compiles these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m02s)



[libraries these have both been revved](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m03s)



[the next version the thing is this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m06s)



[there is no changes in the colors](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m09s)



[library that this thing needs it's only](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m11s)



[squawking because of the version bit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m12s)



[interesting I don't know if there's a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m19s)



[great solution aside from making my](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m23s)



[build system smart about what changes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m26s)



[went into it don't know if I like that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m29s)



[yeah yuck whatever okay we'll just make](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m34s)



[it work Auto reference in the version](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m39s)



[that it wants we'll get around the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m42s)



[problem okay so that gets us going we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m43s)



[hit start we got to get some indication](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m46s)



[of whether we're running or not because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m49s)



[this is getting an obnoxious alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m50s)



[okay so text is there this is going cool](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h54m55s)



[I mean that gets gets us closer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m01s)



[a little bit closer okay and so let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m06s)



[back over here so this guy here step 1](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m11s)



[this needs to be a toggle button alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m14s)



[because I don't want it to just be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m15s)



[starts always I wanted to be start and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m17s)



[then stop and I want it to change](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m21s)



[accordingly so step one we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m23s)



[stylize this guy out so toggle button](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m27s)



[style style target type toggle button](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m34s)



[based on static resource X type toggle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m41s)



[button okay so this is probably one of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m48s)



[the most common things I see happen when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m50s)



[people use a theme in library is they'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m52s)



[set a style they'll forget to set the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m54s)



[based on and your new style will](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m56s)



[override everything from the theme](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h55m59s)



[library so this just says base this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m00s)



[style think of polymorphism with a base](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m03s)



[class on the style whose key is toggle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m05s)



[button ie the implicit style for toggle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m12s)



[button which is what we want here so we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m15s)



[are going to do a setter and I cannot](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m17s)



[type set our property content value](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m21s)



[start right okay and so we're gonna take](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m26s)



[this guy out there is a there is a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m31s)



[reason why I'm doing this because we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m33s)



[gonna set up a trigger here in a minute](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m35s)



[set our property command value binding](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m36s)



[start command okay so now you are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m43s)



[meaningless okay I think that gets us a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m48s)



[little bit closer okay now let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m53s)



[style triggers data trigger binding this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h56m58s)



[is where I want to go and check our view](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m06s)



[model did we expose this we did not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m07s)



[public please finding recognizer right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m11s)



[so then we're going to take these styles](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m17s)



[here put them here so we're going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m19s)



[compare this value against null and then](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m24s)



[for the not know case we're gonna set it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m30s)



[up here so something likes stop stop](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m32s)



[command](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m39s)



[so basically toggling the presence of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m40s)



[the recognizer property is going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m43s)



[change up what this button says which I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m45s)



[thinks is closer to what we want I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m48s)



[a big fan of this so there's a couple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m50s)



[things we gotta gotta clean this guy up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m53s)



[a little bit so let's see here private](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h57m56s)



[speech recognizer okay man I cannot type](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m03s)



[tonight I think that's my keyboard I'd](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m11s)



[like to blame the keyboard it's probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m14s)



[me yeah we'll fix the problem](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m16s)



[Mountain Dew there problem solved okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m19s)



[so let's do recognizer there and do we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m27s)



[have yes we do have a material design](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m32s)



[set up so I night but I think what I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m35s)



[want think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m38s)



[so if set breath recognizer and value so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m43s)



[if the value changes we're gonna do some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m49s)



[fun stuff so our original value so grab](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m52s)



[the value if we get a new value we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h58m59s)



[clean this guy up so original value know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m02s)



[propagation and dispose right so if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m08s)



[somebody swaps out the value on us we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m13s)



[go ahead and clean that guy up great so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m16s)



[I think this guy becomes recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m19s)



[dispose actually am I saying recognize](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m23s)



[it gets null](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m31s)



[right just know it out do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m32s)



[we've got null checks turned on and we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m37s)



[want knoll to be a valid value all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m41s)



[because we want to be able to let this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m44s)



[thing start as null and then change to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m46s)



[null that guy needs to be null - okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m48s)



[that handles that that somewhat cleans](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m52s)



[up our start-stop operations at some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m55s)



[point we got to deal with this guy I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=00h59m58s)



[don't know if I was me I call those](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m01s)



[event handlers split text based on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m05s)



[length this doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m08s)



[we're already splitting the text based](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m10s)



[on length this has a font size probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m12s)



[want to clean some of this stuff up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m16s)



[right because this font here is not the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m19s)



[font inside of the app this is the font](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m24s)



[used by stream labs to render it at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m25s)



[bottom there so that matters](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m29s)



[let's see to do don't put a space at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m31s)



[beginning else we are pre fixing it mmm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m34s)



[yuck](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m37s)



[is this really that hard to do if index](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m44s)



[greater than zero don't know why we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m51s)



[didn't do that beat to begin with okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m54s)



[their space problem solved okay so that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h00m59s)



[handles that that handles that we can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m04s)



[now start stop we got a little bit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m07s)



[better display I think I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m09s)



[show I think I want to show this in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m13s)



[process stuff right so let's see what do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m18s)



[we got what do we got for layout over](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m22s)



[here so scroll viewer with an items](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m23s)



[control okay two rows I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m26s)



[maybe we do something a little more](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m33s)



[interesting here right where we show the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m36s)



[text that's being processed and on the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m41s)



[fly let's see so you guys here and let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m44s)



[see grid row definitions maybe the first](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m49s)



[row fill all the space next row](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h01m57s)



[height:auto](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m01s)



[and I think what I'm gonna do text block](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m02s)



[text binding current text because really](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m07s)



[what I want to do is when we're showing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m15s)



[these subtitles here I want something to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m16s)



[show the basically the same information](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m19s)



[from the output window I want to be able](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m22s)



[to go through and grab this sort of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m24s)



[transient text or what do they call it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m27s)



[here so from the cognitive stuff](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m29s)



[recognize text recognition text naming](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m34s)



[things is hard](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m38s)



[now recognized text has the wrong](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m43s)



[implication it makes it sound like it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m45s)



[already been parsed did I think I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h02m47s)



[what we do is leave it for the moment](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m01s)



[come back to it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m06s)



[let's see grid Row one grade and then I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m07s)



[think what we're gonna do is we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m10s)



[set an opacity here just so that it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m11s)



[shows a little bit more faded out and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m14s)



[then text wrapping wrap all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m16s)



[because we want this as it gets bigger](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m22s)



[to grow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m24s)



[how about ending text that don't love it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m26s)



[but I like it more than what I was](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m31s)



[thinking of before so let's see here so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m32s)



[private string ending text okay you know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m36s)



[what I should really just go and get my](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m41s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m48s)



[public string ending text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h03m52s)



[and then set will call into the mvvm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m02s)



[light set method so that it handles](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m08s)

[me thanks that guy go let that guy go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m14s)



[okay so there's pending text I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m20s)



[what we're going to come down here is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m22s)



[we're going to just get rid of this cuz](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m25s)



[I don't think I need it and I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m27s)



[set pending text to e dot results](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m29s)



[text yeah that way we can see it as it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h04m40s)

[yuck oh we got to fix this I forgot that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m00s)



[the default button is to actually go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m04s)



[through and show as a toggle switch](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m09s)



[we'll change that but this is at least](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m12s)



[showing stuff on the fly so you get some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m16s)



[sort of progress indicator not sure I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m18s)



[like okay so a couple things are going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m23s)



[to change real quick so scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m25s)



[vertical scroll bar visibility auto](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m28s)



[right so hide the scroll we don't I the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m31s)



[odds of this thing filling all the way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m35s)



[up to where we need a scroll view are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m37s)



[pretty low right so let's go grab the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m38s)



[material design demo app whoa holy cow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m43s)



[middle click that fast okay so back way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m49s)



[too many things open way too many things](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h05m57s)

[playing with font stuff but what we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m16s)



[interested in is toggle buttons buttons](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m18s)



[with progress popup box or are the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m20s)

[there's a there's a default toggle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m36s)



[button let's see it must be under](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m38s)



[toggles maybe let's see toggles](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m41s)

[that's bad just click this button and go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h06m57s)



[straight up here now let's see action](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m00s)



[toggle button alright this looks like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m04s)



[what I want let's see - - so I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m08s)



[action toggle button is exactly what I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m18s)



[want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m22s)



[so this guy so you keep you around for a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m22s)



[moment might need you later](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m29s)



[so rather than basing it on the default](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m30s)



[one we're gonna base it on this one and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m32s)



[nope that ain't it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m40s)



[maybe we don't have one me so let's just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m47s)



[go through this real quick to switch](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m52s)



[toggle button flat primary toggle button](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h07m57s)



[what's this one what's this one do paste](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m04s)



[not quite what I was looking for good](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m14s)



[news is it looks like starting stop work](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m18s)



[on stop we should probably clear this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m19s)



[though so let's fix that real quick so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m22s)



[on stop we should pending tech should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m26s)



[get an old out so that it doesn't just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m33s)



[hang there and displayed line I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m37s)



[leave untouched only because that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m42s)



[background thread will go through and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m45s)



[clean it up so where were we let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m47s)



[back here switch toggle button we don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m49s)



[want the switch let's see I really just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m53s)



[want a button oh okay I'm an idiot I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h08m59s)



[really just want a button right right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m08s)



[let's change this guy here to X type](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m18s)



[button target type button and then you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m22s)



[become button and relaunch so I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m30s)



[that probably confused it there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m35s)



[that's alright stop you should probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m39s)



[set a minimum width on this or something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m43s)



[all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m45s)



[well that ain't bad hmm feels a little](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m48s)



[choppy like this and that is not turn](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h09m54s)



[you down a little bit more because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m01s)



[that's not obviously faded and I can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m03s)



[even go lower I think it's just the dark](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m08s)



[theme with the white text on top of it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m11s)



[it makes it really really obvious I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m14s)



[wondering if we change up the font size](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m19s)



[of these guys in here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m21s)



[let's see text the text element font](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m24s)



[size and what is this is set to so 14 is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m33s)



[the default make you a little bigger](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m36s)



[wonder if that is so that makes it a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m40s)



[little nicer right there that's that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m42s)



[at least displaying something reasonable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m47s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m51s)



[think what we do is we add just a wee](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m53s)



[bit of margin around this guy so don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h10m56s)



[care about the left and the right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m01s)



[probably about like I don't know seven](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m02s)



[or eight on the vertical just so that as](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m06s)



[it goes all the way across that button](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m09s)



[doesn't get the text just sitting right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m12s)



[on top of it and I kind of almost want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m14s)



[to set a little I might actually even](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m16s)



[set so let's just do 8 on the top to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m20s)



[separate it from the scroll viewer right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m24s)



[above it and then let's do do like four](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m27s)



[and eight here right just just to get it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m35s)



[off of the edges because there's there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m37s)



[something to be said about not having it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m39s)



[sit right on top of the edges because I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m41s)



[think this guy here what we're going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m44s)



[do is let's just do a margin of eight](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m46s)



[all the way around it's a little harder](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m48s)



[for this one to get right up on the edge](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m51s)



[but at least then if it does it lands a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m53s)



[little nicer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m57s)



[I almost wonder - it'd be nice if I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h11m59s)



[could see the separator of where it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m04s)



[gonna post stuff out oh sure let's just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m05s)



[do that real quick so let's see items](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m10s)



[control item to item](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m14s)



[um](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m19s)



[late data template it's just a string so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m21s)



[I'm not gonna stress too much about a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m28s)



[text blog let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m30s)



[binding directly into it right so this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m36s)



[should still look the same](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m39s)



[okay so that's pretty much what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m42s)



[expect](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m44s)



[but let's maybe a stackpanel](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m45s)



[actually let's just wrap it in a boarder](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m55s)



[I guess alright well and then border](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h12m57s)



[thickness we're gonna do 0 except for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m03s)



[the bottom](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m06s)



[I'll just throw one in there border](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m06s)



[brush I kind of want to grab a theme](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m09s)



[brush real quick that's something I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m12s)



[wondering if maybe we should put in this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m14s)



[tool as something that shows all of the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m16s)



[brushes that might not be bad](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m18s)



[I'm thinking maybe accent color perhaps](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m24s)



[let's let's see here so do to come back](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m28s)



[up to the top](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m33s)



[Wiki and there is a list of the brushes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m35s)



[brush names so let's grab secondary hue](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m39s)



[light should probably change this from](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m45s)



[accent to secondary let's just edit that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m51s)



[we're already in here let's see rather](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m54s)



[than accent](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h13m57s)



[secondary so and for anybody who plays](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m01s)



[around with the material design library](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m04s)



[let me encourage you if you see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m06s)



[something in the wiki that needs editing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m07s)



[just go ahead and edit it it's fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m08s)



[everyone has access I always go back and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m10s)



[review the changes and it itself is a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m14s)



[the wiki's are a git repo so it's not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m18s)



[that big of a deal if something goes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m21s)



[wrong I can always revert it okay hmm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m23s)



[little splash of purple little splash of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m32s)



[purple not sure how well I like it but I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m35s)



[like it better than I don't like it so I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m40s)



[think we're gonna go with it for now and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m42s)



[I think let's just do a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m46s)



[margin on each of these items just just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m48s)



[to give a little bit of separation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m52s)



[between each of them so that there's a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m53s)



[little bit of a separator that looks a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m56s)



[little nicer ya know maybe let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h14m57s)



[actually move this margin down well no I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m02s)



[kind of like it there I was just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m06s)



[thinking that maybe get the text a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m08s)



[little bit off the line but I kind of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m10s)



[like how it looks like these things are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m11s)



[lined up nicely might go a little bigger](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m12s)



[just it just a hair I'm not much of a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m15s)



[designer but I'm gonna be the one who](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m17s)



[has to look at this boom so it broke it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m19s)



[up into lines everything displays nicely](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m23s)



[beautiful beautiful beautiful](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m26s)



[I like it I like it I like it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m32s)



[okay so that's popping things off](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m40s)



[pushing things on writing the file](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m42s)



[great-great-great-great-great we've got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m45s)



[something down here to indicate that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m48s)



[we're running I almost want to put](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m49s)



[something down there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m51s)



[while we're running does it matter I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m53s)



[mean just talking into the mic is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m57s)



[probably good enough right maybe oh I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h15m59s)



[know what we'll do I know what we'll do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m06s)



[I got it I got it I got it here's what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m08s)



[we'll do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m12s)



[let's see textblock boom alright so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m14s)



[let's see style target text block based](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m19s)



[on static resource next type text block](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m25s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m31s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m36s)



[triggers okay so multi data trigger](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m38s)



[multi data triggered conditions it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m45s)



[just gonna be way bigger than it needs](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m49s)



[to be but why not so binding the first](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m51s)



[binding will be for when recognizer is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m54s)



[null right so if recognizer is null yeah](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h16m57s)



[okay so that it continues already giving](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m05s)



[up on this so excellent](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m08s)



[what are you squawking about oh I didn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m10s)



[actually assign you correctly a text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m13s)



[block style](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m16s)



[all right so we'll embed this guy inside](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m19s)



[of the style tag boom all right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m21s)



[there's condition so when that's null](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m26s)



[and when the pending text is also no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m28s)



[it's worth knowing empty string](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m33s)



[technically would cause a problem here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m34s)



[but we're knowing this out inside of the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m36s)



[view model Oh so we should should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m39s)



[this noble right boom boom we got a turn](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m43s)



[on nullable warnings so this guy here I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m47s)



[guess we shouldn't be doing that unless](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h17m54s)



[what's he forcing me to set it no - okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m00s)



[getting a little annoyed with this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m05s)



[change naming rule](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m08s)



[stop whining at me it is perfectly valid](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m10s)



[fact that's my preference okay I know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m15s)



[some people will look at that and go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m20s)



[you're crazy that's my preference deal](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m21s)



[with it okay so we got that we got that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m24s)



[so in the case where this trigger is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m29s)



[true what we will do is we will set the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m31s)



[text text value listening dot okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m34s)



[who interesting I sort of expected it to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m56s)



[default into there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h18m58s)



[a little concerned](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m03s)



[Oh interesting so we should probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m10s)



[have this clear out after it's been set](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m12s)



[so let's let's do that real quick so on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m15s)



[this guy here let's see here so pending](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m20s)



[pending text goes to null boom alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m25s)



[so that gives us a little better there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m32s)



[mmm I don't like how it's not showing up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m37s)



[here I anticipated needing to set](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m41s)



[something mmm not working don't like it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m47s)



[when it doesn't work don't like not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m56s)



[knowing why so let's take a look and see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h19m57s)



[like what cannot find presentation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m03s)



[source](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m05s)



[huh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m11s)



[that's interesting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m17s)



[couldn't find the current application of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m31s)



[interesting I know snoop works with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m36s)



[that's Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m44s)



[interesting there is there is something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h20m57s)



[up with this and I don't know what it is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m01s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m05s)



[just do two - lets see recognize our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m08s)



[value null pending text value null so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m14s)



[let's check here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m18s)



[so just verify that these two getters](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m21s)



[get invoked right out the gate](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m29s)



[because I'll expect this to get called](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m34s)



[by that no no no no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m36s)



[both of those are no y-you know set text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m46s)



[ah because this this guy gets to win out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h21m57s)



[got it actually give me that binding](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m02s)



[back so the reason the triggers weren't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m05s)



[firing is they were firing just fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m09s)



[but because there was an explicit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m11s)



[property setter directly on the text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m12s)



[property](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m15s)



[well that wins because it is closer to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m15s)



[the element than the style so let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m19s)



[setter property text value poof because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m23s)



[in reality we want this to be a not null](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m35s)



[check right we want to only do this when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m36s)



[there is a recognizer and the pending](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m39s)



[text is on set see this is what I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m41s)



[expected to see listening listening and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m44s)



[then it goes to start and it goes away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m47s)



[just so that there's something else](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m48s)



[there okay so let's let's clean that up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m52s)



[then right because we want this guy to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m57s)



[be a not null check not an is null check](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h22m59s)



[I think the easiest thing is just a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m01s)



[value converter I think that's true](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m04s)



[right so let's see so let's just do that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m09s)



[real quick so add new class is null vert](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m15s)



[er CI value converter implement boom so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m25s)



[we're only gonna go one way return value](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m33s)



[is null great so here we'll go window](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m37s)



[resources is a null converter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m49s)



[boom](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h23m56s)



[and technically we should probably do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m05s)



[something with pending text for like is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m07s)



[null or empty or whatever but whatever](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m09s)



[that I know we're knowing in the view](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m11s)



[model so I'm less concerned about it at](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m14s)



[the moment](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m15s)



[well okay so his null should be false we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m18s)



[only want it on an instance and then](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m26s)



[we'll do the comparison so no text text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m28s)



[and then I start talking and it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m38s)



[disappears boof just like magic](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m40s)



[sweet we have subtitles and in the app](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m49s)



[doesn't look horribly ugly okay I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m53s)



[I want to set let's do a min width on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h24m57s)



[this guy of like 120 maybe it's not a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m02s)



[little too long yeah nice and big easy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m06s)



[to hit that should hopefully clean that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m09s)



[up so we have subtitles and they work](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m12s)



[okay before we get too carried away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m20s)



[let's just check this in so stage all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m24s)



[changes getting teeming working all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m29s)



[right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m36s)



[she seems fine all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m42s)



[do okay so commit push the way we go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m48s)



[right so for anyone who's interested](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h25m57s)



[there's the repo okay so that gets us](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m03s)



[there now the next question is where to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m08s)



[go from here tempted to go down the path](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m10s)



[of like unit testing I know I've already](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m13s)



[been bad on like test-driven development](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m16s)



[not written in E but I feel like I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m18s)



[getting to the point where I want this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m20s)



[app to be a little more functional and I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m21s)



[might actually keep using this so I sort](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m25s)



[of want to add unit tests so let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m29s)



[down that path I'm wondering because I'd](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m35s)



[like to just keep this guy running while](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m42s)



[we are we unit test it right so we could](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m43s)



[publish let's just cheat real quick and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m50s)



[we'll just copy and paste right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h26m54s)



[hopefully a containing folder so if we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m01s)



[just grab bin-debug right so if we just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m04s)



[grab this guy and I'll just you know run](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m07s)



[them from the root how about remove me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m11s)



[that should hopefully keep me from doing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m21s)



[something stupid like checking it in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m23s)



[alright I hope](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m24s)



[and go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m29s)



[naturally it crashes right out the gate](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m34s)



[well all the more reason to have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m38s)



[subtitles interesting curious what the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m41s)



[crash is I won't have expected that to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m48s)



[break so easily since that was literally](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m54s)



[the same code that we're just running a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h27m59s)



[second ago](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m01s)



[so faulting application blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m02s)



[blah anything useful throw if fail oh I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m08s)



[know why because it's firing up and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m19s)



[doesn't have the the key there ain't no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m21s)



[key set all right so when we do on start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m26s)



[first thing it does is goes and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m32s)



[retrieves the the key for this guy so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m34s)



[that ain't gonna work](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m41s)



[so I can't actually launch this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m49s)



[outside of it without going and setting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m51s)



[this in my environment variables okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m53s)



[in the interest of speed we're just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h28m59s)



[gonna set it there so stand by and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m01s)



[Virant](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m07s)



[there that guy there create a new one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m12s)



[variable name paste variable value I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m18s)



[need to go and grab it real quick let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m22s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m27s)



[not you I need you and the properties](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m29s)



[edit and it real quick and I'm gonna be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m39s)



[good and not exposed and have to cycle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m43s)



[my key yet again paste okay okay put](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m45s)



[something else on my clipboard just so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m51s)



[that I don't accidentally expose it and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m53s)



[we're back okay so now let's it's not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h29m55s)



[open that window and jump over here and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m01s)



[now we should in theory be able to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m05s)



[launch right so launch start we didn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m09s)



[blow up right away okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m14s)



[now we can leave this version of the app](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m21s)



[running and we're gonna go back over](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m23s)



[here and let's see about actually unit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m25s)



[testing this because this is going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m27s)



[require a little bit of refactor so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m28s)



[let's see here Ms test sounds fine net](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m32s)



[core great stream subtitles tests great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m36s)



[and where we go if other people are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m46s)



[interested in actually like using this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m49s)



[app and whatnot I could be probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m51s)



[convinced to put it into some sort of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m54s)



[like squirrel installer or whatnot and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m57s)



[distribute so or even maybe a dotnet](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h30m59s)



[global tool that might be fun set it up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m02s)



[that way that way you can go out and run](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m06s)



[might be fun might be fun okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m09s)



[so in general with WPF you only ever](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m12s)



[unit test things in your view model and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m16s)



[you ignore your view right because the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m19s)



[the view model is designed to be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m21s)



[testable the view code is an absolutely](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m24s)



[miserable nightmare to try in unit test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m28s)



[but in our case we've got a couple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m31s)



[things that are problematic so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m33s)



[specifically everywhere where you see a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m35s)



[static method call that is problematic](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m38s)



[because static method calls implicitly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m40s)



[tightly coupled to bits of code together](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m43s)



[right so this constructor is tightly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m45s)



[coupled to the task Factory and the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m48s)



[start new method and the enable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m50s)



[collection synchronization and the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m52s)



[coupling isn't always bad if the static](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m54s)



[method is pure it's fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h31m57s)



[and by pure I mean a method that you can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m00s)



[invoke that has no side effects so like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m03s)



[most of your link methods are all not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m05s)



[most all link methods are pure right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m07s)



[they cause no side effects to the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m10s)



[original array or list or whatever](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m12s)



[you're iterating over but other static](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m13s)



[methods for example these can be quite](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m17s)



[problematic to go through and test so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m20s)



[we're probably gonna have to do a little](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m23s)



[bit of a refactor inside of all of this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m24s)



[and get some of this cleaned up there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m26s)



[also these things that are pretty much](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m27s)



[just hard-coded for now let's make these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m29s)



[privates so we don't have to think about](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m32s)



[it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m34s)



[okay so let's look at what what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m35s)



[actually unit tests so for starters](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m38s)



[we're gonna start off by renaming this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m40s)



[guy so unit test one is not really](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m42s)



[explicit so how about main window new](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m45s)



[model tests right yes please and we need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m48s)



[to add a reference to our project great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m54s)



[do that what did you perfect neck or 3/1](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h32m58s)



[that's what we wanted to see okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m02s)



[since we have that let's start at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m06s)



[top I don't know if there's anything](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m10s)



[significantly worth testing in here this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m16s)



[is not worth testing in my mind because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m20s)



[it's view related and implementation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m22s)



[detail and this will get tested](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m24s)



[implicitly later so we'll move on so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m25s)



[let's do let's do on start/stop right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m29s)



[naming schemes can be whatever you want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m35s)



[but they really should indicate what the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m38s)



[test is doing and the expectation in my](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m40s)



[mind so on my stop so on stop values](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m42s)



[cleared all right so we need a couple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m49s)



[things so I always follow the arrange](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m52s)



[act sir pattern and in general this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h33m56s)



[basically just means you have something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m03s)



[here that the let me back up the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m05s)



[arranged portion of the unit test is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m08s)



[where you do all the setup you need for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m09s)



[the test to succeed so in this case our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m12s)



[view model gets new main window view](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m14s)



[model right so our entire setup is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m17s)



[called the constructor the act portion](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m19s)



[is where we invoke the thing under test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m22s)



[so let's see vm stop command execute](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m24s)



[milk parameter all right we're just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m30s)



[gonna fire it off and then our assertion](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m32s)



[is going to be is null we should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m35s)



[probably set these to something so you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m38s)



[recognize her right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m40s)



[assert is null the pending tears all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m43s)



[right and it does in general some people](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m49s)



[will say that you should have only a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m53s)



[single assert statement in a unit test I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m54s)



[think that's a little prescriptive in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m56s)



[general I think you should assert on one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h34m58s)



[logical conclusion so in this case the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m00s)



[logical conclusion is this guy clears](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m04s)



[out all the relevant values so VM](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m06s)



[recognizer gets new speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m09s)



[speech config how can we do this so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m15s)



[here's what we're gonna do we are going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m25s)



[to just look class back Tori Spelling](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m28s)



[for the win static class alright I'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m35s)



[look static this guy doesn't have a nice](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m40s)



[interface over him does he I'd be way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m42s)



[too convenient am I gonna have to wrap](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m45s)



[it in one yeah I kind of figured out was](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m48s)



[a lot of times people don't wrap their](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m51s)



[stuff in interfaces people like doing it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m54s)



[the the problem being is then there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m56s)



[usually debate about what should go on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m58s)



[the interface and so a lot of people](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h35m59s)



[just don't bother and say wrap it in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m03s)



[whatever interface you want which is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m08s)



[fine it just means that I have to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m11s)



[work rather than somebody else doing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m12s)



[work so I think as long as we don't call](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m14s)



[start we can get away with you know](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m17s)



[something like this from subscription](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m20s)



[region West us alright so I think we can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m23s)



[get away with this we'll find out we may](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m31s)



[have to already break down and start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m33s)



[abstracting stuff but that is okay that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m35s)



[is what we expect so factory dot and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m39s)



[then](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m45s)



[nope move out to its own file please](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m48s)



[thanks back ok so then we will set up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m52s)



[pending text some text alright and let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h36m57s)



[just turn on live unit testing let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m06s)



[test live unit testing start because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m08s)



[this this thing is small enough that I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m13s)



[don't know if it like in general lives](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m15s)



[unit testing is supposed to handle a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m18s)



[significant amount of stuff but there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m20s)



[some projects where I just find that he](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m23s)



[it either bogs stuff down or doesn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m26s)



[work well or whatnot so ok first test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m28s)



[passes great we've got lots of green](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m32s)



[arrows on stuff that's being tested down](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m36s)



[wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m37s)



[it's worth noting that these green](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m39s)



[arrows are highly misleading they only](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m41s)



[tell you that the line was invoked so in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m43s)



[my mind the green checks mean nothing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m46s)



[it's all the blue arrows and any red X's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m48s)



[that matter because just because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m52s)



[something's executed during a unit test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m55s)



[doesn't actually mean it was tested or](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h37m57s)



[even tested well ok so that gives us](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m00s)



[that so now I think we move on to the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m05s)



[more interesting ones I think we do this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m08s)



[is probably work we're gonna have to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m12s)



[start getting getting a little bit fancy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m13s)



[right so I think what I would love to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m16s)



[is start with testing this get lines](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m20s)



[method right I think the easiest way to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m22s)



[test this is to take it out of the view](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m24s)



[model because right now this is stuck](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m27s)



[here in the view model but this can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m30s)



[easily be moved into its own class and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m35s)



[then unit test it directly there so I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m38s)



[think we're just going to start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m40s)



[shrinking our view model because this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m41s)



[isn't really related to the view model](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m43s)



[stuff this is just breaking apart some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m45s)



[strings what did call it though](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m47s)



[hey calling it something like text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m53s)



[helper feels way too generic](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m55s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h38m59s)



[how about line splitter that's a little](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m02s)



[more explicit and we'll make it static](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m08s)



[until we have a reason to change it so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m11s)



[step one move everything out all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m14s)



[so you come out you go in here poof and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m21s)



[all of that jazz and then let's see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m28s)



[we need typeface and font size okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m31s)



[you guys go here from now we're just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m39s)



[going to leave these values hard coded](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m42s)



[because theory nobody else is needing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m44s)



[them so this then changes to line](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m46s)



[splitter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m49s)



[get lines and that just works all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m50s)



[okay what is the red here what are you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h39m57s)



[squawking about cannot access private](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m00s)



[method well point moving it out well so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m03s)



[we could test it there we go so let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m06s)



[add some new unit tests for it add new](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m10s)



[class line splitter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m14s)



[test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m17s)



[let's see here nice class just method](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m21s)



[public void get lines how do we want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m31s)



[do this so what do we want to test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m39s)



[really right we want to test that it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m42s)



[splits up a long bit of text and we want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m44s)



[to test that it works if we give it a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m50s)



[short string that it that it works so I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m53s)



[think rather than test method here let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m56s)



[do this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m59s)



[in returns clients feels like a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h40m59s)



[data-driven test right because this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m07s)



[really is just string in strings out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m10s)



[let's see is it data method data test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m14s)



[method right and then data row so let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m19s)



[see string line so the first one is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m24s)



[something like Shh short string actually](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m31s)



[you know what we should do we should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m40s)



[just go grab some lorem ipsum next](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m41s)



[it's probably butchering the spelling](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m48s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m52s)



[generator that sounds like exactly what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m54s)



[I want so give me words give me like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h41m56s)



[pity it'll work great thank you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m03s)



[we're just gonna put this here I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m13s)



[that's what we want I guess how do we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m18s)



[want to do this right we code in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m20s)



[expectation of the first line the second](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m24s)



[line](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m31s)



[hmm I'm starting to question whether](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m39s)



[this is a good data driven test I mean](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m42s)



[because ideally what I would expected](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m46s)



[lines right like ideally this is how I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m49s)



[want to write it with just pre caning](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m51s)



[this the problem being this right I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h42m55s)



[can't actually declare it like this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m07s)



[what are you what are you telling me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m20s)



[here more data](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m22s)



[yeah because you are unhappy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m31s)



[let's see data source and I might have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m38s)



[to look this guy up table name a row](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m44s)



[let's string table name rocks method](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h43m47s)



[so let's just do this right we'll just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m05s)



[take this in and returns single line so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m11s)



[we'll just have this test be the the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m19s)



[single line case so arrange act cert cuz](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m23s)



[in general you want to avoid](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m31s)



[conditionals inside of your unit test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m33s)



[that's a recipe for disaster](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m35s)



[string line gets found line gets line](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m37s)



[splitter get lines about this becomes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m47s)



[text will make it match here so text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m52s)



[single right because single will throw](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h44m58s)



[if we get back more than one which is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m00s)



[what what we want there isn't really an](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m03s)



[arranged section and then what we have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m06s)



[is an assert are equal we expect that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m07s)



[the text to match the line](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m13s)



[I think what we're gonna do is we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m20s)



[just gonna start grabbing I think I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m23s)



[just gonna duplicate this all the way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m25s)



[across right no nope nope undo so let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m27s)



[see let's actually grab how far can we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m35s)



[get away with it's probably that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m39s)



[probably too much right so this is a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m43s)



[horrible way to do unit testing but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m49s)



[we're call it trial and error somewhere](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m51s)



[in this vicinity expected to pass right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h45m59s)



[so ding ding ding ding ding ding and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m01s)



[we'll just just keep shrinking just keep](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m04s)



[shrinking just keep shrinking oh this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m11s)



[guy is probably not gonna return the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m14s)



[extra white line we'll do the white line](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m17s)



[we'll do the white line case in a second](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m22s)



[and something akin to that right let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m25s)



[see here yeah I might keep that we might](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m33s)



[want it for multiple ones public void](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m37s)



[get long get lines lits into multiple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m41s)



[lines all right so this is just gonna be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m49s)



[a straight up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m52s)



[grabbed this whole thing for our text so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h46m59s)



[string](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m03s)



[nice long block of text we'll put the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m11s)



[comments back in range act cert so green](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m15s)



[lines gets on splitter get lines text to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m30s)



[array mister points for spelling okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m38s)



[and then is it collection assert I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m45s)



[yep are equal so we need to do up some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m49s)



[amount of building of this compare it to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h47m56s)



[lines right good test properly fails](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m01s)



[okay so let's let's take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m08s)



[this guy and see where the failure is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m11s)



[this is not a great way of doing it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m13s)



[because basically different number of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m16s)



[elements okay so let's just grab it here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m20s)



[and look at what the split looks like](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m23s)



[because I think this will probably get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m25s)



[us pretty close](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m28s)



[and so there's a bunch of stuff inside](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m34s)



[of this line splitter that we aren't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m36s)



[testing right now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m37s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m40s)



[so let's see I wish there was a need can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m45s)



[I just do this yes I can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m51s)



[boom where'd my immediate when to go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h48m54s)



[come back Thanks that's what I needed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m01s)



[grab you copy paste alright so see walk](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m04s)



[edit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m16s)



[ding-ding-ding-ding and then we just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m16s)



[need commas on all of these and in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m22s)



[theory this is basically a pinning unit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m23s)



[test to depend the existing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m27s)



[functionality normally we would have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m29s)



[wanted to write these ahead of time and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m32s)



[verify the failure in to pass etc etc](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m34s)



[etc but for now we're only pinning for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m36s)



[the idea that when we make changes in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m40s)



[the future](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m43s)



[I want to make sure this lines up ok so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m43s)



[that's probably good enough for now and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m48s)



[that's good enough for what we need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m52s)



[ok back to our main window view model](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m54s)



[now this is where it's gonna start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m57s)



[getting interesting so let's first clear](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h49m59s)



[up a little bit of those that keystroke](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m01s)



[was control RG I think we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m04s)



[gonna get rid of this checked because it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m10s)



[doesn't matter we're gonna get rid of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m12s)



[all of these commented code because it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m14s)



[doesn't matter we're gonna get rid of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m16s)



[all of these because they don't matter I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m18s)



[think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m24s)



[at some point we probably want to deal](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m33s)



[with this problem right I don't know if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m35s)



[this makes a big difference but let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m40s)



[through probably leaking a little bit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m42s)



[because this guy has a task that's right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m49s)



[this guy had a TCS for actually going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m54s)



[through and clearing this up I don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m57s)



[think we need to do this I think what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h50m59s)



[we're going to do is we're going to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m01s)



[this all right now we're going to come](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m03s)



[up here and if recognizer is speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m06s)



[named it the same then we just paste](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m23s)



[here and change all of these two minuses](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m26s)



[right so insert minus minus minus minus](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m30s)



[and actually while we're in here we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m43s)



[leave canceled around but I don't think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m46s)



[we need these ones right we're only](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m48s)



[really using a few of these so let's not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m50s)



[let's make our life easier so we don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m54s)



[need this don't need this don't need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h51m56s)



[this which means all of these zero](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m00s)



[reference methods just fall right off](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m02s)



[the food chain](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m05s)



[great get rid of that get rid of that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m07s)



[get rid of that now we're getting](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m09s)



[something that looks a little better](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m11s)



[okay Oh fine object match pattern you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m15s)



[can be here at a happy resharper I can't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m23s)



[decide if I actually like this better or](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m25s)



[worse it feels weird feels very weird no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m27s)



[ability of type does not match the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m32s)



[target delegate event handler](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m35s)



[types in parameter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m43s)



[Hue's so hold on are you so let's let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m52s)



[pick on this one are you complaining](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h52m59s)



[because you want this because object](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m00s)



[sender could be know is that the whole](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m05s)



[complaint there okay make sense](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m08s)



[okay so throw that guy way too right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m26s)



[okay so that cleans up those warnings](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m33s)



[that cleans up those warnings everyone's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m35s)



[happy what's this warning down here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m38s)



[function never returns](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m42s)



[yep that's problem we should fix it okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m44s)



[but we'll come back to this so right now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m47s)



[what we want to do is set up so that we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m49s)



[can test these recognizers and the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m51s)



[problem is is this guy is not going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m54s)



[be an easy thing to unit test all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h53m56s)



[so ultimately what we need to do is put](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m00s)



[him away in a factory somewhere I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m03s)



[yeah I think that's what we're going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m09s)



[do let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m11s)



[and honestly we could take all of the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m18s)



[region and the region language out of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m21s)



[the view model let's do that let's clean](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m23s)



[that up so we're gonna hide him behind](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m26s)



[interface so i speech wreck sir okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m28s)



[we'll do a public class and decide the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m44s)



[best way to go through and inject this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m55s)



[do we create a factory or do we just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h54m59s)



[because ultimately the constructors](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m08s)



[themselves are effectively static](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m11s)



[methods which is problematic so there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m12s)



[a tight coupling here and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m16s)



[if putting this guy behind an interface](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m18s)



[so first of all this guy is going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m21s)



[become aye-aye-aye](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m25s)



[right the first thing we need to do that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m32s)



[I can tell right off the bat is we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m35s)



[gonna drive from my disposable okay fix](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m37s)



[us some of it and now obviously we have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m43s)



[all of these events to deal with so the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m45s)



[question is what do how do we want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m50s)



[interact with this thing right how do we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m52s)



[want to instantiate a new one of these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m54s)



[when we're ready for it I think I almost](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h55m56s)



[like the idea of another factory](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m00s)



[so the factory all right that is dumb](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m07s)



[see here so I think for now we're not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m24s)



[going to pass anything in the factory I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m30s)



[think we're just gonna let it do a ton](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m36s)



[of work for us and we won't stress won't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m38s)



[stress the small stuff so main window](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m41s)



[view model now needs a factory so we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m43s)



[gonna take it as a dependency let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m47s)



[so let's see create a read-only field](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m52s)



[sounds great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m56s)



[check parameter for null sounds great so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h56m58s)



[that means down here rather than passing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m01s)



[this config what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m03s)



[speech recognition factory get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m06s)



[recognizer right and then this should no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m08s)



[longer be a var because that is not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m11s)



[clear and use curly braces I think those](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m13s)



[are left over from an old using in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m20s)



[original code there's that wondering if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m21s)



[this should be a sync now don't do it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m27s)



[till we need it don't do it till we need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m30s)



[it so now we actually need two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m33s)



[implementations of this guy right and I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m36s)



[will explain I tend to really like the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m39s)



[port adapter simulator unit test pattern](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m43s)



[so see port adapter simulator there is a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m46s)



[wonderful blog post here it's a little](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m52s)



[old but no less relevant that goes over](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h57m56s)



[this this pattern here it's very similar](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m01s)



[to if anybody's used mocks you can](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m04s)



[almost imagine that sort of style here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m08s)



[except for the the problem with mocks is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m11s)



[that in your unit test you've got no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m16s)



[assertions that your mock has been](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m18s)



[set up to behave like a real instance](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m20s)



[right so there's bugs that always creep](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m23s)



[past your mocs](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m25s)



[and it's like well I unit test this so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m26s)



[it's like well your your Mach is set up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m28s)



[one way but the real thing doesn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m30s)



[behave that way so in the port adapter](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m32s)



[simulator pattern rather than using mock](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m35s)



[objects you actually write multiple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m37s)



[implementations or a real implementation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m40s)



[and then a simulator implementation and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m43s)



[ideally if possible you run this set a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m46s)



[unit test against both implementations](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m49s)



[to verify that one is a good replacement](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m51s)



[for the other Liskov substitution](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m53s)



[principle for those people familiar with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m56s)



[solid basically unit testing to ensure](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h58m58s)



[that you actually have two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m01s)



[implementations that conform to the same](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m04s)

[obviously one would be backed by a real](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m10s)



[service one would not and so once you're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m12s)



[confident that your unit testing one is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m15s)



[a good replacement you can use it in all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m17s)



[your unit tests and it'll behave in a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m20s)



[nice consistent manner for you okay with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m21s)



[that said we've got this so let's go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m25s)



[speech recognizer factory we got to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m28s)



[build us one of these right and for now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m32s)



[let's see public class speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m35s)



[factory and for now in the interest of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m42s)



[just testing the view model we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m46s)



[hard code a whole bunch of stuff all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m48s)



[right just to make this thing work so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m50s)



[first of all we're gonna take these two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m52s)



[things out this is now a factory concern](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m54s)



[not not anything else these guys are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=01h59m57s)



[just gonna hang out here for now let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m02s)



[see here so those guys go away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m04s)



[this whole config thing this is an](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m07s)



[implementation detail so those go into](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m12s)



[here right so implement and then we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m16s)



[going to return a new speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m20s)



[config so we need an implementation of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m26s)



[i speech recognizer and for this I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m31s)



[what we're going to do is we're just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m34s)



[going to do a nested class](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m35s)



[thinking we just do not sold on this but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m47s)



[for now it will do it will do let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h00m53s)



[so if we hurry up and do this and take](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m01s)



[in a speech recognizer boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m06s)



[alright and then this guy implement](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m12s)



[check parameter for null this guy here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m16s)



[delegate implementation - backing field](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m20s)



[yeah great thanks there's our new speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m24s)



[recognizer a rapper don't know why it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m34s)



[duplicated that for me but thank you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m38s)



[okay so not great but at least gets us](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m40s)



[where we're going right so move this out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m44s)



[and then rather than declaring this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m47s)



[straight up in our zamel we are going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m50s)



[get rid of this because this is not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m53s)



[gonna work anymore and we'll just do it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m54s)



[in our code behind for now so let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m56s)



[clean that up data context gets new main](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h01m59s)



[window view model new speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m04s)



[factory so we're going to pass the real](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m08s)



[implementation here and obviously in our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m10s)



[instantiation of this in our unit test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m12s)



[we are not going to do that that would](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m15s)



[be bad okay so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m19s)

[time](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m39s)



[interesting oh I know why because my](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m40s)



[stream Labs thing is pointed at a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m44s)



[different output file well let's fix](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m46s)



[that real quick right done there we go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m50s)



[at some point I there's a an SDK for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h02m57s)



[stream labs that I'm thinking would let](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m01s)



[me edit these things from this tool](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m03s)



[which would be very convenient very very](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m06s)



[convenient okay so yeah you you be happy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m14s)



[you sit there okay so we got that we got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m18s)



[that probably clean some of these things](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m21s)



[up maybe change a couple API is on this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m25s)



[to make it a little less ugly okay so we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m29s)



[got a factory factory needs a couple](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m35s)



[more members or I should say this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m37s)



[needs members create method so this is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m39s)



[going to be a task start continuous I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m44s)



[think what we're going to do is we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m48s)



[just going to hide this and call it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m50s)



[start recognition all right make it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m53s)



[because we're now in control of this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m56s)



[right we get to do this what I want and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h03m58s)



[I think what we're gonna do in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m01s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m11s)



[all right because cancelled as we saw](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m12s)



[before there's no way to cancel a client](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m15s)



[side so we're just gonna have these two](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m17s)



[things so let's see speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m21s)



[factory has the implementation you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m29s)



[implement return speech recognizer start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m32s)



[continuous recognition async configure](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m38s)



[await false return wait a a sink boom I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m42s)



[guess we don't need the return and you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h04m54s)



[know offering me the lambda body](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m00s)



[opportunity to expression body thank you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m02s)



[some of them were like that okay so that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m07s)



[works we were gonna grab the it's gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m12s)



[look real quick at the callbacks here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m19s)



[I'm wondering if we hide away these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m23s)



[actual implementations I think we do and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m28s)



[I think we do something really ugly for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m37s)



[the moment so we only have recognized](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m40s)



[and recognizing so event event handler](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m44s)



[string will you let me get away with](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m48s)



[that all right nice zine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m51s)



[this is a horrible way to abuse this but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h05m59s)



[again gonna get it tested and then or I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m03s)



[should say we're going to get unit tests](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m08s)



[written and then we'll go through and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m09s)



[clean this up probably not tonight but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m10s)



[so string text oh wait this is string](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m16s)



[text and object throw away technically](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m25s)



[sender well and so then this just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m35s)



[becomes text will basically just unwrap](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m39s)



[this guy love that it lets me get away](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m44s)



[with that okay so more clean up there](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m50s)



[more clean up there everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m53s)



[you know we're gonna clean some of you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m57s)



[up here in a minute you'll notice the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h06m59s)



[tests aren't running because of this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m01s)



[constructor change guarantee it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m04s)



[blocking the compile on the yeah I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m05s)



[understand you're unhappy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m08s)



[you're not compiling well fix you in a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m09s)



[minute let's see so here we need to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m11s)



[implement a couple members alright so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m14s)



[we've got a couple events it's great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m20s)



[I think what we do is just down here we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m26s)



[do extracting those are recognizing plus](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m29s)



[equals this boom boom and then recognize](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m34s)



[een null safe and then we'll do I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m41s)



[this you know result that text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m48s)



[expression body that guy thanks this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h07m57s)



[doesn't need to be overly fancy and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m01s)



[you're unhappy because knowable right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m05s)



[let's see recognized we need will just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m10s)



[preempt it let's see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m20s)



[recognized invoke this e dot result text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m24s)



[alright and once again nullable make you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m33s)



[happy some point I'm gonna go flip on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m38s)



[the warnings as air stuff just to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m41s)



[annoying me into fixing all of them but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m44s)



[that is not the current task so start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m47s)



[command you don't think it's ever](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m51s)



[invoked that is because we did not set](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m55s)



[up our design time data context let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h08m58s)



[see D :](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m02s)



[data con text right C D design instance](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m04s)



[type gets main window view model design](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m14s)



[time creatable is false so this just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m22s)



[gives a hint to the intellisense to tell](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m26s)



[it what our view model type is but tells](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m30s)



[that don't try to create one you're not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m32s)



[going to be able to so and now it's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m34s)



[happier about that because it knows that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m39s)



[it's used it's just the method that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m40s)



[not looping down there okay so that gets](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m43s)



[us all there that gets that all working](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m47s)



[let's go back to our unit test alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m50s)



[so what we have down here is this is not](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h09m52s)



[going to work so one get recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m01s)



[needs to return a nice speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m03s)



[which is very different and how about a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m05s)



[public static a speech recognizer a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m09s)



[factory get nice or factory right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m12s)



[we're gonna new up a couple new thingies](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m15s)



[in here so a public class speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m19s)



[recognizer factory and I usually let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m23s)



[let's go and do this slightly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m28s)



[differently because I usually create a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m30s)



[simulators namespace I'm not sold on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m32s)



[this organization but because I tend to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m35s)



[name my simulator implementations](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m39s)



[exactly matching my real ones just helps](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m42s)



[me disambiguate which one I'm talking](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m47s)



[about so let's see that guy there is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m49s)



[gonna need some members great public](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m53s)



[class speech nicer by the end of this I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h10m56s)



[will learn how to spell it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m04s)



[hopefully I haven't made too many](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m08s)



[spelling mistakes boom okay so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m09s)



[to implement but this guy's going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m14s)



[Richard showing a new speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m17s)



[great so no not what I wanted](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m21s)



[expression body okay so that makes the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m26s)



[factory easy return you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m28s)



[simulators that's the one I want right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m37s)



[return you actually you know what I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m42s)



[think I want to do is I want this guy to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m46s)



[just get recognizer factory](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m48s)



[get recognizer I don't want this thing I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m52s)



[don't want to duplicate any logic okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h11m54s)



[back over here so this becomes factory](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m00s)



[get factory that gets that going I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m06s)



[that should unblock the unit tests sit](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m12s)



[here they're there they're there they're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m16s)



[just build I'm kind of wondering if I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m18s)



[got a reek ick this into gear I think it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m21s)



[just picks up once once you can start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m24s)



[recompiling build succeeded it's turning](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m26s)



[live unit test back on apparently at a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m29s)



[certain point it just gives up on me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m32s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m39s)



[covered by one test hey look at that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m42s)



[we've already got failing tests I'm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m44s)



[guessing but uh speech recognizer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m47s)



[disposed so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h12m54s)



[these guys we gotta actually build out](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m03s)



[just beat recognized our factory speech](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m06s)



[recognizer so move you over please](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m08s)



[okay so the disposer that I think we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m13s)



[just don't do anything with right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m15s)



[because there's nothing nothing to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m17s)



[with here I think what I would like to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m19s)



[do though is private well no because the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m23s)



[goal is for this thing to behave](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m27s)



[identically to the real one which isn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m28s)



[gonna quite be the case but we'll make](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m30s)



[it we'll make it work trying to decide](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m34s)



[of a good way of generating out text I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m40s)



[think the simplest implementation is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m44s)



[don't we have this guy yeah great we've](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m49s)



[got some text right here okay so we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h13m54s)



[gonna have this guy just sort of start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m02s)



[once this starts a start run right we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m05s)



[gonna just get this guy going and he's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m11s)



[gonna fire stuff off and make the events](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m15s)



[go](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m19s)



[let's see here actually let's let's wrap](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m26s)



[this up a little nice our private tasks](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m29s)



[emulate text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m34s)



[okay so this guy is literally just going](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m44s)



[to return simulate text actually let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m48s)



[do this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h14m54s)



[they're cleaner okay so we need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m03s)



[something to hend - so how about a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m09s)



[private stringbuilder all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m14s)



[current text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m21s)



[it's new stringbuilder alright](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m30s)



[private string get next word from now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m38s)



[you're just going to return an empty](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m46s)



[string but that'll need to be](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m47s)



[implemented and then so our simulate](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m50s)



[text is going to be digit I don't want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h15m53s)



[to do this I like we just randomly grab](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m01s)



[words we'll just do it and a group of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m03s)



[let's see how big how big is this one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m07s)



[two three four five six seven oh that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m09s)



[clever one two three four five six seven](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m16s)



[eight nine ten so in the realm of I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m18s)



[don't know fifteen sixteen words so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m24s)



[Const and word count gets 16 probably](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m29s)



[can be smarter so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m35s)



[I think what we're gonna do is a syntax](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m44s)



[right for int I actually I guess we do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m47s)



[this for each string word and numerable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h16m59s)



[range so start at 0 give me a word count](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m12s)



[all right so current text pens a oh this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m17s)



[needs to actually select throw away get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m28s)



[next word right we might go through and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m37s)



[past the index in a minute so we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m41s)



[gonna add a word and sure we need to add](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m46s)



[a space and and I think yeah just do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h17m55s)



[that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m06s)



[and then I think this is we raise](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m10s)



[recognizing here VOC this current tax to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m14s)



[string all right so lots a string copy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m21s)



[that's gonna happen but whatever and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m23s)



[then at the very end we will do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m26s)



[recognized invoke this correct text to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m29s)



[string current text clear we'll go back](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m40s)



[and do it all over again so this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m46s)



[needs to be null checked and then we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m49s)



[need to have some way of cleaning this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m51s)



[guy up and stopping them and right now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m52s)



[our stopping gets triggered by this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m54s)



[dispose method so I am thinking](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m55s)



[something like a cancellation token me](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h18m59s)



[so let's do elation token source](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m03s)



[how's that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m18s)



[that one CTS](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m23s)



[yes cancel okay boom gets new](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m34s)



[cancellation doing this I'm not sure do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m43s)



[we actually need to set this I don't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m45s)



[think so I think the implication is that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m50s)



[we're only going to do this one at a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m51s)



[time](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m52s)



[so our token gets ETS token and token](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h19m53s)



[gets put here and we're going to just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m03s)



[pass it down into simulate text token](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m07s)



[all right put that in there because I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m11s)



[think something else we're gonna do down](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m19s)



[here hey what are you doing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m21s)



[catch up to me so I think what we do is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m25s)



[we wrap this guy so--wow token is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m28s)



[cancellation requested so you haven't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m32s)



[stopped no](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m35s)



[keep looping okay that guy's gonna run](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m40s)



[yeah I'm sure we sharper cause to hang](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m43s)



[what a shock okay so then we'll wait](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m45s)



[test delay I don't know 100 milliseconds](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m51s)



[kind of debating whether we want the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h20m58s)



[delay in here or not this is for the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m01s)



[purposes of testing so might not need](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m05s)



[nor want it alright so this I think this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m10s)



[is just gonna go void real quick there's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m16s)



[no point making it more complicated than](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m19s)



[it needs to be this guy goes here if how](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m22s)



[about just do this token throw of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m30s)



[cancellation requested okay so back to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m37s)



[our lorem ipsum text right so we've got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m42s)



[this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m45s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m47s)



[actually let's do this let's go should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m56s)



[go I numerable strength yet words and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h21m58s)



[then this becomes a lot simpler this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m11s)



[just as get words right and then I'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m13s)



[have this guy's limit it to just word](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m19s)



[count and we'll make this an infinite](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m23s)



[innumerable all right so while true boom](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m25s)



[let's do this open up a code real quick](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m33s)



[it's ultimately what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m38s)



[not have that open okay so there's all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m42s)



[our text right so let's search on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m47s)



[whitespace all right and we'll replace](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m54s)



[white space with a new line oh that's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h22m57s)



[that's more like what I want so the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m04s)



[place long list of words great so find](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m08s)



[the beginning character place what the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m12s)



[quote do it okay find the end of the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m16s)



[string place with quote comma do it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m21s)



[okay oh we actually want at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m27s)



[beginning of the string we want to find](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m29s)



[yield return place great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m34s)



[yay regex coding so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m39s)



[dump all that in oh not quite what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m46s)



[wanted so let's go back we don't what we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m51s)



[want to find is comma end right and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h23m55s)



[we'll replace with semicolon](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m00s)



[no copy come back over here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m07s)



[undo paste that looks better and we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m11s)



[just let this guy go be an infant in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m17s)



[innumerable that will just Chuck through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m20s)



[all those words spew them out okay dad I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m22s)



[think probably gets us closer and let's](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m28s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m31s)



[you can be static wonderful wonderful](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m32s)



[wonderful wonderful wonderful you claim](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m35s)



[yellow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m39s)



[why are you yellow oh because this thing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m39s)



[never returns right okay fine](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m43s)



[we'll just send the token in right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h24m52s)



[we'll make it happy it'll make it think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m02s)



[that it has an exit point then we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m04s)



[gonna hit it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m06s)



[you see it's unlikely to hit but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m09s)



[whatever now it's happy okay so now we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m12s)



[have all of this work all this so that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m17s)



[we can just start unit testing this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m19s)



[beast all right so let's go back over](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m21s)



[here so the thing that we actually want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m26s)



[to unit test close close close close](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m28s)



[close is the on start method right so on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m29s)



[start should do a couple things it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m36s)



[should set the recognizer and it should](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m37s)



[register for events and call start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m39s)



[recognizing so we probably want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m44s)



[change up our simulator a little bit so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m49s)



[that we have some control over it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m50s)



[otherwise it should kind of repeatedly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m53s)



[fire off the same stuff over and over](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m55s)



[and over and over and over but for now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h25m57s)



[this will be this will be a good start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m01s)



[so test method public void on start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m03s)



[creates right so we'll go down go down](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m13s)



[this path so this guy here gets a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m25s)



[factory great we're gonna say start](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m30s)



[command gets executed and is not null on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m36s)



[the recognizer right boom unit test now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m40s)



[passes it does what we would all hope](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m44s)



[for I am wondering if](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m49s)



[and it's fine this guy falls out of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m55s)



[scope that falls out of scope](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m57s)



[there's no references everything gets](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h26m59s)



[garbage collected okay not a problem](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m01s)



[okay so let's see about testing this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m04s)



[year - because right so the next thing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m07s)



[that we really want to verify is one](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m10s)



[that as once we call start as this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m14s)



[recognizer is firing stuff off like for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m17s)



[example we want to verify that the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m20s)



[pending text is working so let's give](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m22s)



[ourselves some means of handling this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m24s)



[and I think the simplest way to do this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m33s)



[is just to have this guy taken in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m36s)



[enumerable right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m41s)



[I think that's probably the easiest](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m46s)



[so let's let's look at that what what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m50s)



[would that look like so this guy takes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m53s)



[an an ienumerable of string words right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h27m55s)



[and introduce that we allow for null all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m01s)



[right so let's we're gonna make it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m10s)



[knowable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m13s)



[oh no bubbles probably not turned on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m14s)



[here is it let's turn that on no wool](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m18s)



[Mabel Mabel or enabled enable okay](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m25s)



[we're gonna just private that guy up](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m34s)



[let's see here so so this guy down here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m38s)



[for simulate text so he's either gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m42s)



[we're just gonna do something around](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m46s)



[here right I'm kind of wondering if for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m49s)



[the purposes of this we wrapped the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h28m59s)



[whole thing right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m03s)



[let's see what is this so words home to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m15s)



[many closing price right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m23s)



[yeah so if they've specified we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m33s)



[iterate through them all and then we'll](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m36s)



[bail](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m39s)



[yeah and then it should call right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m47s)



[the the caller then is in control of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m49s)



[this great okay so let's give ourselves](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m51s)



[access to this we've taken it in here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m53s)



[let's see what is it saying no knowable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h29m58s)



[recognizing well events certainly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m03s)



[nullable alright so those are legit so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m11s)



[this guy here this factory to do to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m17s)



[did you do a new role string words get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m25s)



[set alright well let that thing flow](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m36s)



[we'll just pass it through here everyone](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m38s)



[can be happy this guy can be public I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m42s)



[think we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m47s)



[let's see I numerable string words we're](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h30m52s)



[gonna let it be optional which means](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m00s)



[that goes nillable words gets words what](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m03s)



[do you words maybe we all here possible](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m12s)



[no reference no that's just because that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m17s)



[should be declared like that okay and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m24s)



[clean that up okay so now let's go back](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m30s)



[to our test so this guy we know works on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m34s)



[recognize een I cannot spell that to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m47s)



[save my life](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h31m53s)



[and recognizing a few lates we call it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m02s)



[current text pending text pending text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m10s)



[how about rather than populates sets](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m16s)



[it's just as clear and it's so sets](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m18s)



[right so our certian is going to be our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m22s)



[equal feu vm pending text which I think](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m26s)



[I kind of want to have I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m40s)



[have this be params string right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h32m45s)



[right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m04s)



[so it's failing which begs the question](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m07s)



[why actual null sets pending sex so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m09s)



[start command possibly a timing thing](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m15s)



[because this is at a start run right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m20s)



[mmm](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m29s)



[so we have to do something different](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m38s)



[here we could wait for the property](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m42s)



[change but oh I always hate those](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m45s)



[there's always timing bugs with around](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m47s)



[those we could make this guy run](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m49s)



[synchronously maybe that's the better](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h33m55s)



[solution here right simulate tax return](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m02s)



[tasks completed tasks](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m12s)



[what's going on something hung](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m27s)



[I'm wondering if that oh right because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m32s)



[this thing's gonna run forever in the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m38s)



[case where I don't pass text it's just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m42s)



[gonna keep going and going going so this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m44s)



[guy should not be an infinite enumerable](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m48s)



[right this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h34m53s)



[there that should get that out of the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m04s)



[infinite running State](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m06s)



[stop and relaunch I think that I'd get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m12s)



[it back](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m17s)



[what are you doing so output test](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m22s)



[Explorer](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m30s)



[20 guru which one of your hyung why is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m34s)



[it hum](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m38s)



[let's say speech recognizer comes in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m46s)



[simulates text start recognition async](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m48s)



[comes in raise raise raise I guess we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h35m54s)



[don't even need the token anymore do we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m01s)



[we can literally just iterate across all](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m03s)



[of these things](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m05s)



[timeout okay so let's let's clean some](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m13s)



[of this up right so this goes away this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m21s)



[goes away this goes away so this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m23s)



[shouldn't throw anymore this shouldn't](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m28s)



[throw anymore](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m30s)



[don't actually even need don't even](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m32s)



[really need the token don't you the task](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m37s)



[don't need any of this okay oh this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m42s)



[ain't gonna fly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h36m49s)



[okay so that gets us closer oh this is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m04s)



[mm because we change this thing to a](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m17s)



[params this is actually broken now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m20s)



[so I should check it so only if words](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m34s)



[dot any do we set words otherwise we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m38s)



[said no right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m42s)



[cert are equal failed okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m51s)



[is Noah is not doing what we expect](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m56s)



[perfect so now we figure out why so this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h37m57s)



[guy's registered start recognition async](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m04s)



[so recognizing event handler and maybe](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m07s)



[we just pick it up in here](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m11s)



[so test Explorer stop debug will see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m20s)



[what is going on here okay so it comes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m31s)



[in words has a single word no don't care](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m36s)



[that is our word we append we append you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m45s)



[invoke our event Oh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m50s)



[okay so there's a space on the end that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m54s)



[we didn't account for oh and then we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h38m56s)



[call recognized ooh](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m00s)



[which recognized is going to clear our](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m13s)



[pending text okay I didn't wanna have to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m17s)



[do it but apparently I'm going to have](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m21s)



[to so I have code that handles this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m23s)



[already because I don't really want to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m26s)



[change it to try to grab it part way](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m32s)



[through but these bindable properties](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m33s)



[like this the the simple way to test and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m37s)



[started doing unit testing easier this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m43s)



[one so for those people who are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m47s)



[interested blog post I wrote what you](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m50s)



[can do is on the inotify property](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m54s)



[changed](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m57s)



[you can grab there's a link at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h39m58s)



[bottom of this completed of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m01s)



[implementation](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m04s)



[property changed helper](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m12s)



[I think this is what I want](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m15s)



[you can just watch the property change](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m20s)



[notifications and record the values that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m23s)



[come up see so in our case we can just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m25s)



[watch the pending text and validate that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m33s)



[we actually see the stuff come through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m35s)



[that we want so change the namespace](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m39s)



[okay and we'll just we'll just basically](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m45s)



[watch all of these and record them so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m49s)



[we'll change our tests up here right so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m51s)



[VM watch property changes of type string](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h40m55s)



[we're looking for name of main window](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m00s)



[view model pending text right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m04s)



[pending text changes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m16s)



[so this guy here is actually of type I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m26s)



[property changed but what we can do is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m29s)



[rather than validating this we'll switch](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m33s)



[over and go with collection assert and I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m36s)



[will assert that the values I expect](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m41s)



[this thing to go between our flu and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m44s)



[then no all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m46s)



[and so then rather than checking this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m49s)



[what I end up checking is pending text](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m52s)



[changes to array](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h41m54s)



[so now we're on the test we should see](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m07s)



[those both come through](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m14s)



[all right so element at index is zero](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m17s)



[don't match well that's not horribly](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m20s)



[helpful what is the element at index](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m23s)



[zero just telling me they don't match](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m26s)



[does not give me any information](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m30s)



[okay so this guy here five pending texts](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m35s)



[this is probably the extra space at the](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m43s)



[end so this guy here too should be that](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m46s)



[all right](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h42m57s)



[now it passes huzzah okay at some point](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m02s)



[we probably want to deal with this extra](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m07s)



[space but whatever cooky that gives us](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m08s)



[that what other things are we interested](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m14s)



[in](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m16s)



[so we validated both this line and this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m19s)



[line in here this is going to be another](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m23s)



[problematic area right because we've got](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m29s)



[something adding into these subtitle](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m32s)



[lines but we've got no no Watchers on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m35s)



[this to know to be able to actually](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m41s)



[check it I think for now](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m46s)



[it's getting a little late I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m50s)



[commit what I have so ooh yeah on stage](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m52s)



[all changes so let's start with this](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m57s)



[tree stage stage stage the remove me is](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h43m59s)



[not what we want to stage and we'll just](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m06s)



[kind of briefly stat check all of these](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m09s)



[but I think all of these are fine to do](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m11s)



[I think all of that is fine as well](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m15s)



[let's just launch it real quick to make](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m20s)



[sure it still runs](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m21s)



[and I'm not sure how it works when](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m27s)



[you've got two instances going but](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m29s)



[apparently it works just fine cool so we](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m33s)



[do technically have two instances of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m41s)



[this thing which is quite awesome great](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m42s)



[great great great so that that works so](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m52s)



[it runs unit tests pass starting work on](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h44m56s)



[unit testing great commit push we'll get](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m01s)



[that out there and it now runs so for](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m08s)



[anyone who made it through the entire](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m12s)



[stream thank you very much for coming](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m13s)



[and hanging out again I figured this was](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m14s)



[just gonna be an ad hoc thing because I](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m17s)



[was planning on sitting out here and](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m19s)



[coding anyway whoo you get crackin yes](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m20s)

[anyone else thinks they might find it](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m42s)



[useful and would like to see something](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m43s)



[added in some like more official](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m45s)



[distribution let me know in the comments](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m48s)

[say signing off for people who are](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m52s)



[interested in my regular stream I am](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m54s)



[planning on picking up Thursday because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h45m56s)



[I'm on vacation there may be a bunch of](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h46m00s)



[just kind of random ad-hoc streams where](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h46m01s)



[I stream whatever I'm working on because](https://youtu.be/JuMwRgrQIco?t=02h46m03s)
