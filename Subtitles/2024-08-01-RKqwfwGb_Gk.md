[hello everyone welcome back uh my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m02s)

[apologies for the later start it was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m04s)

[only half my fault I'm going to blame](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m05s)

[the other half on my good pal Casey uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m07s)

[which we'll get to that in just a moment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m10s)

[so quick update um as I've announced](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m12s)

[before I am moving in the very near](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m14s)

[future and I finally have a moving date](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m16s)

[so next week there will be a stream the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m19s)

[following week uh so for people who are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m21s)

[watching this in the future uh August](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m24s)

[14th is going to be cancelled so I I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m26s)

[that's literally moving day for me so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m30s)

[there's there's just no possible way I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m32s)

[won't have a computer and I won't have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m34s)

[an internet connection which are kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m35s)

[two required things to be doing this um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m37s)

[I am hoping by the 21st I actually have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m39s)

[a streaming setup at my new place and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m41s)

[ready to go but there's a chance that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m43s)

[that may not happen um the room where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m45s)

[I'm supposed to be setting up my new](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m48s)

[office in is unfinished and so we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m49s)

[going to see how fast I can do sheetrock](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m52s)

[mudding paint carpet Etc so there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m54s)

[there's a chance by the 21 first I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h00m58s)

[have a room completely done being](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m00s)

[remodeled and instead of streaming I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m01s)

[spend the time building a streaming room](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m03s)

[so um but aside from that you know end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m05s)

[of August the 28th I expect to probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m09s)

[be back so for people who are following](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m11s)

[along](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m14s)

[watch uh either Twitter or Discord and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m16s)

[yeah construction stream yeah that'll be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m20s)

[exciting I don't think people want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m22s)

[watch that that's that's just a lot of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m23s)

[pain and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m26s)

[suffering uh okay so back to the fun](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m27s)

[stuff Casey](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m31s)

[welcome hola how you doing good so last](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m33s)

[week for those people who didn't who](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m38s)

[weren't here we started down the path of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m39s)

[turning me into my own chat GPT bot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m41s)

[which uh Merry Christmas to you yzzy uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m45s)

[the the idea being that I have a GitHub](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m50s)

[repo where I have downloaded all of my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m52s)

[uh subtitle tracks from YouTube uh let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h01m57s)

[see if for anybody who wants to play](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m00s)

[along at home here's the repo um and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m01s)

[buried underneath here is all this all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m04s)

[these markdown files nicely dated and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m06s)

[whatnot for me with all the stuff I've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m08s)

[ever said on stream which is terrifying](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m11s)

[but it also means I've got a nice easy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m14s)

[way to search it but wouldn't it be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m15s)

[better if I could turn myself into a bot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m16s)

[and use this as my source material that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m20s)

[sounds pretty](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m22s)

[cool um because then the bot learns how](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m23s)

[much Mountain Dew is awesome](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m26s)

[at least I'm I'm assuming that's what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m30s)

[it's going to learn so we started down](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m31s)

[that path for those people wondering uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m32s)

[here is so last week July 24th we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m35s)

[started uh this is my Azure spend over](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m38s)

[the last week it doesn't really account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m41s)

[for today this has delayed a little bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m43s)

[so but you can see as of last week 383](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m46s)

[okayy I'm not sharing my screen with you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m50s)

[am](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m52s)

[I you're not yet and I was I was going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m53s)

[to tell you after you got through this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m55s)

[that unless you wanted to be me to be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m57s)

[couple seconds delayed then you probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h02m59s)

[yeah so there there's a you can have a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m02s)

[live share but yeah so the vast majority](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m04s)

[of this is the database right so of my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m07s)

[383 331 of that is database we got a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m10s)

[little bit in storage account a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m14s)

[bit in cognitive service and a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m16s)

[bit in bandwidth but overall there's not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m17s)

[like this so the point being this is ye](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m21s)

[cheap like very cheap to run at least at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m24s)

[present um at some point we got to host](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m28s)

[this sucker somewhere and that'll add a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m30s)

[little bit but I think it's gonna be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m32s)

[cheap I think it'll be pretty pretty](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m35s)

[reasonable still yeah so I did a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m37s)

[work after what we did last Stream So](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m39s)

[for people who are a little confused on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m42s)

[what happened last fantastic um so the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m43s)

[sum total of most of our code lives](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m47s)

[right here right it rips through a local](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m48s)

[directory that I've just straight](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m51s)

[hardcoded grabs all the markdown files](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m52s)

[and then starts running through them I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m54s)

[added a poly retry policy because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m56s)

[tried I tried ripping through all these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h03m58s)

[files in a parallel for each uh that was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m01s)

[bad because I quickly learned that this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m04s)

[code is not thread safe I realized if I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m05s)

[had spun a separate di scope that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m09s)

[probably would have resolved it probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m11s)

[I think a lot of our stuff we registered](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m16s)

[scoped so that might that might have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m17s)

[made it go faster but when I ran it just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m19s)

[straight synchronously I actually got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m23s)

[some timeout issues hitting the database](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m25s)

[which surprised me H but this thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m28s)

[wasn't tolerant to timeouts and so after](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m30s)

[a few hours when it died it didn't retry](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m32s)

[and I'm like screw that so retry Handler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m35s)

[because darn it I don't want that to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m39s)

[happen and so then I started it today](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m40s)

[and I started running](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m43s)

[this at 11:47 a.m. basically I was like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m45s)

[hey you know time to get some lunch](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m50s)

[let's just you know kick this thing off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m52s)

[in the background that way it can be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m53s)

[processing and it's been processing and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m56s)

[processing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h04m59s)

[and processing and processing and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m00s)

[processing and hey look here we are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m03s)

[now it's night hey I mean we're almost](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m06s)

[caught up with with current time I will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m09s)

[say I mean this is definitely taking](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m12s)

[longer than I would have expected um so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m13s)

[we'll have to dig into that a little bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m16s)

[but and you can see here most of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m18s)

[files seem to take somewhere between two](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m20s)

[minutes I saw like some five and six](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m22s)

[minutes at the worst I think it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m24s)

[probably averaging a little over four](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m26s)

[minutes if I was guessing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m28s)

[like I just kind of recorded most of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m30s)

[these cuz not all of these streams are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m31s)

[the same length the files are pretty](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m33s)

[variable so depending on how long I talk](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m35s)

[and how much I talk so like some of them](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m39s)

[are really big some of them are kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m41s)

[small so yeah yeah okay and I I think I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m44s)

[kind of spot checked a handful of these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m49s)

[it seemed like the time went up based](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m50s)

[upon the size of the file so more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m52s)

[content more time and I went okay I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m54s)

[could definitely see that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h05m58s)

[and one of the other things that sell](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m00s)

[just kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m02s)

[uh off the top of my head um I believe](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m04s)

[the way that we currently have it set up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m08s)

[it's sending a individual request to the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m09s)

[majority of the like external services](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m13s)

[so specifically in this case the um the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m16s)

[A2 embedding uh endpoint um we do have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m19s)

[the availability to batch those um I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m23s)

[don't know if it's directly supported](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m26s)

[inside of Colonel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m28s)

[um kernel memory at this point but it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m30s)

[something that we could definitely look](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m32s)

[at um and then that would definitely](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m33s)

[increase your uh your throughput because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m36s)

[I think it's got a maximum of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m38s)

[hundred requests batched together in one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m41s)

[request sent to the server okay um that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m45s)

[would definitely so we could look at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m48s)

[that and overall I'm not actually too](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m49s)

[concerned with this because at the end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m52s)

[of the day I'm going to have one of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m54s)

[these a week so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h06m55s)

[Pro yeah 3 minutes worth of processing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m00s)

[once a week is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m02s)

[like like exactly now the drawback is I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m03s)

[have a small problem right now in order](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m07s)

[for us to write code I'm G to have to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m10s)

[stop this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m12s)

[execution yeah which is kind of annoying](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m14s)

[but you know what when the stream ends](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m17s)

[I'm turn it back on and go to bed so you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m19s)

[know what it can run all night now that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m21s)

[I know how long it's going to take and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m23s)

[it can run to the the other yeah the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m25s)

[other piece of that is that well first](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m28s)

[um I would be willing to bet that if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m31s)

[go back and we take a look at what's in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m33s)

[the database right now it's probably not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m35s)

[exactly what what we want it to be so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m37s)

[there's probably a little bit of changes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m39s)

[that we're going to do there any anyways](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m40s)

[so it'll probably uh force a rerun](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m42s)

[regardless um and then the second piece](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m45s)

[of that is if we get it to the if we get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m47s)

[it set up correctly it should actually](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m52s)

[pick up what you have and haven't done](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m54s)

[so you would be making a request against](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m56s)

[a file that you've already processed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h07m58s)

[with a md5 that matches or a sha that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m00s)

[matches uh what already is in there and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m04s)

[it shouldn't reprocess F says yep I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m06s)

[already got this move](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m08s)

[on yeah now we may need to look at the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m10s)

[we may need to look at our setup a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m13s)

[little bit deeper and uh go take a look](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m15s)

[at some of the docks for kernel memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m16s)

[because it's been a while since](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m18s)

[I've I as I said last week it's been a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m20s)

[while since I set up uh uh my last](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m22s)

[version of Kernel memory or the last](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m25s)

[time I worked with this just memorize](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m27s)

[everything and commit it to longterm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m29s)

[memory isn't that what colel memory is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m31s)

[you know Kevin I'm not as good as you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m34s)

[what can I say we can't all be Kevin in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m36s)

[the world so than goodness uh and in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m38s)

[fact I'm going to go one step further](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m41s)

[I'm gonna murder](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m42s)

[Casey sorry good good get me out of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m45s)

[there let's get the weather out of there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m47s)

[too dear Lord yeah wait where's the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m49s)

[weather oh you just you just removed it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m51s)

[it was it was we're going to kill this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m54s)

[too while while we're at it like there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m55s)

[there's a bunch of this stuff okay so we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h08m58s)

[have this um I did push everything I had](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m00s)

[done](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m03s)

[up uh this so if you do go so if you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m05s)

[want to see the latest code it is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m09s)

[there um for what it is worth so it has](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m11s)

[everything aside from whatever we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m15s)

[about to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m17s)

[next fantastic so here's the program Cs](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m19s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m23s)

[the the AI Services is where we did all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m24s)

[the DI registration for it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m27s)

[let's make that a little bigger for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m31s)

[people](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m32s)

[um and so this is where this is all set](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m35s)

[up and I'm going to do one thing really](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m38s)

[quick I'm going to just go like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m41s)

[this and I'm going to pop my user](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m46s)

[secrets and I'm going to put them on a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m49s)

[different](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m51s)

[Monitor and then we're going to go back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m53s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m54s)

[this just in the off chance I need to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m56s)

[in and look at one of those Secrets I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h09m59s)

[don't want it popping up on the main](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m00s)

[screen I did really good about not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m01s)

[exposing my secrets last week and I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m03s)

[shooting for two weeks in a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m05s)

[row I mean I don't know I wasn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m07s)

[watching the stream version of this but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m09s)

[I definitely saw some secrets so wasn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m11s)

[talking about what you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m13s)

[knew okay okay good good good good okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m15s)

[so last time we started building this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m18s)

[sucker up um for this and we had gone as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m20s)

[far as setting up our extra handlers um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m25s)

[and the key thing that we did was this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m28s)

[SRT markdown](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m31s)

[partitioner yep right which this guy was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m33s)

[I think a knockoff of the the teex Bas](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m36s)

[one from Colonel memory if I remember](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m39s)

[right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m41s)

[yeah uh yeah the one that originally](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m43s)

[handled both uh markdown and plain text](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m45s)

[files really bothers me that their](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m48s)

[logging is this bad but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m50s)

[whatever and then yeah we could we we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m52s)

[could change that uh change that oh oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m55s)

[you got to you got to go up your going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m58s)

[to kill me that text partitioning](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h10m59s)

[Handler as the logger create logger text](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m00s)

[partitioning Handler this is not a what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m03s)

[give me a line number 40 line 46 end of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m06s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m09s)

[line](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m12s)

[oh oh oh I see you're right this is okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m16s)

[you're right sorry I'm sitting here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m19s)

[standing there going what's wrong with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m20s)

[that right it's creating a loger with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m21s)

[the wrong category name right okay which](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m23s)

[means this guy also has the wrong](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m26s)

[logging category](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m28s)

[name yeah okay so we'll just okay that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m30s)

[killed the using so that must we clean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m33s)

[up must have been the last one okay and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m35s)

[then is this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m37s)

[guy that we're good I think well yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m40s)

[and it's it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m43s)

[is thought it was telling me it was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m46s)

[unused private member can be removed as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m48s)

[a value is never read well then what I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m50s)

[heard was burn to the ground cuz we did](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m53s)

[our own splitting down lower](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m56s)

[that count tokens okay yeah we got that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h11m59s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m02s)

[okay yeah was down here we did our own](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m03s)

[stuff and there was a handful of things](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m07s)

[in here where it was like we might not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m09s)

[need some of this like that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m11s)

[unused right uh let's see initialization](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m13s)

[can be simplified man I really should](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m17s)

[have spent some time cleaning up some of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m18s)

[these code bits because down here this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m21s)

[is where we where we had started doing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m25s)

[some of the work right where we had kind](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m27s)

[of figured out where we were going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m30s)

[chunk based on number of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m31s)

[tokens](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m34s)

[um and so we had did we already do did](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m35s)

[we already add the smarts for um pulling](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m39s)

[uh what seems like the end of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m43s)

[sentence no we did not do that don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m46s)

[have we don't have periods no we did not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m48s)

[do any sort of smarts for end of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m50s)

[sentence type stuff so for people who](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m53s)

[are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m55s)

[wondering if we go here right and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m56s)

[back back up to the root of the repo we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h12m58s)

[go subtitles suppose I could have just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m00s)

[opened one on GitHub](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m02s)

[but there is like we're parsing the this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m04s)

[text out right but this is just like the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m07s)

[subtitle tracks there are no sentences](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m10s)

[it's just a stream of Consciousness from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m12s)

[me which is terrifying at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m15s)

[times well it's interesting we could](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m19s)

[leave it that way um and then just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m22s)

[purely chunk by tokens with some smarts](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m25s)

[around at least the end of a word uh to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m29s)

[start and then uh we could go back later](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m32s)

[if we wanted to and do some end of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m35s)

[sentence stuff but that would require](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m37s)

[sending up to a GPT or another model we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m38s)

[could even do one of like the the slms](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m42s)

[um to predict uh what the end of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m45s)

[sentence would be add some periods in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m48s)

[there and then add um sentences as a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m50s)

[kind of a a delimiter for about where we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m54s)

[should be with Max tokens real quick the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m57s)

[term](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h13m59s)

[slm uh that would be a small language](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m00s)

[model um so build this year Microsoft](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m03s)

[revealed or released um information](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m07s)

[about uh slms that they've been working](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m09s)

[on I want to say it's uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m11s)

[not five there we go CH I was one letter](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m15s)

[off Chi five yeah you want to type in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m18s)

[five3 that's the magical](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m21s)

[incantation yep exactly um so they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m24s)

[revealed those uh cheaper smaller um can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m27s)

[even run on device so we could in theory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m30s)

[pull it down and run it on the machine](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m34s)

[that we're running this on maybe I mean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m36s)

[we can kind of look at it but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m38s)

[I and I already have a 53 model](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m41s)

[downloaded hypothetically speaking but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m44s)

[you're not going to be running it here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m46s)

[that's true you're going to be running](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m47s)

[it on a runner or in depending on where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m48s)

[we go whether it's a runner or a a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m52s)

[server um somewhere correct um so at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h14m54s)

[least we should work on or add in um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m00s)

[intelligent chunking with regards to uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m04s)

[end of a word we don't want to split a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m07s)

[word by grabbing 250 tokens and hitting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m09s)

[exactly in like the middle of a word](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m13s)

[because tokens as you know and I'm not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m15s)

[sure uh our guests here uh know but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m17s)

[tokens do not represent a letter nor a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m20s)

[word um they're a set of letters they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m23s)

[can be a full word they can be less than](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m26s)

[a word um um but it's really just kind](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m28s)

[of the the vocabulary if you if you will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m30s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m33s)

[llm now so I correct me if I'm wrong I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m35s)

[think with our implementation we won't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m39s)

[hit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m41s)

[midw right because we're re we're using](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m42s)

[our little Rex to pull to pull the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m44s)

[bits out right because the ma because we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m48s)

[have a a Rex that matches on the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m50s)

[text and then the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m53s)

[URL but we end up counting tokens for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m54s)

[that High](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h15m58s)

[Line and then stopping if so we're not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m00s)

[going to hit mid word because we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m03s)

[guaranteed to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m06s)

[within we're guaranteed to get either](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m08s)

[all of this or none of this now sentence](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m11s)

[and thought very possibly right but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m13s)

[we're we're going to be we're going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m16s)

[be chunking this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m18s)

[in the first line that exce 250 tokens](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m20s)

[is where we're calling it so it's not we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m24s)

[aren't chunking to 250 we're going 250](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m27s)

[plus however many tokens are in the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m29s)

[line that jumps us over so I mean each](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m31s)

[of those are going to be because isn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m34s)

[it roughly like a token to every couple](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m36s)

[characters or something to that yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m38s)

[it's it's roughly three to four tokens](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m40s)

[uh per word so and I want to say yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m45s)

[and you figure the number of words I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m48s)

[need to quit closing that file and the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m50s)

[number of words in one of these things](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m51s)

[is hey look Casey I found you uh oh what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m54s)

[do you know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h16m59s)

[yeah well I remember what we were doing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m03s)

[this one looks interesting oh this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m07s)

[2024 was this last week's 725 hey this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m08s)

[was last we this would be yeah I was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m11s)

[gonna say this this looks like last week](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m14s)

[I mean the last one before that would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m16s)

[have been](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m18s)

[2023 maybe okay and then 2021 want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m20s)

[say time before that so been on here a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m24s)

[time or two yeah so where do you where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m27s)

[do you want go next then with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m28s)

[this well let's let's go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m31s)

[look let's start by going and looking at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m34s)

[our current state in the database let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m37s)

[see what those those uh partitions um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m39s)

[look like okay um see if they are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m42s)

[starting to look better than what we had](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m45s)

[last time with like ginormous](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m48s)

[uh partitions yep let me get so PG admin](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m53s)

[Y and we'll get that fired up and let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h17m58s)

[see does it remember my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m00s)

[connection or is it going to make me oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m02s)

[look at that it remembers huzzah okay PG](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m05s)

[admin you win you win](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m09s)

[points I realize people can't see this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m11s)

[but the fact that the stupid teams bar](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m13s)

[keeps fluttering hang on I'm gonna put](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m15s)

[that over here on top of your face the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m17s)

[teams bar is the worst thing ever it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m18s)

[gonna sit on top of your face because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m20s)

[that's okay me that's not a bit of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m22s)

[screen real estate I need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m24s)

[um Okay so where do we want to go here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m27s)

[so I have is it here this km defaults in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m30s)

[my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m34s)

[tables am I place see so if you're yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m35s)

[C default under tables yep you should be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m40s)

[able to right click that and do like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m43s)

[first thousand under View and edit data](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m45s)

[uh View and edit data first 100 first](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m47s)

[100 close some of these thingies out so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m51s)

[I don't and I want to say I want to say](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m54s)

[that we also got the URL in there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m57s)

[properly last time so we should be able](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h18m59s)

[to correlate to where in the Stream](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m02s)

[properly I believe so sorry I don't know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m05s)

[which one which try this again okay it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m07s)

[okay uh apparently they've released a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m11s)

[new version since last week so I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m13s)

[covering up the little yellow bar that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m16s)

[shows it but it was notifying me that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m17s)

[apparently 8.10 is released Okay so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m20s)

[we've got all these big long vectors](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m23s)

[there was a way for me to easily](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m26s)

[collapse shrink yeah yeah so there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m29s)

[it's it's one of the few things missing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m32s)

[yeah I just want to like I don't care](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m34s)

[about this column I suppose I could](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m37s)

[select and well I mean select drop to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m39s)

[say but star okay so let's see you can't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m43s)

[do it there though uh let's see you'd](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m46s)

[have to make your own tags URL yeah so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m48s)

[in our tags we did get so for people](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m51s)

[wanting to follow along right there is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m56s)

[so I can make that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h19m59s)

[bigger right does that Zoom for you when](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m00s)

[I do that it does it is very large](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m02s)

[you're welcome yep uh so we do have the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m06s)

[URL in there so it's I mean I'm not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m09s)

[obviously not validating to make sure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m12s)

[that it's right or anything but I have a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m14s)

[URL that looks like it's correct and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m16s)

[it's got the time stamp and everything](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m17s)

[on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m19s)

[it yep that looks that looks pretty good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m20s)

[and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m24s)

[then it does have the a big long set of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m25s)

[text here so we can see roughly how big](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m30s)

[that is no that's pretty interesting if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m33s)

[you look down between line one and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m36s)

[actually really any line and line eight](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m39s)

[I want to say if you scroll to the right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m40s)

[how much how significantly shorter line8](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m43s)

[is oh so hang](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m47s)

[on oh interesting the next one must have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m50s)

[been the next one must have been really](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m53s)

[long I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m55s)

[guessing but you're right it is it is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m56s)

[significantly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h20m59s)

[shorter yeah so and that's and that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m02s)

[one of another one of those things that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m05s)

[as we kind of go through this we can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m07s)

[start looking at things like that where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m08s)

[we can optimize that to get these two](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m10s)

[closer the uh to the same length um and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m12s)

[I'll be honest with you I don't know any](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m17s)

[metrics around how much better these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m19s)

[perform uh Vector um similarity searches](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m22s)

[work if you and embeddings obviously uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m26s)

[how much better they work with um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m29s)

[similarly sized V or uh content that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m31s)

[you're turning into embeddings um but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m34s)

[it's just another thing to kind of think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m37s)

[about as we move forward and then want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m38s)

[to further optimize some of this stuff](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m41s)

[but I mean for the time being this looks](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m44s)

[pretty reasonable um yeah I me they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m46s)

[don't look ter too terribly long uh I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m49s)

[might question how much how many of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m52s)

[these are actually valuable](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m55s)

[information uh but I mean well and it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m57s)

[would have does it when when so because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h21m59s)

[I've rerun this now multiple times right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m02s)

[what is how does it choose what to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m04s)

[replace right it's based on this key](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m07s)

[here right so I feed it this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m10s)

[information right and so I fed it this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m14s)

[at the for the key because this is my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m17s)

[file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m19s)

[name right and then what where did this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m20s)

[P come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m23s)

[from I want to say that that partition](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m24s)

[is built off of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m26s)

[I'm not 100% sure we'd have to go dig in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m31s)

[the code a little bit but it's either a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m33s)

[vector or it's a good if it's a good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m35s)

[obviously it's random if it's a vector](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m36s)

[or not a vector but a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m39s)

[um a half then uh it would be the hash](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m41s)

[of the content I for some reason my head](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m45s)

[says it's the hash of the content](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m48s)

[because that's what allows you to tell](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m49s)

[when there's been an update um but part](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m51s)

[of that's also based on the the document](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m54s)

[itself and since we are um pushing these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h22m57s)

[all up as the same document I want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m00s)

[say if I'm remembering what we did last](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m02s)

[week correctly we are not splitting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m04s)

[these up per like per](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m07s)

[uh uh transcript being individual](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m10s)

[documents but I'm not 100% sure yeah so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m13s)

[for the data pipeline generate file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m16s)

[details right the ID is a new good we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m19s)

[are getting a sha 256 hash of the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m22s)

[textual data](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m26s)

[so and then the tags are where we went](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m29s)

[through and made sure that we slapped in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m31s)

[the the URL to be on top of all of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m33s)

[this and we can also uh another option](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m38s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m42s)

[and maybe we avoid this with tags but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m44s)

[the other place that you'd often put](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m48s)

[like the URL or other uh metadata like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m50s)

[that is into the payload um so back on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m52s)

[PG admin you'll see we have the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h23m57s)

[embedding we have the content and the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m00s)

[tags but we also should have a payload](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m03s)

[there and that payload is used to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m05s)

[provide like additional metadata that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m07s)

[um actually useful and not so much like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m10s)

[the tags are usually used for like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m14s)

[uh not utilized uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m17s)

[uh metadata um so like yeah you see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m21s)

[there it's got a URL um the name of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m24s)

[actual file that it comes from the last](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m27s)

[time it was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m29s)

[updated so on and so forth so hold on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m31s)

[back me up and walk me through what's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m34s)

[the difference between payload and tags](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m36s)

[then now I'm now I'm getting confused so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m38s)

[yeah you're shrinking that all right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m42s)

[perfect um so if you scroll to the left](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m44s)

[on tags I want to say that tags is more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m46s)

[uh uh it's like tags would be like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m52s)

[robust logging and payload is like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m57s)

[actual useful locking because I because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h24m59s)

[you have document ID there you have your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m02s)

[you have your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m04s)

[um uh your file part ID you have your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m05s)

[file type ID and most of that stuff](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m09s)

[you're not going to be utilizing even in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m11s)

[a downstream portion of an application](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m13s)

[that would be utilizing this data](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m15s)

[whereas the payload is going to be more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m17s)

[like the human readable human usable](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m19s)

[data](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m22s)

[um got it okay because I am noticing on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m24s)

[the tags like aside from the one I added](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m28s)

[all the built-in ones are prefixed with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m31s)

[like double underscore which my C brain](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m33s)

[immediately goes ah hands off those are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m36s)

[internal me no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m39s)

[touchy I assume that was the intended](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m40s)

[message that they were trying to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m43s)

[communicate I believe that that is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m45s)

[correct but the hard part there is the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m49s)

[payload you can't affect if and again](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m52s)

[this comes from old memory uh you can't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m55s)

[affect the payload at the level we're at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h25m57s)

[without creating uh like a custom object](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m00s)

[that you're moving forward with um ah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m04s)

[and let me let me triple check my my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m08s)

[statement there okay with my other code](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m12s)

[that I've done this because if I if I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m15s)

[look at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m17s)

[this I guess I did add the slug as a I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m20s)

[did add the slug as a tag as well and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m24s)

[think it was because I came to the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m27s)

[conclusion that getting it into the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m28s)

[payload was going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m32s)

[be somewhat](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m34s)

[difficult it really yeah Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m37s)

[really doesn't want to let me into this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m42s)

[all right I'm going to just restart my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m44s)

[visual studio it's it is angry with me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m46s)

[and I don't I don't like when visual](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m48s)

[studi is angry with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m51s)

[me usually makes for a bad time yeah I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m53s)

[mean Kenny was joking earlier that I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m55s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m57s)

[installing my visual studio and I want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h26m59s)

[you to know I resisted Kenny that little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m01s)

[red bell is sitting in the co corner and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m03s)

[I am I'm resisting the urge to click on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m06s)

[it because there is an update and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m09s)

[could grab it and I probably shouldn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m12s)

[be installing Visual Studio updates](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m14s)

[immediately on stream I've I've been](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m16s)

[trying to be good and install the visual](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m17s)

[studio updates on Thursday not when I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m19s)

[see them on Tuesday or](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m22s)

[Wednesday that way when things](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m24s)

[inevitably go wrong see I have it right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m25s)

[there and I'm not touching it I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m29s)

[letting it sit no no touchy no touchy no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m31s)

[touchy um so should we look at then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m35s)

[potentially working on speed up the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m39s)

[processing time of this or where do you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m40s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m43s)

[go you know I think I think let's leave](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m44s)

[that for now um we have options uh we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m47s)

[could we could use an external queue we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m50s)

[could use multiple workers running](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m53s)

[through this to process the actual](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m55s)

[intake um or the yeah the Ingress and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h27m57s)

[the intake but what we could do instead](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m00s)

[is we could actually build this out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m03s)

[first into a um an API so actually make](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m05s)

[it we post a a a file and it intakes the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m11s)

[file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m17s)

[or contrary to that we could proceed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m19s)

[with this with a static path and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m22s)

[could start doing some work around](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m25s)

[turning this into an action it really](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m26s)

[depends](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m27s)

[on if you want this to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m28s)

[a um a part of a pipeline like itself](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m31s)

[and then you'd have a separate uh way to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m35s)

[interact like a API to interact with the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m39s)

[memories yeah or if you want to use a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m43s)

[single API that does both Ingress and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m46s)

[egress of memories and uh we would need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m49s)

[to turn this Ingress or this ingest into](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m53s)

[an actual API end point taking files let](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h28m57s)

[me let me show you something here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m00s)

[because here's here's my here's my my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m03s)

[dirty dirty little trick idea your end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m05s)

[goal well oh I got so I had an idea](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m07s)

[because your comment there about like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m11s)

[multiple Runners and whatnot I'm like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m12s)

[you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m14s)

[know there's a there's a there's a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m15s)

[product called velop Pac that I built](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m17s)

[that um you've told me a little bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m20s)

[about yeah so so here's so here's how it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m21s)

[works well so there's a lot to it but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m24s)

[the part that we're concerned with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m26s)

[people upload files specifically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m28s)

[installers and when a file is uploaded](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m33s)

[it has to go through some processing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m36s)

[among other things AB you've got like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m39s)

[malware scans you've got um metadata](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m42s)

[processing right before the thing goes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m45s)

[live there's a little bit of stuff that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m47s)

[happens so obviously when that file is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m48s)

[uploaded it is not just immediately sent](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m50s)

[to the the go live bucket it has to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m53s)

[through some steps right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m55s)

[how you you mean you mean what crowd](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h29m58s)

[strike missed yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m00s)

[that I decided it should have some some](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m03s)

[some some safety rails up uh wise very](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m07s)

[wise because you know minimum right like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m10s)

[I I want to make sure people don't throw](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m13s)

[garbage at the system I can't prevent](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m15s)

[bad completely but I can prevent a lot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m17s)

[yeah um but the idea is so the API](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m20s)

[itself I'll just I'll just show this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m23s)

[what I could talk about it or could just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m26s)

[show it so if we go here and I go to my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m28s)

[my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m33s)

[upload right so there's this MH this guy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m34s)

[here so this is this is the upload it it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m37s)

[does some work and the the key thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m40s)

[here it puts a record in the database](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m42s)

[with some information about the file and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m44s)

[then it does this process file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m47s)

[upload which is not overly Advanced but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m49s)

[it cracks open a storage account and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m53s)

[shoves the file into to a blob right now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m56s)

[I've got multiple containers in my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h30m59s)

[storage account the the the arbitrary](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m00s)

[upload one is the wild west that's where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m03s)

[things come in but things don't go out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m05s)

[from that publicly right only internal](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m08s)

[stuff can touch it so I would presume](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m11s)

[you're using some kind of like Rings](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m13s)

[where you're you've got your you know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m15s)

[your your raw data coming in and you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m17s)

[you're curating it a little bit and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m20s)

[cleaning it up and then at the end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m21s)

[you've got something that's uh at least](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m23s)

[somewhat trustworthy uh as your right as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m26s)

[your ESS it's at least going to validate](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m29s)

[for me at at a bare minimum um but then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m31s)

[it goes and it slaps this thing so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m34s)

[storage accounts have cues on them it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m36s)

[then goes and slaps a message on the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m38s)

[Queue to say hey new file here please](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m40s)

[come process well then we get into the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m42s)

[fun area where as your container apps](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m45s)

[you can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m47s)

[spin uh a job that just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m48s)

[watches](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m52s)

[uh uh watches that Quee and says message](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m54s)

[on the Q let's start processing and more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m57s)

[importantly I can control how many uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h31m59s)

[workers are processing that queue so I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m03s)

[can chunk it as fast or as little as I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m06s)

[want so we got we got this guy here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m09s)

[which is real real bloody boring right I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m12s)

[made him](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m15s)

[boring um but the the important thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m17s)

[here is in the development environment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m19s)

[I.E Local Host when I you know F5 and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m21s)

[run I have this little Loop right where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m24s)

[it's going to sit do this do while in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m27s)

[reality the container app is going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m30s)

[spin new instances of this process and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m32s)

[it's just going to then go and process](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m34s)

[the items in the queue and do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m36s)

[work and everyone's happy right and so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m39s)

[we process the file upload](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m42s)

[so my my my sneaky little idea was you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m45s)

[know if if I was going to try to do this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m49s)

[right my thought would be we've already](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m53s)

[got a storage account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m56s)

[we create a queue in the storage account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h32m58s)

[we throw all of the files we wish this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m01s)

[system to process into the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m03s)

[queue](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m05s)

[right we put a Azure uh container app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m07s)

[monitoring said](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m11s)

[Q it spins up it processes items in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m13s)

[queue and then if I want to process](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m17s)

[everything I throw everything in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m19s)

[queue if I want to process one thing I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m20s)

[throw one thing in the queue and it just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m22s)

[goes and eats it for breakfast and it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m25s)

[makes that sound while it's doing it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m28s)

[preferably as a wave](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m29s)

[file yes that the sound is necessary now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m31s)

[what I would say is let's let's go take](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m35s)

[a look at Colonel memory real quick](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m37s)

[because oh you're going to tell me this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m39s)

[is built in I'm going to be a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m40s)

[annoyed if this is built in this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m41s)

[built in you do realize I had to write](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m43s)

[code for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m46s)

[that I mean yeah but you're you you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m47s)

[you're doing it with things that aren't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m50s)

[memories so you of course you had to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m52s)

[write code for it this is this is a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m53s)

[little bit different I mean obviously M](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m55s)

[do you mean the G repo or in yeah let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h33m58s)

[let's go take a look at the the git repo](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m01s)

[to start and go down to the memory as a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m02s)

[serverus uh asynchronous API section oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m06s)

[hold hold please I gotta I gotta like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m09s)

[get there sorry and I'm going docks just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m11s)

[straight down through the read me oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m16s)

[baby so okay so I'm an idiot I needed to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m18s)

[scoll okay synchronous memory memory is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m22s)

[a service this thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m25s)

[that thing hey you see that that that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m28s)

[beautiful ingestion cue thing it's kind](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m31s)

[of it's kind of similar to what you were](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m34s)

[just describing almost like things come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m36s)

[in they get thrown onto a queue some](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m38s)

[data gets written to a centralized](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m41s)

[storage location thingy pops off and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m43s)

[reads from the queue pulls the items out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m46s)

[of the storage and processes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m48s)

[them you know it's a little bit like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m51s)

[that it's a little bit like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m53s)

[that dang it nabit I was feeling clever](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m54s)

[uh I mean I feel good that I landed on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h34m59s)

[the right answer but that's just dumb](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m01s)

[yeah I mean I mean you are clever](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m04s)

[obviously um I mean you're thinking](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m06s)

[about the thinking about this the same](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m08s)

[way as the people that made it so I mean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m10s)

[that's good okay that means I'm not that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m11s)

[far off couple steps ahead](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m13s)

[exactly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m16s)

[so we have this built in I mean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m18s)

[obviously we'll have some configuration](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m21s)

[around it and such but this should](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m22s)

[handle uh hang you scaling](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m25s)

[horizontally uh as desired M however if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m30s)

[you're in one of these situations sorry](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m34s)

[I'm reading the rest of this and I just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m35s)

[noticed this I am importing big](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m37s)

[documents that requireing require](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m39s)

[minutes to process and I don't want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m41s)

[block the user interface](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m43s)

[oh what what user](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m45s)

[interface okay okay just they've done](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m50s)

[all the work for me dang it okay okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m54s)

[let's make some let's make some mat](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h35m59s)

[little bit a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m00s)

[bit um I'm going to assume I'm going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m03s)

[assume here and here and they're going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m05s)

[to just give me oh they've got Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m07s)

[support why do I feel like this is this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m11s)

[is the opener to a container app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m14s)

[environment being created this is this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m15s)

[is what this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m17s)

[is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m19s)

[maybe the the the beauty of the beauty](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m23s)

[of Colonel memory is if you don't have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m25s)

[that much that you need to change or if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m27s)

[you don't have really anything that you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m29s)

[need to change off of what they do by](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m30s)

[default you just run this baby as a as a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m32s)

[service you just pull their container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m35s)

[you run this container and you're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m37s)

[basically good to go all documents are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m39s)

[uploaded are automatically wait they've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m41s)

[written all the code that we've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m44s)

[written yeah but there's customizations](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m46s)

[that we needed to do they aren't they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m49s)

[aren't they're they're good with like a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m52s)

[a standard markdown or a standard text](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m54s)

[file we have a little bit of special](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m57s)

[formatting there we needed to pull off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h36m59s)

[the URL the URL is not useful in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m00s)

[embedding we need to then uh partition](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m03s)

[together all of the pieces that would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m07s)

[follow a URL rather than using like the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m09s)

[last URL of the the grouping that we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m11s)

[putting together we have there's some](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m14s)

[other intelligent stuff that we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m16s)

[having to do plus we're going to be able](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m17s)

[to then optimize our our embedding size](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m20s)

[or not our embedding size our content](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m23s)

[size and other such things um down the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m26s)

[road as well so we we definitely wanted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m28s)

[to do some of that writing I mean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m30s)

[there's some of it maybe rework but but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m32s)

[there are entire companies putting out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m35s)

[like these AI chatbot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m37s)

[models that they say oh just feed in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m39s)

[your documents and we'll give you a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m42s)

[chatbot out they can Docker run that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m43s)

[solution they can but again again and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m47s)

[and that those Solutions are really cool](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m49s)

[for the 90% case but if You' yeah but if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m52s)

[you're doing anything that's specialized](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m55s)

[if you have any kind specialized](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m56s)

[formatting or you want to do anything](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m58s)

[specific like say you're running](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h37m59s)

[markdown in and you want to be able to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m00s)

[you know you chunk through your markdown](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m03s)

[and tables you don't want to cut halfway](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m05s)

[through a table you want to use the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m07s)

[entire table that's one of your chunks](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m09s)

[or you want to get the content from your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m11s)

[table instead of the actual formatting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m13s)

[around the table and that's a chunk and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m15s)

[so there's definitely some some smart](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m18s)

[things that you have to do that are not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m21s)

[just built into kernel memory but it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m22s)

[does provide you the majority of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m24s)

[framework around orchestration of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m26s)

[for free yeah oh my word sorry I'm just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m29s)

[looking at what they have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m32s)

[here oh yeah like again this is this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m35s)

[is they could not have made this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m41s)

[easy Kevin Kevin we were at build and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m43s)

[wanted to meet devis this is why I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m47s)

[wanted to meet devis he he built the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m49s)

[majority of this from my understanding](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m52s)

[and uh did a lot of the architecture](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m54s)

[here uh they they've done a really good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m56s)

[job with this I I I do not think they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h38m58s)

[could have made this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m00s)

[easier no like trying to imagine how you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m02s)

[make this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m05s)

[easier I mean Docker run you have to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m06s)

[give it a key so that it knows what to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m10s)

[do as an environment variable you have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m12s)

[to expose a port so that you can you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m14s)

[know get to it and then you're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m16s)

[done right I believe it is interactive](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m20s)

[terminal and the- RM is to let you uh n](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m23s)

[rerun I believe](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m27s)

[but yeah that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m29s)

[insane and they're giving us all they're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m32s)

[giving us the docker file so as we as it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m34s)

[says on that first line under Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m37s)

[support you can use the docker file in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m38s)

[the repo for custom builds what do you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m40s)

[know that's us custom](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m43s)

[build holy cow I know I know you like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m48s)

[building things but I like using](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m52s)

[people's things and building a tiny bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m54s)

[on top of them I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m56s)

[make my life easy yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h39m59s)

[that yeah okay wow sorry I'm just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m07s)

[looking at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m11s)

[this uh oh R Izzy's pointing out RM is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m12s)

[remove on exit thank you Izzy I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m15s)

[remembered it was something about being](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m17s)

[able to to basically hit up Arrow enter](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m18s)

[repeatedly from my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m21s)

[terminal um okay cool](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m24s)

[sorry I'm just reading through this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m28s)

[Docker file to see exactly what they're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m29s)

[doing hey look at that hey look there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m32s)

[man himself there there is so when you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m34s)

[said deis may have had something to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m37s)

[with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m38s)

[this I think I think this this one here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m39s)

[would strongly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m43s)

[indicate um yeah does it have service](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m44s)

[Discovery built](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m47s)

[in I don't I don't think so but it looks](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m49s)

[like a standard ASP core app so with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m52s)

[short version it would not be hard](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m55s)

[would not be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m58s)

[hard um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h40m59s)

[okay so how do you propose we proceed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m02s)

[then what do what do you want me to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m05s)

[do you want me just to spin a I mean I I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m07s)

[come back to the original question do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m10s)

[you want to run this as in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m12s)

[pipeline synchronous or do you want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m14s)

[run this as a service external and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m16s)

[just you know make requests and it cues](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m18s)

[up and it runs this good stuff dang na](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m21s)

[it let's do the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m23s)

[service that's the right answer](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m25s)

[H so why were you asking if there was a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m27s)

[right answer you can just tell me what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m29s)

[the right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m31s)

[answer because because because I'm not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m32s)

[paying for this you are I well I mean I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m35s)

[mean kind of Microsoft is paying for it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m38s)

[these are these are my msdn credits that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m41s)

[are used for plane and this is at this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m43s)

[point this is definitely](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m45s)

[plane uh I'm sorry what the heck is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m47s)

[this that is a new service I have not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m52s)

[seen](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m54s)

[uh yeah so we're just gonna we're just G](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h41m57s)

[to add that to favorites and we'll come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m01s)

[back to that later because wait wait](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m03s)

[wait go back real quick I want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m05s)

[there's a real there's a piece that I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m08s)

[want to read real quick](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m09s)

[that on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m11s)

[here right at the end there they are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m13s)

[ideal ideal for safely running untrusted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m16s)

[codes such as user provided scripts or](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m19s)

[code that is generated by](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m22s)

[llms okay I mean that kind of makes this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m24s)

[so this is what we use as the back end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m28s)

[if we want to add code running to a uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m29s)

[as a skill for an llm okay correct so so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m32s)

[hypothetically if if a website like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m35s)

[essential C wanted to hypothetically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m37s)

[have a little code runner for like being](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m41s)

[able to execute the code samples we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m44s)

[might use something like that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m46s)

[hypothetically be pretty it would be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m49s)

[pretty cool hang on I got to check yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m51s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h42m58s)

[just hypothetical](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m02s)

[hypothetical okay so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m08s)

[with a regular container app I M A](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m10s)

[thinks uh Misa agrees uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m15s)

[is not the right thing we're going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m18s)

[here and I'm going to steal this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m22s)

[container image now beautiful name how](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m25s)

[do we how do we are we going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m27s)

[customize the image or do you just want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m29s)

[me to pull their image straight off a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m30s)

[Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m32s)

[Hub because they've got it we got so you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m33s)

[want me to do a custom version of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m36s)

[yeah I mean if we're going to get our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m41s)

[pieces into there I think we have to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m44s)

[right unless I'm mistaken I you are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m46s)

[correct I just like I could literally](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m48s)

[just do this so like cuz a container app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m51s)

[is like having a Docker run in the cloud](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m54s)

[like I can just point it and say go and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h43m58s)

[it then go no I think region Australia](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m02s)

[East I heard the no we want to we want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m05s)

[to I'm in the west coast us let's let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m08s)

[go be close to me uh container app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m10s)

[environment no I would like to make my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m13s)

[own environment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m15s)

[please and it will be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m18s)

[called uh let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m21s)

[see uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m24s)

[yeah we're going to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m27s)

[there consumption yeah uh will be Zone](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m28s)

[redundant we don't need Zone redundancy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m32s)

[this is not the type of thing that I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m34s)

[care](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m36s)

[about doing this we'll turn off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m37s)

[logs streaming's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m41s)

[fine use your own v-net](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m43s)

[nah make me a v-net okay we got that got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m46s)

[that got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m51s)

[that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m52s)

[um I wonder what I I I wonder if it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m55s)

[going to let me spin this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h44m58s)

[without I don't think it allows you to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m02s)

[spin without an image so we need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m05s)

[create the registry and oh you're right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m07s)

[I have to have a registry and all that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m10s)

[stuff um hang on here's what we're going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m13s)

[to do we're GNA point it at this for the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m16s)

[moment and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m19s)

[in the other stuff as we as we get there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m26s)

[okay so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m28s)

[that command](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m33s)

[override ye](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m35s)

[tiny don't need any](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m37s)

[bindings I'm going to leave Ingress off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m39s)

[we're going to want it but I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m42s)

[really want to spin this right now and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h45m44s)

[yeah Keys end points Keys it can be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m33s)

[dead container I just want the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m36s)

[infrastructure up for the moment uh it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m38s)

[not just that it can be a dead container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m42s)

[it will be a dead](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m43s)

[container uh standby I'm gonna move this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m45s)

[over to here and I'm going to do this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m47s)

[and I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m50s)

[this how is that teams thing always on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m53s)

[top of what I want to click](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h46m57s)

[on it's literally always in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m00s)

[way I don't know I don't know how it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m02s)

[manages to pull that off okay so let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m04s)

[see we need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m07s)

[container regist no dang it I saw](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m09s)

[it stop it help stop helping me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m14s)

[container registry I need one of these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m18s)

[give me create create give me uh let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m20s)

[see there is only one name I'm going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m25s)

[be really disappointed if at some point](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m27s)

[we get into a situation where somebody](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m29s)

[beats me to one of these names so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m30s)

[everybody watching please do not hose](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m32s)

[me uh let's see that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m36s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m39s)

[yep I mean in theory I would terraform](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m41s)

[all this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m43s)

[but we'll send this okay deployment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m45s)

[complete go to Resource you are probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m48s)

[correct that if we go and look at our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m51s)

[container it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m53s)

[probably unhappy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m54s)

[it should be it should be um also I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h47m58s)

[forgot about this but I'll post it into](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m03s)

[the stream chat here um for those of you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m06s)

[that are familiar with um semantic](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m09s)

[memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m12s)

[uh and semantic kernel which uses](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m14s)

[semantic memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m17s)

[um and want to know the differences or](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m19s)

[some of the the uh improvements that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m22s)

[have been made to Kernel memory um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m24s)

[lessons learned that were taken from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m27s)

[building out sematic kernel and semantic](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m29s)

[memory uh here's a nice chart that kind](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m30s)

[of gives you your table that gives you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m33s)

[some of the differences between the two](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m36s)

[um kind of kind of fun gives you some](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m38s)

[some interesting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m42s)

[Insight on that is also going to go sit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m44s)

[over here on my my pending list okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m47s)

[okay so we've got container registry is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m51s)

[up uh yeah we are we are definitely in a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h48m55s)

[a dead](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m00s)

[zone in terms](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m02s)

[of to be to be expected container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m05s)

[crashing what a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m08s)

[shock well given that we didn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m09s)

[configure it properly I suppose crashing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m11s)

[is the most expected outcome but you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m13s)

[know what it's stood](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m15s)

[up okay so now we need to do something](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m18s)

[to take their happiness make an image](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m21s)

[put it in the container registry Bippity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m24s)

[bity boo y](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m25s)

[right turn it into our happiness exactly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m27s)

[so I have this but I assume what you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m30s)

[want me to do is grab their Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m32s)

[file that correct yes because I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m34s)

[we're going to need to grab their dock](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m39s)

[fire file yes I think it'll at least](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m41s)

[make our lives easier we don't have to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m44s)

[build our own yeah I mean I'm GNA have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m45s)

[to tweak some of this a little bit but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m45s)

[we're oh of course of course we're going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m48s)

[to make it we're going to make it happen](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m50s)

[so give me one second that's a good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m52s)

[starting point uh let's see I got to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m54s)

[to the right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h49m57s)

[folder okay and then we go let's see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m00s)

[nope nope I put it under AI here and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m04s)

[wish it wouldn't do txt bad GitHub](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m08s)

[um because last I checked that's what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m13s)

[dark file looks](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m16s)

[like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m18s)

[huzzah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m20s)

[okay ah beautiful formatting yep so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m22s)

[let's see they are running net 80 for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m24s)

[Jammy for build Alpine for running great](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m28s)

[great](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m31s)

[great uh they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m32s)

[have okay sorry just reading this um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m40s)

[okay so first things first we're going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m43s)

[to need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m46s)

[adjust where this is some pathing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m48s)

[because the question is is where do you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m51s)

[want to run the docker build command](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m53s)

[from right because I'm going to get a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m55s)

[get me a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m57s)

[terminal I want a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h50m59s)

[terminal right and I'm kind of thinking](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m05s)

[that we might](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m08s)

[just so for people unfamiliar with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m10s)

[Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m12s)

[the uh see CD AI right then we go nope](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m13s)

[that ain't it try](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m19s)

[again uh let's see Docker build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m22s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m27s)

[then as long as you're in the directory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m29s)

[with the doer file it should find it the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m31s)

[period very very very important but I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m33s)

[expect this to fail here in a moment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m35s)

[because even though it'll be able to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m37s)

[pull the base](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m39s)

[images once it gets around to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m41s)

[actually building the app we we will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m45s)

[have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m47s)

[problems like for example build run](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m52s)

[thing right because it it copied in from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m55s)

[the working](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m58s)

[directory or into the current directory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h51m59s)

[from SRC but that isn't going to fly so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m02s)

[I think what we can do let's see if I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m05s)

[can get my path in correct wait this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m07s)

[copy current directory into](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m09s)

[SRC that's fine M current directory is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m12s)

[not going to be this it's going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m15s)

[be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m19s)

[kaboo bot API bot right and then it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m23s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m27s)

[beot API](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m30s)

[CSR and then same thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m34s)

[here okay let's go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m44s)

[here uh let's see what did I do wrong](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m49s)

[here this is this is where I'm going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m52s)

[get my pathing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m53s)

[wrong oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m55s)

[I think it's because you're still one to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h52m57s)

[uh too high you're right because my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m00s)

[directory is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m02s)

[down right if your Docker file was a was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m05s)

[a step up it would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m08s)

[be well you secretly though so here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m11s)

[let's do this Docker build but I will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m14s)

[do uh do dot no I'm I'm now my working](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m18s)

[directory is one level up so my DOT my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m22s)

[context is set one level higher above my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m24s)

[Pro project and then we go um darker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m26s)

[file like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m31s)

[that see now it's hitting the net build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m35s)

[properly this is one of the things like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m40s)

[the pathing and Docker always gets me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m42s)

[right because it's it's so much is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m45s)

[hinging upon your context and really](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m47s)

[running a Docker build like this from an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m49s)

[arbitrary directory like I feel like the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m51s)

[two patterns I see is you run it from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m53s)

[the the working Direct directory of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m55s)

[project or you run it from the the route](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m57s)

[of the repo everything else is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h53m59s)

[considered weird or awkward yeah so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m01s)

[naturally I've landed on one of the only](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m06s)

[things I would consider](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m08s)

[wrong uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m11s)

[okay uh naturally okay so we got an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m12s)

[image we got it up Bippity bity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m15s)

[booya uh let's see we should have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m19s)

[probably tagged it right uh yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m22s)

[I think T is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m27s)

[kaboot uh let's see doer is it LS no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m30s)

[what what is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m35s)

[the there's I I I'm about ready just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m37s)

[open doer desktop because I can't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m40s)

[remember these commands](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m42s)

[uh load kill](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m46s)

[inspect I I want to list my my images to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m51s)

[run them oh there that's what I'm oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m55s)

[yeah images](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h54m58s)

[yeah it's always the simplest thing you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m02s)

[can think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m04s)

[of also holy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m06s)

[moly oh it's SQL Server that's why it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m09s)

[so big I was like a 1.5 gig image dang](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m11s)

[yeah makes more sense though well let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m15s)

[just say that would be for velop](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m18s)

[pack do run nice](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m22s)

[right so this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m27s)

[should well command cannot be loaded](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m29s)

[because you intended to execute a net](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m31s)

[application Microsoft konel Member](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m35s)

[Service assembly does not exist you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m37s)

[intended to execute so hang on what is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m39s)

[the execution command well okay so it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m41s)

[trying to Run net Microsoft konel memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m44s)

[service assembly that is probably not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m47s)

[going to work needs to change so that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m49s)

[that's a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m52s)

[problem because if you try to net run](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m53s)

[something that's not there it no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m56s)

[worky go back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h55m59s)

[here seems reasonable I mean I'm an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m01s)

[amateur](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m10s)

[so I will say at some point if we get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m14s)

[this working I may want to go back and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m18s)

[redo this because this um net publish](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m20s)

[has support for building images without](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m24s)

[needing doer](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m26s)

[files yeah really you can just configure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m28s)

[up your CS Pro and the cool thing about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m31s)

[that is that means you can ship like a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m34s)

[props or a targets file in a nougat](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m36s)

[package and be Off to the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m38s)

[Races so you can you can get the power](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m41s)

[of Ms build inside of a Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m44s)

[file which is kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m47s)

[weird because it means the MS build step](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m50s)

[does the equivalent of generating the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m52s)

[docker file then does the docker build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m54s)

[onto it so you can like you can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m55s)

[configure Ms build properties to muck](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h56m57s)

[with that generator that then's going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m00s)

[get built and so you can have it you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m02s)

[know pull your project name do all kinds](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m04s)

[of fky](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m05s)

[stuff things interesting I want to abuse](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m08s)

[okay does that work is that a is that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m12s)

[working as a a c generator under the no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m17s)

[so it's Ms build uh and uh net SDK magic](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m19s)

[so you have to be trying remember I I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m24s)

[think I think you have to be 80 it might](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m28s)

[work in seven I don't remember I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m31s)

[it may have been introduced in seven but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m33s)

[80 they finally added in extra stuff](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m35s)

[like running as non-root user and other](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m37s)

[things if I'm remembering](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m39s)

[properly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m41s)

[um and there there are obviously](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m42s)

[limitations to it because you can do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m45s)

[whatever you want in a Docker file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m47s)

[obviously the MS build stuff there you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m49s)

[you don't have quite the same level](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m51s)

[power but most of the time you don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m53s)

[need it yeah not the same flexibility it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m54s)

[would makes sense okay so if fired up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h57m58s)

[listened on ports set it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m00s)

[up it's rocking if I had actually](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m02s)

[forwarded ports we could](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m05s)

[have ped against it Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m07s)

[on a Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m27s)

[Supply which is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m29s)

[wonderful I mean I mean I call a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m31s)

[Mountain Dew Supply the supermarket but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m34s)

[I mean sure yes but who supplies it to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m37s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m39s)

[supermarket are you going straight to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m40s)

[the distributor you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m41s)

[madman how much you buying what are you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m43s)

[what are you are are you ordering a like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m46s)

[a a shipping container full of mountain](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m48s)

[do here sir no I was limited I was told](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m50s)

[there was a maximum not a minimum](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m52s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m57s)

[Lordy okay great so we've got what I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h58m58s)

[think is probably close-ish to a working](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m01s)

[system I mean sweet we could go through](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m04s)

[and I guess we could test this really](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m08s)

[quick right I mean if you run it we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m10s)

[should be able to go and see the uh well](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m11s)

[the API endpoint right well yeah but I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m14s)

[I'm GNA just do this real quick just so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m18s)

[we have something to hit right and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m19s)

[because the the only problem is is I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m22s)

[didn't when I launched it didn't bind](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m24s)

[the port so like in their](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m26s)

[docks they got the nine yeah well it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m29s)

[one you basically you got to do this to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m34s)

[say thing on outside forward to port on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m36s)

[inside because if you're listening to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m38s)

[Port 901 inside that doesn't do any good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m40s)

[yeah it's kind of like those hotel rooms](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m45s)

[where they've got the doors on both](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m46s)

[sides if you only open one of them you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m48s)

[can't walk through the doorway the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m51s)

[shared room those things are so fun](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m53s)

[funny like I I don't see those anymore](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m56s)

[but the old hotels that had like the you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=00h59m58s)

[could turn one or two rooms into one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m00s)

[those are definitely interesting yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m02s)

[yeah exactly it's it's basically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m05s)

[that um I like that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m08s)

[analogy yeah door on left door on right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m11s)

[okay so now that's now that's up and now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m15s)

[I should be able to just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m17s)

[go uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m24s)

[I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m27s)

[think connection refused I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m30s)

[remember what is the magical incantation](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m33s)

[okay I give](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m35s)

[up where is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m36s)

[my I mean you should be able to do slash](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m39s)

[Health right because you mapped it oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m42s)

[that's a good](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m44s)

[point I'm just trying to remember if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m46s)

[Local Host is the right host address for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m49s)

[it because there's a very real chance](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m52s)

[that I have the wrong host](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m54s)

[the wrong](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m57s)

[01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,400](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h00m59s)

maybe uh

[yes but like so for example if we if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m04s)

[go here right and or is it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m07s)

[the it's so funny](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m13s)

[I I do not use Docker desktop ever why](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m16s)

[does it show no ports](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m20s)

[bound that's seems wrong to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m24s)

[me oh did I get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m28s)

[my think I got my I if I okay hang on if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m32s)

[I remember the the order of execution](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m37s)

[matters](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m39s)

[here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m40s)

[um yeah so we W yeah so you want to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m43s)

[so it's almost like it's almost like the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m47s)

[people who wrote this knew what they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m49s)

[were](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m50s)

[doing right uh yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m52s)

[and now I should see now we have bound](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h01m58s)

[ports that does look more uh right more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m02s)

[happy that looks that that looks like we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m06s)

[should and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m10s)

[then hey there we go that's what I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m13s)

[talking about so I have it working now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m17s)

[obviously there is some problems with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m22s)

[our setup uh I'm going to close uh most](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m24s)

[notably the fact that my enumerate files](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m27s)

[uh that ain't going to work inside a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m31s)

[container Dam that ain't gonna fly yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m32s)

[yeah that that that no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m35s)

[working so we're going to need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m37s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m40s)

[honestly we wanted to we could pull](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m42s)

[straight off a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m44s)

[gith right public repo I mean HTTP](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m45s)

[client get a string rip down the files](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m49s)

[Bippity poy boo yeah done right cuz I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m53s)

[could feed in we could I could feed in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m55s)

[the file name and the root of all of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m57s)

[these things is going to be oo o I like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h02m59s)

[that because the I like that the root of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m03s)

[all yeah you're if you go here and you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m05s)

[go now you might get rate limited if you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m08s)

[if we pound on it too hard but yeah I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m11s)

[can prefix that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m14s)

[URL yeah with any markdown file name I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m16s)

[want and I can just pull the string and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m19s)

[poof I got my mark down right oh your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m22s)

[uncle yep](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m25s)

[so I like that and it's also simpler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m28s)

[than doing a real file upload yeah like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m31s)

[that okay I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m35s)

[gonna with name do stuff uh inest that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m40s)

[that's that's the funny one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m45s)

[um uh that's what we should do a j for a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m49s)

[single file uh how about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m52s)

[process file all right we're going to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m57s)

[this will be the singular one and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h03m59s)

[will do process](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m02s)

[file file name something like that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m04s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m09s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m11s)

[then rather than this uh I would like to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m14s)

[do uh Builder](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m19s)

[Services uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m24s)

[add HTTP client and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m28s)

[go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m31s)

[with from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m33s)

[Services HTTP](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m36s)

[client client yes I am fully aware that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m39s)

[there are ways to optimize this base URL](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m42s)

[shared blah blah blah blah blah do I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m44s)

[care no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m46s)

[um bring base URL gets](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m49s)

[to and then did I copy it no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m53s)

[that would have been smart and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m56s)

[straightforward and right to the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m57s)

[point we just want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h04m59s)

[that right so in this case this is going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m02s)

[to be a real real](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m04s)

[simple uh actually through that we'll](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m07s)

[just do uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m10s)

[U file U gets](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m14s)

[new and then we will just literally slap](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m19s)

[that sucker in file name](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m22s)

[and then I like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m26s)

[it right and then we are going to not do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m30s)

[any of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m33s)

[stuff all I'm just looking to see what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m35s)

[the what the thing was because we just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m38s)

[need to open a stream to it it looks](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m41s)

[like so I I just need to change this up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m43s)

[a little bit so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m46s)

[client uh get stream](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m49s)

[async uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m54s)

[uh why don't I don't know why co-pilot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m57s)

[has been on this continue with kick](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h05m59s)

[knock it off co-pilot I'm not writing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m01s)

[code that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m03s)

[way stop it using bar file stream gets](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m05s)

[wait right we'll make this stream I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m11s)

[don't know file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m14s)

[stream I don't like that implies local](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m16s)

[file markdown stream](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m19s)

[better uh we are not going to do a retry](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m20s)

[policy on this one since it's a single](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m23s)

[file scre](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m24s)

[that uh let's see await uh process file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m26s)

[you know what if we're just doing a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m31s)

[single one we don't need a separate](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m32s)

[function we're just going to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m34s)

[this uh let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m37s)

[to see this work first and get this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m51s)

[published and then worry about the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m53s)

[actual services](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m54s)

[bits uh let's just do let's do it all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h06m57s)

[well I mean so I'm going to so this will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m03s)

[this will work right like um markdown](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m06s)

[stream yep and we're going to do file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m10s)

[name right we should probably uh to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m12s)

[handle bad](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m18s)

[input because right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m20s)

[now what's validation who cares about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m23s)

[viation I mean the nice thing here is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m28s)

[that I mean with the exception of it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m30s)

[blow screwing it up at the yeah yeah I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m33s)

[mean us screwing up at the beginning I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m35s)

[mean you shouldn't have much bad input](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m37s)

[because you're going to be only](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m40s)

[requesting from a known source yeah but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m41s)

[there's also things like I might want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m43s)

[put some rate limiting and whatnot on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m45s)

[here so that somebody doesn't just pound](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m46s)

[this API to Oblivion that sounds bad to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m48s)

[me but nobody can bound it to Oblivion](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m51s)

[except for you uh well once publish](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m53s)

[it give me a moment you seem to think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h07m57s)

[I can publish stuff real](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m05s)

[I don't know if I can agree with that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m21s)

[one without thinking about it deeply for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m22s)

[a little while I I I got to think about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m24s)

[that one for a bit I mean there I guess](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m26s)

[I suppose there is an argument to me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m28s)

[made that if you like gained learning or](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m29s)

[something along the way it doesn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m31s)

[matter that you didn't ship but but well](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m32s)

[and I mean I mean if you created so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m35s)

[let's say let's go with the you know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m37s)

[we're on the AI kick here let's say you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m39s)

[created uh you know the true super](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m41s)

[of uh all the all the fearmongers would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m46s)

[uh destroy everyone I mean maybe it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m48s)

[more valuable that you didn't ship it h](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m52s)

[Maybe I mean I suppose that's true so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m55s)

[you are positing if I build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h08m58s)

[Skynet and you didn't ship it it's more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m01s)

[valuable that you didn't ship it than](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m03s)

[you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m04s)

[did I mean that that okay there is an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m05s)

[argument to be made](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m08s)

[there uh let's see well it blew up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m10s)

[immediately uh let's see inest](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m16s)

[found endpoint names must be globally](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m19s)

[unique so it turns out ah yes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m21s)

[that that can be a problem](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m26s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m28s)

[uh I mean in retrospect I probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m30s)

[should be like deving in the container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m32s)

[rather than doing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m36s)

[this weird local publish process I me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m37s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m40s)

[but details I just have all this faith](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m43s)

[that it's going to work perfectly the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m46s)

[first time without a lot of thinking](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m47s)

[involved you know and if you if you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m49s)

[press go enough it usually does yeah I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m52s)

[mean I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m54s)

[like I suppose we could test by like you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m56s)

[know pressing F5 that would be one that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h09m58s)

[would have been one way to catch this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m01s)

[bug a little bit earlier and just verify](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m02s)

[that the code](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m04s)

[Works immediately for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m06s)

[me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m09s)

[yeah see how long the build takes when](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m12s)

[I've got two things trying to build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m15s)

[simultaneously there's no way that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m16s)

[causes any problems](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m18s)

[whatsoever totally fine except for one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m20s)

[one's building in release mode one's in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m22s)

[debug so oh who's going to win who's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m24s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m27s)

[win](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m29s)

[refresh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m31s)

[500 oh oh the other one caught](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m35s)

[up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m39s)

[uh so it turns out my my user Secrets](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m43s)

[aren't being published into the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m46s)

[Container which um means that it um no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m48s)

[worky but yep if I go here this guy is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m51s)

[running in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m56s)

[Windows if we look at uh let's see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h10m58s)

[specified method is not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m03s)

[supported let's see here what do we do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m05s)

[uh pipeline base orchestrator oh it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m08s)

[doesn't like me pulling in arbitrary um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m11s)

[length strings well it so it's trying to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m15s)

[call it's trying to call do length on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m18s)

[the stream M and the stream from an HTTP](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m21s)

[client is basically forward](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m24s)

[only and so it doesn't know the length](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m26s)

[in these cases](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m29s)

[so let's uh let's change this code up a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m32s)

[little bit here we we'll get this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m35s)

[working in Windows and then we'll deal](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m37s)

[with the fact that it no working in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m39s)

[container um which is probably so let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m41s)

[just do get string right like we could](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m44s)

[copy into a memory stream if we wanted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m47s)

[to but I don't know if that's I guess we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m49s)

[are going to end up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m52s)

[uh doing this a little bit using](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h11m59s)

[stream uh gets new memory stream oh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m06s)

[sorry sorry co-pilot I apologize for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m11s)

[cutting you off I think you had it right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m13s)

[the first time please don't fire](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m14s)

[me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m20s)

[uh okay so that should that should fix](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m22s)

[at least that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m25s)

[problem at some point it might be nice](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m28s)

[to figure out a a cleaner solution](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m30s)

[rather than just blind copying the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m32s)

[entire data in but you know what me yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m34s)

[yeah that's not going to be the slow](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m37s)

[part no like I don't at least I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m40s)

[think it'll](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m42s)

[be yeah because it it jumped in because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m44s)

[let's see the the time stamp did it did](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m48s)

[it time stamp it on the way in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m51s)

[uh I wish you uh the console logger](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m55s)

[doesn't log time stamps and I wish it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m58s)

[did whatever the time was between here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h12m59s)

[and here was the amount of time it took](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m02s)

[to download from GitHub and store it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m03s)

[into a memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m05s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m07s)

[oh it's thinking so that's probably a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m09s)

[good thing I I just realized something](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m12s)

[that's probably wrong in our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m13s)

[code what is that um after we copy into](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m15s)

[the memory stream the position on the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m19s)

[memory stream is going to be at the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m21s)

[end yeah so that's yeah that's true but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m23s)

[this thing is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m26s)

[thinking which gives me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m28s)

[pause](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m31s)

[um application is shutting down yeah I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m33s)

[told it to stop oh I was like wait a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m36s)

[second but the thing is is you I gave it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m41s)

[a graceful shutdown but it it would it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m44s)

[would give um a timeout period](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m46s)

[for uh the Handler to finish executing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m50s)

[the thing is the Handler might run for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m53s)

[several minutes so this is the this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m55s)

[the other drawback is I don't have a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m57s)

[tiny file out there so it's uh uh yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h13m59s)

[not out there you don't you have the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m03s)

[tiny file the tiny file locally I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m05s)

[think I pushed that I hope I didn't push](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m07s)

[that I don't think you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m09s)

[did if you did I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m11s)

[laugh well hello there well hello there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m20s)

[my little friend my friend I mean that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m22s)

[literally in this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m26s)

[case uh hold hold please hold please](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m28s)

[we're just going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m32s)

[double check this because I I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m33s)

[I oh yep yep that that top one is too](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m36s)

[isn't it no it's this one is the tiny](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m39s)

[one see I can scroll down and I can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m42s)

[reach the bottom in a sane period of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m44s)

[time so we're just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m46s)

[gonna ah grab that sucker and we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m47s)

[going to come back over to here uh we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m51s)

[going to cancel this this try it out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m54s)

[again oh it's going to hold this hang on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h14m56s)

[refresh there we go break](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m01s)

[execution](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m05s)

[now be a good example of running things](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m07s)

[in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m09s)

[parallel done processing file in 8](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m14s)

[seconds memory is the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m17s)

[key](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m20s)

[beautiful I love it that's what a 200](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m22s)

[looks like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m24s)

[friend oh yeah so we have that guy going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m25s)

[oh yeah um okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m28s)

[now what do you want me to do next we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m31s)

[can look at getting this all the way](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m34s)

[published or we can look at trying to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m35s)

[pipeline you this thing with like the Q](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m38s)

[and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m41s)

[stuff yeah I mean if we're going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m44s)

[Garner the benefit of doing this as a q](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m46s)

[we should probably set up the que](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m49s)

[okay or else we might as well have just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m51s)

[done it in in process yeah so do they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m54s)

[have docs on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h15m58s)

[that I believe so um go to Doc because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m01s)

[like the way I would do is I'd be going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m06s)

[to my storage account spending a queue](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m07s)

[and blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m09s)

[blah right and I see they've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m11s)

[got not what I want that's not what I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m14s)

[want server](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m17s)

[less because I think what I what I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m20s)

[going to do in terms of publishing out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m23s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m25s)

[secrets is I think I'm just going to set](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m26s)

[them up as environment variables on my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m28s)

[container app and call it a day like I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m30s)

[normally you'd map them with a key Vault](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m32s)

[and all that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m33s)

[just that's that's that's more coding](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m35s)

[and I got to set up a key Vault the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m38s)

[managed identity and oh oh the the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m39s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m44s)

[troubles yeah so because this is this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m45s)

[theirs Handler they have a nice setup](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m51s)

[here for all of that default](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m54s)

[pipeline but I guess that's what I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h16m58s)

[what I'm wondering about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m00s)

[is they've got this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m03s)

[service which has all this stuff and I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m08s)

[kind of wondering if the if the expected](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m12s)

[idea was that you bring in all of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m15s)

[stuff and use this as a starting point](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m18s)

[for your](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m21s)

[projects all right because it looks like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m23s)

[they've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m26s)

[got all of these extensions that are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m28s)

[using minimal apis see minimal apis are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m31s)

[good h no no no no no see minimal](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m34s)

[apis I know I know I'm just not on the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m40s)

[worry we'll fix you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m45s)

[um um so docks wise um I mean yes there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m49s)

[should be some docs but um uh no there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m54s)

[isn't docs I mean so you go under under](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h17m57s)

[only just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m07s)

[started um let's look here because it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m09s)

[seems like this service ASP net core](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m12s)

[like this guy here I bet you this is a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m14s)

[nougat package I bet you this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m17s)

[published as a nougat package I think we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m20s)

[already have that nougat package do we I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m22s)

[think so I think we pulled that bad boy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m25s)

[in already I could be wrong but if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m27s)

[don't we we're about to add it so let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m30s)

[uh DN](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m33s)

[street because stre this guy here now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m35s)

[that I understand what he is he comes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m39s)

[with all the extensions to automatically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m41s)

[gen your end](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m43s)

[points look at that D](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m45s)

[it's so so here so here's the thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m48s)

[right like inside of here this guy has a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m52s)

[bunch of extensions add kernel memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m55s)

[end points like you call this method](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h19m57s)

[it's GNA do work so hang on like and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m01s)

[we've already built out if we want to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m06s)

[all the things we literally come up here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m07s)

[and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m10s)

[do I think we just do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m11s)

[Builder this maneuver](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m14s)

[right yep that using statement uh hold](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m17s)

[up web application Builder web](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m21s)

[application build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m24s)

[app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m29s)

[ah I think it looks something like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m33s)

[that it might it might look something](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m36s)

[like that let me just kind of briefly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m39s)

[scan this because all of these other](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m41s)

[ones look to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m43s)

[be CU it's got the top level method](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m45s)

[that's add all the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m47s)

[things then it's got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m49s)

[the individual ones around it okay let](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m51s)

[me look here and then there's the add](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m55s)

[kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m58s)

[memory but all this entire thing here is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h20m59s)

[just to do an ad Singleton for an i](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m03s)

[kernel memory but I think we already](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m05s)

[have that with our add AI Services](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m09s)

[because I believe we are adding in our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m13s)

[own kernel memory so I don't think we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m15s)

[want we to because we're yeah and we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m17s)

[need to do that because we're defining](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m20s)

[all of our own uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m21s)

[handlers uh did you mean to register the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m29s)

[unknown parameters as a service I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m32s)

[sorry huh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m34s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m37s)

[see create](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m46s)

[arguments query body](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m48s)

[inferred invalid oper failure to for one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m51s)

[or more parameters below is the list of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m54s)

[the parameters that we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m56s)

[found context provider so something has](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h21m59s)

[a context](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m03s)

[provider and I don't know which one of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m06s)

[these okay so hang on maybe we dial this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m08s)

[sucker down a little bit so just to make](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m10s)

[sure I get rid of you problem go away](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m12s)

[right problem go away I'm I'm going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m16s)

[assume that that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m19s)

[the okay yeah so that so one of the guys](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m20s)

[that this guy is adding in is ye problem](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m24s)

[for us we go here we go here we don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m27s)

[act do we want all of these because we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m31s)

[can probably find we could probably find](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m35s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m37s)

[the realistically all we want is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m39s)

[provider this guy there's context](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m44s)

[provider we can I can probably narrow](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m49s)

[down post upload endpoint need needs to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m51s)

[it uh that's the same thing what we got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m55s)

[down here uh the ask Endo wants an eye](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h22m59s)

[context](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m02s)

[provider well and we don't need the ask](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m04s)

[endpoint yet yeah because we're not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m06s)

[we're not requesting anything back from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m09s)

[the memories at this point we just need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m11s)

[I think the upload um end point I'm just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m15s)

[curious real quick what they register](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m18s)

[here because they must register](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m21s)

[something to have that ready to rock](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m23s)

[right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m27s)

[like uh oh app builder configure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m28s)

[Swagger what does this do is this their](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m32s)

[own](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m34s)

[method it is it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m37s)

[is ah add M Points](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m41s)

[API oh look at that API](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m45s)

[key yeah so they've so we actually may](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m50s)

[want some of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m53s)

[this in the long run for sure yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m55s)

[kind of wondering if I just steal it now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h23m58s)

[and I'm kind of just looking to see if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m00s)

[one of these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m03s)

[guys registers](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m05s)

[up extra stuff this is pulling in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m08s)

[files path](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m12s)

[join that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m14s)

[interesting I'm trying to remember the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m17s)

[rules between path joint and path](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m19s)

[combined one of them is intelligent one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m20s)

[of them just like blindly puts slashes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m23s)

[in um add secret manager okay so let me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m26s)

[let me let me borrow this file real](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m31s)

[quick because you know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m33s)

[borrowing um seems reasonable and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m37s)

[let](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m41s)

[me I don't think that's going to fix](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m42s)

[my thingy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m45s)

[mobber](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m48s)

[yet but it does add that it adds Colonel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m50s)

[me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m54s)

[memory they do some core](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m56s)

[stuff just trying to look to see if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h24m59s)

[there's anything else that they do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m01s)

[that adds this because they add kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m03s)

[memory and do some extra stuff there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m08s)

[they add a health check end point though](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m12s)

[it's kind of a worthless one but that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m15s)

[no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m17s)

[different they've got a bunch of output](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m18s)

[and logger stuff at handle is hosted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m21s)

[service oh so they're doing a hosted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m25s)

[service for the processing okay okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m27s)

[okay got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m29s)

[it got got got got got got got it got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m31s)

[you name space clean that up biger](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m35s)

[Swagger we go here we go here we go here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m40s)

[we go here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m43s)

[go uh kernel memory config](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m49s)

[I don't know what do it use in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m54s)

[config for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m57s)

[exactly uh service authorization enabled](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h25m59s)

[run web service open open API](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m02s)

[enabled let's just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m08s)

[do oh batch sizing uh let's go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m14s)

[here and we're going to just do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m19s)

[this right because I think we can get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m22s)

[away with this now get away with this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m24s)

[now okay really co-pilot really I know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m27s)

[you're trying to show off but knock it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m31s)

[off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m33s)

[um I don't know if those are real I was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m35s)

[looking to see if they were it doesn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m38s)

[look like they are I don't think they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m40s)

[are um I mean nice try also Max kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m42s)

[memory yeah that's that might be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m47s)

[little well hold on kilobytes that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m50s)

[only a gig](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m51s)

[okay like it's not unreasonable no uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m54s)

[let's see if if not run web](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h26m57s)

[service this this this thing bothers me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m02s)

[don't know that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m07s)

[name how you can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m08s)

[invert](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m11s)

[right hold on I think I got that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m15s)

[backwards didn't I this is okay invert](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m18s)

[if thank you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m22s)

[uh so if run so it wants config](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m28s)

[service and then run web service so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m33s)

[inside of here it wants inside of you it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m36s)

[wants something called](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m39s)

[run web](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m44s)

[service and it wants it to be you're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m46s)

[very close co-pilot let me help you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m49s)

[there you go want to do the next one no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m51s)

[see you lose you lose edity privileges](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m53s)

[copilot right and then we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h27m58s)

[do um and then it does](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m01s)

[this service authorization](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m05s)

[enabled so I want to turn on service](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m09s)

[authorization at the root of my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m11s)

[config and I think is that I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m17s)

[that's what's handling the turning on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m21s)

[the key stuff service](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m23s)

[authorization and show off knock it off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m29s)

[a lot of this stuff when I could](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m42s)

[probably just go poach it right out of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m44s)

[their config](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m45s)

[probably uh let's see console kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m48s)

[memory service there's the one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h28m51s)

[wow they got a lot of stuff in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h29m02s)

[a couple of these endpoints are wanting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h31m35s)

[this configuration provider and I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h31m37s)

[parameter name is called context](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m13s)

[provider and that was the type when I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m16s)

[looks remarkably like what I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m27s)

[want that's in the main library though](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m31s)

[I want to go Builder Services](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m39s)

[add there I assume they probably have a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m46s)

[top level method that probably works its](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m49s)

[way down into this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m52s)

[huz yeah so I'm probably just missing a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m55s)

[top level invocation that gets me down](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m57s)

[to it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h32m59s)

[show I now have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m01s)

[this which is kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m04s)

[terrifying and kind of awesome all at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m07s)

[the same](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m09s)

[time but it gives me the fact gives me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m10s)

[yeah the fact that it just provides it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m13s)

[to you is kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m14s)

[slick](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m16s)

[um there's your file upload yeah except](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m19s)

[for they didn't file upload they didn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m23s)

[configure the Swagger for file uploads](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m25s)

[so I mean they're probably not presuming](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m29s)

[that you're going to be using the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m31s)

[Swagger but the hell am I supposed to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m32s)

[send it like right code that sounds like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m34s)

[work what make make a postman request](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m39s)

[what yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m44s)

[that's okay maybe I will contribute back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m47s)

[to Colonel memory and I will fix the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m49s)

[swag](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m51s)

[yeah there you go you should do that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m54s)

[that that seems like a thing we could do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m56s)

[okay so sorry we did all of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h33m58s)

[this which is great but now the question](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m01s)

[right is this thing here has the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m04s)

[upload but at the end of the day what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m07s)

[what I think we want to do a file name](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m11s)

[upload yeah but I so let me let me see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m14s)

[if I'm grocking this properly right so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m19s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m22s)

[uh well but this is abstraction right so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m26s)

[this guy here adds all our end points in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m29s)

[right and we can we can look at what the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m32s)

[the post upload does right so it Maps a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m35s)

[request does all of this stuff right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m38s)

[posts the the upload and gets us all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m42s)

[going which is great right like this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m45s)

[kind of what we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m47s)

[expect yes it Imports the document does](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m49s)

[the work](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m52s)

[does everything we want gives us back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m54s)

[and accepted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m56s)

[great](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h34m59s)

[um but what I am missing then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m02s)

[is like this thing here has to add in so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m06s)

[on the service that they have here right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m11s)

[they have to add in a hosted service for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m14s)

[doing the processing because I realize](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m15s)

[in their in their read me right they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m18s)

[show](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m21s)

[where did it go they show this picture](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m24s)

[right kernel memory web service kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m26s)

[memory async handlers but the thing is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m29s)

[is if I were to draw this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m32s)

[box like well you know excluding](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m36s)

[excluding this and this right all the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m39s)

[rest of this is all running inside of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m43s)

[single ASP net core app because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m45s)

[think I think what I understand like the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m49s)

[default fig that I think I saw is these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m53s)

[handlers are a hosted service inside the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m55s)

[same instance at least on the sample](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h35m58s)

[right they don't have to be in there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m00s)

[yeah they like they they clearly don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m02s)

[have to go in there yes I think you're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m05s)

[correct though in the in the example](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m07s)

[that is I believe how they set it up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m09s)

[yeah because they do the add Cel memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m12s)

[end points and then where did I see it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m14s)

[there was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m18s)

[a add handlers as hosted service right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m19s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m23s)

[if your orchestration type is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m24s)

[distributed that's my handlers are going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m25s)

[to be outside of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m27s)

[this but if we go with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m29s)

[the um the default handlers this guy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m32s)

[here the way he wants to configure this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m36s)

[is ADD handlers as hosted service now I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m38s)

[don't think we want to do this but I am](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m41s)

[wondering if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m44s)

[should register up a hosted service to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m47s)

[Pro like this is where this is where I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m50s)

[missing something](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m52s)

[of where where does this go at handlers'](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m56s)

[hosted service right because somewhere](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h36m59s)

[in here at hosted service Handler as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m02s)

[hosted service T Handler right so this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m05s)

[guy here is a thing that they have MH](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m08s)

[this guy implements IH hosted service is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m12s)

[a pipeline step](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m16s)

[Handler and so then this guy just shells](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m20s)

[into the orchestrator so so I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m22s)

[wondering](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m24s)

[if this is kind of what we are looking](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m26s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m28s)

[do I think well I think that that's it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m30s)

[an option I think you're right though we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m34s)

[end up with this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m37s)

[running as one service with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m40s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m45s)

[Services right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m47s)

[um is if we write this as a hosted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m49s)

[service we could extract it into a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m51s)

[separate running container later but it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m53s)

[at least as far as what I can tell it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m57s)

[doesn't look](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h37m59s)

[like I don't know how much their stuff](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m02s)

[is I'm torn between what their thing is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m06s)

[getting me and what I want to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m08s)

[right so that that's where I'm a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m12s)

[torn on do I leverage their stuff or do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m15s)

[I just spin](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m18s)

[it because if I spin it myself and throw](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m20s)

[it in into the que and I write just a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m23s)

[simple little console app to pull from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m27s)

[que I don't need a lot of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m29s)

[stuff do I want that is the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m32s)

[question that is a good question then I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m37s)

[could net Aspire](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m39s)

[there's one you do have the question I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m41s)

[think of what would we be losing by](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m45s)

[doing that yeah like they've got this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m48s)

[orchestrator and similar things in here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m51s)

[that look to be doing quite a bit of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m53s)

[work for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m55s)

[you yeah and I mean even if you go into](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m56s)

[those](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m58s)

[handlers](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h38m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m03s)

[yep we've got so we've got yeah the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m05s)

[regular generate embeddings Handler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m09s)

[we've got generate embeddings Handler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m11s)

[batch I believe is the B1 there and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m13s)

[we've got parallel or no that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m16s)

[base but parallel is going to be the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m19s)

[probably the more ay one I would imagine](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m22s)

[yeah I would suspect the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m25s)

[same](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m32s)

[yeah yeah so there's definitely there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m33s)

[definitely something here that is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m36s)

[probably worth](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m39s)

[leveraging I would suspect this this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m42s)

[getting into that that piece I was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m44s)

[talking about where you're sending up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m46s)

[multiple embeddings to process at once](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m48s)

[and you're you're reducing that uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m50s)

[that request response time because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m53s)

[you're getting it all together yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m55s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h39m59s)

[is yeah and they've kind of solved a lot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m02s)

[of these problems I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m05s)

[wondering if I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m09s)

[should look at bringing this guy in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m13s)

[because there's not that much](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m17s)

[here right km configuration service](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m20s)

[like to some degree I want some of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m24s)

[because this looks to be the thing that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m27s)

[they published as a Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m29s)

[image and I mean functionally we want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m31s)

[all of it the pieces that we want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m33s)

[change are those those handlers and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m37s)

[which handlers we're using and from the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m41s)

[looks of it we can actually do that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m42s)

[through configuration which I was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m45s)

[actually completely unaware of that that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m47s)

[ability I we still we still have to roll](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m51s)

[our own I see you're saying so that we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m54s)

[can bring in our our own uh dll but from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h40m56s)

[there we could probably just replace](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m00s)

[them through configuration as opposed to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m04s)

[making changes in code ah again](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m07s)

[completely I was completely unaware of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m10s)

[that that component of this yeah you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m12s)

[make a good point so if we go that route](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m16s)

[hang on then hang on because that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m21s)

[That Could That Could seriously lower](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m23s)

[this all right so if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m26s)

[go Kel memory is a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m30s)

[service](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m34s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m36s)

[uh and I think we just have to dash e](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m38s)

[those in right no we need the we need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m42s)

[the assembly inside of oh yeah inside of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m46s)

[the doer image so it needs to go in as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m50s)

[part of the the image that we build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m52s)

[mhm that is true I'm just trying to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h41m56s)

[decide so functionally I build a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m01s)

[separate](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m04s)

[dll with the Handler that we've already](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m06s)

[got right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m08s)

[yep I am wondering then what is the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m10s)

[easiest](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m13s)

[way to leverage this because on one hand](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m15s)

[at that point I kind of want to just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m18s)

[like because here's the thing you can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m24s)

[volume the assembly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m26s)

[in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m28s)

[right yeah the the only thing the only](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m31s)

[thing that's giving me the thing that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m34s)

[giving me pause with doing that right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m37s)

[like this is perfectly fine for bringing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m38s)

[in files when you're running locally I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m41s)

[just trying to think about how I do that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m44s)

[inside of an Azure container app because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m46s)

[how do I get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m50s)

[like that and that's where I'm that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m54s)

[where I'm like man](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m55s)

[something it's it feels very](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h42m58s)

[close](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m02s)

[MH because I think you can mount like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m06s)

[like blobs and that kind of thing which](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m10s)

[is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m12s)

[fine scope as your files volume like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m15s)

[this is all fine but the thing that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m19s)

[bothers me a little bit is that means I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m20s)

[now have an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m22s)

[image I guess it means I don't need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m26s)

[multi-stage darker file then doab build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m29s)

[and do a second stage based on this one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m31s)

[with your dll pulled](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m33s)

[in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m34s)

[oh I like Izzy's idea better that yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m37s)

[that's pretty clean okay okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m42s)

[so okay so I okay I've only done this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m48s)

[like once so but let's okay I am going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m52s)

[to do something](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m55s)

[crazy I am going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h43m57s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m00s)

[stash right throw that away for a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m02s)

[moment Let's do let's do this let's go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m05s)

[add stop debugging right let's add us](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m09s)

[let's add us a new](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m13s)

[project um if they are going to be I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m15s)

[guess we're all net 8 right like they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m19s)

[don't yep is their assembly load stuff](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m21s)

[so that like framework's going to matter](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m23s)

[here but I can do class library](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m25s)

[now right and then we go here and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m28s)

[go here and I go Ai and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m32s)

[go select folder and we're going to call](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m36s)

[this kaboo](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m39s)

[bot lib for lack of better words right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m41s)

[go here go here now I need to pull in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m46s)

[the kernel memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m49s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m53s)

[uh you need at least the service ASP net](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m56s)

[core post](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h44m59s)

[grass well no I don't think I need those](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m01s)

[to copy this guy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m16s)

[down](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m18s)

[paste you need to add Secrets then a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m20s)

[third stage which just copies everything](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m22s)

[into a scratch image then no one can see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m24s)

[the layers with the sensitive info Izzy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m25s)

[you're about to become my best](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m28s)

[need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m39s)

[um Microsoft Cel memory AI open AI which](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m41s)

[I think is the top level](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m45s)

[package I think this is the the key one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m47s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m50s)

[needed I go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h45m51s)

[um okay so that should clean up some of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m04s)

[them okay data formats text kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m11s)

[memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m14s)

[handlers oh and this doesn't have our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m15s)

[fixes from the other one oops maybe I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m18s)

[maybe I want some of that but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m23s)

[we'll we'll fix up we'll fix up what you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m26s)

[were asking for um and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m28s)

[that gets me through there and then the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m40s)

[question is do I need any of that no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m41s)

[what's the last Red squiggle calculate](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m45s)

[sha 256 that's right this one we had to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m48s)

[write our own](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m51s)

[little because they they made it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m53s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m55s)

[so yeah we were jerks and made it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h46m57s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m00s)

[too okay change name space to match okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m03s)

[so now we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m06s)

[have this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m08s)

[guy and he should](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m10s)

[compile right so I've got this built](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m13s)

[we've got our](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m16s)

[partitioner in its own Library yep yep](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m17s)

[okay we got that we got that that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m22s)

[rocking rolling now we need a Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m25s)

[file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m30s)

[and this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m32s)

[where this is where Izzy is probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m35s)

[going to make fun of me but that's okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m37s)

[that is okay don't worry don't worry I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m41s)

[he can make fun of me too because I have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m43s)

[no clue to do this uh is there a Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m44s)

[B](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m47s)

[oh okay just give me a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m55s)

[blank thing I don't care just blank of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h47m58s)

[course you added the Cs on the end stop](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m02s)

[it stop I I understand file extensions](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m05s)

[knock it off okay so this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m09s)

[where uh let's see uh JC quick aside do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m13s)

[either of you know a way to recolor an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m18s)

[Ico quickly change all Blues to a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m20s)

[similar Shad in Orange ooh not quickly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m22s)

[JC but you'll find various um libraries](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m25s)

[and tools cuz an Ico actually is a bunch](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m29s)

[of bit maps at different resolutions so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m32s)

[it's not just one that you need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m35s)

[change you actually need to crack the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m37s)

[Ico open and fix all the pixels in all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m38s)

[the bit Maps which is kind of obnoxious](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m44s)

[um paint.net has an extension for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m47s)

[cracking open Ico files that I've used](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m50s)

[quite a bit um and the material designed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m53s)

[in zaml library if you look at the demo](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m55s)

[um has uh a library that's blue wolf I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h48m58s)

[think is the name of the nougat package](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m02s)

[that's a carpie way uh to do it yeah do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m04s)

[it the long way in vs yeah there is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m07s)

[almost assuredly a way if you look at if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m11s)

[you want to do it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m13s)

[programmatically you might look at the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m14s)

[nougat package used by the material](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m16s)

[design demo app because I believe it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m17s)

[gives you access to the bit maps and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m20s)

[then you could just you know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m21s)

[find replace but yeah long way and vs](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m23s)

[may be the either](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m27s)

[one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m29s)

[uh I think vs only likes Docker at the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m31s)

[container level by adding container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m34s)

[support oh I I think you're absolutely](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m36s)

[correct I he](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m38s)

[um I I think for the built-in one I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m40s)

[really don't like the way the the doer](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m43s)

[file gets jened for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m45s)

[the the other one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m47s)

[but yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m50s)

[um oh I guess you make a good point if I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m56s)

[move it up to the solution level I don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h49m58s)

[know where I want it I'm gonna leave it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m01s)

[here for the moment okay so this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m03s)

[where I'm going](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m06s)

[to S gears a little](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m08s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m12s)

[uh because I want to I want because this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m14s)

[is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m17s)

[where this thing here right because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m18s)

[like I've done this like once](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m21s)

[and this is where things get very](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m24s)

[interesting of being able to to do this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m30s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m32s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m35s)

[uh that icon find one that definitely](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m39s)

[looks looks possible um okay so I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m42s)

[what we want to do here is we want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m46s)

[start like this but then we want to go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m47s)

[and grab the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m50s)

[where is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m53s)

[there I already I already lost the file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m55s)

[that has published here right so I want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h50m58s)

[then let's see so at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m16s)

[then we want to copy in our assembly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m19s)

[I guess we don't actually care about](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m23s)

[this through I want to actually do my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m33s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m36s)

[first then have a layer based on the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m37s)

[Kernel memory latest maybe I shouldn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m41s)

[have maybe I shouldn't have done that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m44s)

[down this situation here right because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h51m59s)

[kind of want to do a little bit of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m02s)

[this um because this is where they get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m06s)

[into their fancy garbage stuff so let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m08s)

[we're going to just steal some bits and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m12s)

[pieces of this right so we want to come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m13s)

[in here we want to do this and we don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m15s)

[want this to be here this is going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m18s)

[end up being lib this is going to end up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m20s)

[being lib this is going to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m23s)

[lib right uh use apphost is it going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m28s)

[make a lick a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m32s)

[difference](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m34s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m35s)

[um I am I actually don't know what this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m37s)

[parameter does for for repo](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m40s)

[route I I might want to go look up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m44s)

[because I'm not familiar with that one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m46s)

[um but this is going to get it built](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m51s)

[this is going to publish into an app.](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m55s)

[publish then we drop](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h52m57s)

[into here now this is this from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m00s)

[here is what we don't care about right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m05s)

[so this is going to end up looking more](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m08s)

[like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m11s)

[this uh let's see platform comes from](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m14s)

[build](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m18s)

[platform okay so that comes through here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m19s)

[run image](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m22s)

[tag so I think we go here right and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m26s)

[what we end up wanting to do is we want](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m31s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m33s)

[copy like that thank you co-pilot you've](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m34s)

[been a wonderful audience to bring in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m38s)

[our dll as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m40s)

[needed right and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m43s)

[we this is where I'm a little confused](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m48s)

[do I still end up having to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m50s)

[do the entry point I think I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m54s)

[do right because I don't think and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h53m57s)

[don't think I want this entry point](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m02s)

[obviously I think I want to come back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m04s)

[here here here close close right because](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m15s)

[at the end of the day this is going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m20s)

[to be actually what I want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m22s)

[execute yeah because we're layering on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m24s)

[top of that I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m27s)

[I hang on wrong](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m30s)

[yes wait which which one are you trying](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m52s)

[to add it to the API or the lib lib API](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m54s)

[is functionally dead just pretend it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m57s)

[doesn't exist it's there for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h54m58s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m00s)

[um right and then we do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m04s)

[this I think I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m13s)

[and then where my do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m24s)

[Des](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m28s)

[wow no vulnerabilities that's actually](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m52s)

[somewhat shocking to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m54s)

[me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m56s)

[um I think I end up having to look](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h55m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h56m01s)

[give oh yeah read write EX a there's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m18s)

[potentially a permissions problem here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m22s)

[of yeah these guys needing that um where](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m24s)

[prior to the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m45s)

[copy uh is he got a session I'm putting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m49s)

[together at the moment might see if I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m53s)

[allowed to record it and upload it to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m55s)

[YouTube oh please do please do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=01h59m56s)

[stream say is he if you want to come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m09s)

[educate me that is that is definitely an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m12s)

[option um because there's the own and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m14s)

[then this is I think this is also what](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m18s)

[we're la here right because this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m21s)

[copying](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m23s)

[in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m24s)

[and screw it let's just grab the whole](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m27s)

[line real quick this is kind of what we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m29s)

[want see um except for I want to when I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m34s)

[replaces the one above well actually so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m37s)

[here we can make this line work](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m40s)

[perfectly if I just do this right boom](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m42s)

[there I set the working directory above](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m44s)

[then period is actually the right target](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m46s)

[directory and then bippy boy booya okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m48s)

[so col service assembly dll is what you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m50s)

[were saying was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m53s)

[missing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m55s)

[Microsoft already blank interal memory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h00m59s)

[service assembly](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m01s)

[dll why you've only got the AI and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m03s)

[abstractions I would suspect it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m08s)

[because you're not pulling the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m11s)

[image oh yeah yeah you think that think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m15s)

[you think that's the problem like right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m19s)

[here where pull the wrong bloody image](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m21s)

[yeah that might be that might be part of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m23s)

[it might be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m25s)

[um so I is possible yeah so we want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m28s)

[actually do this guy](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m33s)

[right and we will](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m35s)

[do they posted straight to dockerhub](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m38s)

[there's not one on Microsoft's container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m41s)

[registry right let's just double check](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m44s)

[yeah I would say let's go let's go check](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m47s)

[if I can pull from I would almost I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m49s)

[would be almost surprised if they didn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m52s)

[post it to both but um I mean it depends](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m54s)

[the Microsoft one is basically like only](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h01m58s)

[Microsoft all the time and so the does](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m01s)

[it not include like their open source](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m05s)

[stuff not it is very common for them not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m07s)

[to include their open like if it's not a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m10s)

[microsoft. prefix it is not uncommon for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m12s)

[it not to be here so that's that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m15s)

[that's fine that's fine we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m17s)

[can we can we can not do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m20s)

[that um and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m23s)

[then yeah we'll just let that it as is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m29s)

[okay so that might that might make a big](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m33s)

[difference uh let me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m36s)

[out um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m48s)

[oh uh that is well I can't this is not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h02m52s)

[interesting how do I do managed identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m10s)

[across um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m17s)

[how do I I think I have to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m23s)

[do and pull the Azure CLI or](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m29s)

[similar inside the container then log in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m33s)

[internally the libraries are probably](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m53s)

[just using the Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m55s)

[identity um Nate package to do all of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h21m57s)

[their work should make sense it it can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m01s)

[read from a number of sources one of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m04s)

[which is environment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m06s)

[authenticated](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m27s)

[with uh see I yeah I can do it inside a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m29s)

[container group and in Azure easy enough](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m33s)

[that's I don't know how to do it inside](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m35s)

[of my local Docker](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m38s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m39s)

[oh okay so they gen an access token](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m46s)

[strip it out and then pass that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m52s)

[ah that might be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h22m58s)

[workaround that might be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m01s)

[I uh let's see blog documentation let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m19s)

[let's because the ones they were setting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m25s)

[up the thing that bothers me with this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m31s)

[is this is pulling a client um client ID](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m33s)

[in secret out of in this case](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m37s)

[environment variables to be able to read](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m39s)

[it which is fine when you control it but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m41s)

[I want to ultimately set the entra](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m43s)

[IDS um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m48s)

[which means not doing it that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m51s)

[way](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m55s)

[uh this might end up being a bigger pain](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h23m57s)

[than I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m00s)

[thought because I can assign an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m05s)

[identity I can pull the identity but all](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m08s)

[of this is inside of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m11s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m22s)

[um identity access yeah see this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m25s)

[is authenticate with token I think this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m30s)

[is the way you generally work around](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m33s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h24m38s)

[authentication token](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h25m03s)

[for it's just going to need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h25m05s)

[config is set up over](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h25m11s)

[here you know what let me do this let me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h25m17s)

[strip my secrets out](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h25m35s)

[that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m16s)

[okay so that should give me an Ingress](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m21s)

[that I can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m23s)

[hit and let me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m25s)

[in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m30s)

[idiot um I doubt that but okay so small](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m48s)

[hangup](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m52s)

[is I don't know how to run this locally](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m55s)

[and authenticate inside of a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h30m58s)

[container because I was I we selected](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m01s)

[Microsoft entry ID right Azure ad right](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m04s)

[and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m10s)

[so the problem I have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m11s)

[now is I don't know how to get my Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m15s)

[identity inside of my container without](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m18s)

[jumping through some](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m21s)

[hoops a much simp a much simpler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m23s)

[solution is I just configure my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m26s)

[container W environment and I send](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m28s)

[it I think I think that's the path of of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m32s)

[least resistance it's a it's annoying](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m35s)

[and forces me to push and all of that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m38s)

[garbage but at least I can do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m40s)

[that because all right fair enough or I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m44s)

[have to jump through some hoops for like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m46s)

[taking my a login Jenning a token](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m49s)

[slapping that in as an environment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m53s)

[variable or similar on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m54s)

[mine setting up the tenant ID and all of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m56s)

[that stuff um oh set the network of the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h31m59s)

[container I don't think that works is he](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m02s)

[for Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m05s)

[identity because the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m10s)

[um the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m14s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m17s)

[uh because that'll route the the traffic](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m18s)

[through my local machine but it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m21s)

[won't yeah feature request this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m24s)

[thing um yeah if they're using default](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m27s)

[Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m30s)

[credential um that like there's not an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m34s)

[easy way of doing it because the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m37s)

[identity thing search through like half](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m40s)

[a dozen different items and I think the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m41s)

[easiest thing is to have like that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m44s)

[shared cash or similar](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m47s)

[um O Let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m51s)

[see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m54s)

[uh okay yuck so this guy's just bringing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h32m57s)

[in the Microsoft Azure CLI and in his](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m01s)

[darker composed he mounts his local.](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m04s)

[aure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m06s)

[directory and the code sets up off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m08s)

[with yeah and so he's he's cheating the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m15s)

[system by making sure that as your CLI](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m17s)

[credential is a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m20s)

[enabled](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m28s)

[yeah uh which is the same as you but I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m30s)

[check out the CLI install script into my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m32s)

[Dev container it's a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m35s)

[oneliner](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m38s)

[um yuck I'm going to just pin this on my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m43s)

[read read thing maybe maybe this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m47s)

[isn't as bad as I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m49s)

[thought cuz if it really is just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m52s)

[this let's let's look at his Dev](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m57s)

[container real quick let's look at his](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h33m59s)

[Dev](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m00s)

[container uh in a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m01s)

[container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m05s)

[yep and again I'm making an assumption](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m07s)

[of how they're using it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m10s)

[internally but most things that say](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m13s)

[Azure identity they're going to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m15s)

[referencing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m17s)

[as your identity internally and then](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m19s)

[referencing it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m22s)

[across uh if you will install you'll be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m25s)

[required to a login in the container to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m27s)

[have the container onor your host](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m30s)

[machines AZ login then you need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m32s)

[expose this all the way through here so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m33s)

[this is actually a fun experiment um if](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m37s)

[anybody wants to see a sample of this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m39s)

[there's an open source here spiler I can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m41s)

[show this off I can show this off](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m45s)

[too so if anybody wonders how velop pack](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m47s)

[stores your creds when you log in we're](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m50s)

[using the same thing that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h34m59s)

[uh where is it it's inside a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m02s)

[flow off configuration we're using the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m05s)

[same stuff that the Azure CLI does for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m08s)

[storing your authentication](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m13s)

[tokens uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m15s)

[build public app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m21s)

[async where is it it's in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m23s)

[I only wrote the code that doesn't mean](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m26s)

[I actually remember where I wrote](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m28s)

[it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m30s)

[um this guy here so when you build the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m31s)

[public client](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m34s)

[application and you acquire tokens you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m36s)

[can actually store it uh in there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m39s)

[locally so if anybody's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m42s)

[interested hey survival uh so right now](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m45s)

[we are are using uh kernel](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m49s)

[memory basically to make uh a we'll call](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m54s)

[it a GPT clone of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h35m58s)

[myself and trying to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m01s)

[properly Host this in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m04s)

[Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m06s)

[um that's the that's the the the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m08s)

[two-liner version as soon as I go back](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m10s)

[to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m13s)

[here uh you're interested this basically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m14s)

[this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m19s)

[yeah basically this with a with a small](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m20s)

[tweak where we just throw away one bit](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m22s)

[of it and put in our own little Handler](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m24s)

[in the middle um and it proves that it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m26s)

[is slightly more complicated than one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m29s)

[would H](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m32s)

[for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m33s)

[um but also quite a bit more powerful](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m35s)

[than uh one would expect yeah that is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m38s)

[true so this is all the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m41s)

[kubernetes here's how you run it with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m44s)

[one line and darker file so this is just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m46s)

[going to pull down](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m48s)

[this and then if we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m50s)

[Mount the volume as part of this we can](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m53s)

[then bring it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h36m56s)

[in okay well why not let's give it a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h37m00s)

[shot it can't hurt anything right and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h37m04s)

[this is all because you want to be able](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h37m08s)

[to test locally yeah correct because I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h37m10s)

[heck let's just okay okay so a pro tip](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m43s)

[if you try to compile a Docker file as a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m48s)

[C file it don't work don't do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m49s)

[that I like how it removed it first and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m55s)

[then added it back well it removed it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m57s)

[from the nun set which is the one that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h53m59s)

[says Don't compile it and then added it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m01s)

[to the compile set which is the please](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m03s)

[compile this for me it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m05s)

[like and in what world did we want that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m08s)

[that's probably showed up at one point](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m10s)

[when I when I added it because I added](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m13s)

[it as a C file so it probably got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m16s)

[brought in there okay yeah I'm willing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m18s)

[to bet that was probably the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m20s)

[Catalyst but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=02h54m24s)

[um when you tag this needing to give it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m27s)

[oh okay um so I was wondering if it was](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m30s)

[lacking the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m34s)

[repository yeah name to go along with it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m36s)

[was Theory](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m38s)

[one um I guess this one claims](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m48s)

[uh what let's try](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m54s)

[this I'm honestly not remembering the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h04m56s)

[difference so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m00s)

[I wonder is it because I've double](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m18s)

[tagged](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m20s)

[this the tag needs to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m21s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m24s)

[be got](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m26s)

[it solution don't apply both tags with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m32s)

[the D- push option because then it tries](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m36s)

[to send both of them rather than just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m39s)

[the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m40s)

[one so I need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m43s)

[to separate up the the building and the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m46s)

[pushing if I wanted to do it that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m49s)

[way yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m53s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m55s)

[works though I suspect I still needed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m57s)

[the permissions change to give me push X](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h05m59s)

[yeah you definitely need the permission](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m03s)

[yeah you needed the permissions changed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m05s)

[regardless but so then once this comes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m07s)

[up over here we should be able to come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m10s)

[over and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m13s)

[do as I find the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m15s)

[go back here because there's my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m27s)

[container registry oof that guy exists](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m28s)

[that guy exists great I'm over](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h06m31s)

[was oh because this is a particular](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m16s)

[container app hang on I want to back up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m19s)

[I want to go to The Container app](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m22s)

[environment and I would like to spin a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m24s)

[new](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m26s)

[app uh because I kind of want to just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m28s)

[you oh this will I don't want to delete](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m37s)

[the environment fine fine you are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m40s)

[annoying and I reject your premise I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m45s)

[will just spin a new app from the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m48s)

[environment uh let's see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m53s)

[here yeah apps create create container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h07m56s)

[app you will now be called my bot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m01s)

[because I am too lazy to think of it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m03s)

[bring your own container registry blah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m05s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m07s)

[blah uh that is our environment we are](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m08s)

[going here our registry will be that one](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m12s)

[our image will be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m16s)

[uh because admin credentials oh that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m19s)

[right be you so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m24s)

[much um this is an annoying thing that I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m26s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m31s)

[upour](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m43s)

[back next](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m45s)

[yeah at least it doesn't make you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m53s)

[refresh the page yeah so we go there we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m54s)

[go there we go there we do this we do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m57s)

[this we do this we go next bindings we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h08m59s)

[don't need any](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m01s)

[bindings do I turn on the Ingress sure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m03s)

[why not send it if we're going to do it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m06s)

[we're going to do it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m08s)

[all um Target Port](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m09s)

[901 uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m15s)

[uh you and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m18s)

[create send](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m20s)

[it and now I'm getting excited don't get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m24s)

[excited I predict it fails immediately](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m27s)

[and I predict that based on the fact](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m31s)

[that even though I created an identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m33s)

[for my Azure container app environment I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m35s)

[have not granted it permission to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m37s)

[darn](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m39s)

[anything so I'm probably going to need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m40s)

[to granted permission to like Azure open](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m43s)

[AI at a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m46s)

[minimum kind of I'm kind of suspecting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m48s)

[that that's going to be a](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m50s)

[thing right see and and while I agree](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m53s)

[with you I think that's only once we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m56s)

[send in a file oh you think it'll think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h09m58s)

[it'll start on its own I don't think it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m01s)

[yeah it doesn't confirm access until you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m04s)

[actually try to request fair I suspect](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m06s)

[or it could die on](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m11s)

[site but is it for the reason you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m13s)

[suspect that's that that's that's my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m15s)

[question question now uh let's see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m17s)

[successfully connected blah blah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m19s)

[blah Azure open a can validated endpoint](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m21s)

[must start with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m26s)

[https that's the config wasn't in there](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m29s)

[that's not that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m31s)

[the I think the config it just needs to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m34s)

[be adjusted so we're going to look here](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m37s)

[on the development](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m40s)

[one right so it's complaining](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m42s)

[about which one is is it unhappy Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m45s)

[open AI endpoint must start with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m48s)

[https](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m52s)

[um okay so Azure open](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m55s)

[AI endpoint](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h10m59s)

[oh I think it actually wants these](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m03s)

[things to not just be the name but to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m07s)

[the fully qualified oh so when it it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m09s)

[asked probably oh so on that wizard when](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m11s)

[it was saying the things that it wanted](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m14s)

[it wanted me to type the whole bloody](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m16s)

[URL out oh yuck well I'm I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m17s)

[though because I remember specifically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m21s)

[on at least one of them I was looking at](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m23s)

[that and thinking oh nice it's just the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m25s)

[name because they put the the URL around](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m27s)

[you know htps insert this correct dot](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m30s)

[blah blah blah correct yes and maybe it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m33s)

[wasn't the open AI ones but I thought it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m35s)

[I know at least one of them was like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m37s)

[that or at least it said it was like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m38s)

[that whether it actually executed that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m40s)

[way make no guant points behind a clicky](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m43s)

[thing so I just want to check them](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m45s)

[yep I'm always wise to do that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m47s)

[okay it is safe to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m52s)

[show so I think we need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m54s)

[this yeah and I think we need tend to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h11m57s)

[agree I think we need](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m00s)

[this here and here yep right I would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m02s)

[suspect so and I'd also just scroll](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m07s)

[let's see if we can find one that has](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m10s)

[the full URL not well the problem is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m13s)

[most of these looked like they weren't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m17s)

[fully filled out because we didn't elect](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m19s)

[to use those but we' at least have the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m21s)

[storage container and we'd have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m23s)

[um uh SQL](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m27s)

[server or not no and well the post this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m29s)

[is this is the development one I so I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m34s)

[have intentionally stripped out my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m37s)

[postgress connection string because yes](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m39s)

[it is the fully qualified and yes it has](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m41s)

[the username and password in it so not](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m42s)

[sharing that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m45s)

[but you did replace that in the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m47s)

[production one already Yes because we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m48s)

[did the whatever the default they gave](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m51s)

[us was um where's storage account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m53s)

[then Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m56s)

[blobs so this just asked for the account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h12m58s)

[and the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m01s)

[container so I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m02s)

[think it must be going through the SDK](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m06s)

[for it rather than fully qualified so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m08s)

[then that so then that would make me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m10s)

[suspect that this end point for Azure](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m12s)

[open AI embeddings or any of them](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m14s)

[doesn't have to beop a. azure.com well](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m18s)

[but can you host it under a different no](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m21s)

[I think I think it's just specifically](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m24s)

[saying it wants https the other](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m26s)

[alternative is it could be empty string](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m28s)

[right maybe it failed to read the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m30s)

[config yeah that's possibility](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m33s)

[B right so I'm GNA go here I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m36s)

[here and I'm just going to whoop drag](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m41s)

[that sucker off screen real](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m43s)

[quick well I open up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m45s)

[the relevant files and just do a quick](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m50s)

[replacement because I just don't want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m55s)

[accidentally uh scroll too far and show](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m57s)

[the wrong file and you know then I have](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h13m59s)

[to go cycle Keys again yeah that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m03s)

[really exciting](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m09s)

[oh interesting so I'm GNA drag this in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m12s)

[just to show you I real quick scan my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m17s)

[screen to make sure I don't accidentally](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m20s)

[expose anything](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m21s)

[okay so I noticed this and I fixed this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m23s)

[on the development one I think when I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m27s)

[tried to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m30s)

[paste that's the problem with those](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m31s)

[console libraries they don't play nice](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m33s)

[with stuff like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m36s)

[this and it bothers](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m38s)

[me I fixed it on the development side](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m41s)

[what was that character uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m44s)

[lowlevel ask I have to go pull it up but](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m48s)

[X weird](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m52s)

[16 so yeah so that that no boy no okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m54s)

[so now we go back over here we do this](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h14m58s)

[whole thing again I don't think this is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m02s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m04s)

[relevant we reild we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m12s)

[relaunch and then I think I can just um](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m14s)

[do the equivalent of kill](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m18s)

[on this thing to get it to relaunch the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h15m22s)

[okay yeah I I would I would be willing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m21s)

[to bet when you built the project they](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m23s)

[were in there because you never want to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m25s)

[put in app setting. jsons no you do you](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m28s)

[generally do check them](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m31s)

[in not the production one not any of](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m33s)

[like the extra ones you always check](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m36s)

[them in because they shouldn't contain](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m38s)

[Secrets like in general you should put](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h28m43s)

[past Kevin was brilliant knew that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m07s)

[future Kevin was going to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m09s)

[dumb so that's that's convenient](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m12s)

[ask Kevin's a really nice guy yeah okay](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m17s)

[so so what do we want to build then just](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m18s)

[a little CLI app that hits](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m21s)

[this I mean shoot we could just hit it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m24s)

[with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m28s)

[Postman I mean as long as our as long as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m32s)

[our endpoint that doesn't require file](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m35s)

[upload even if it does you can do that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m37s)

[with post what are we going to hit it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m39s)

[with like I guess I can send my file up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m41s)

[right yeah uh one second I might need to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m44s)

[change my authentication account](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m47s)

[here I don't know what account I'm](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h29m50s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m05s)

[um also you should probably drag that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m08s)

[off screen and then make an environment](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m11s)

[variable for your API key so you don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m13s)

[have to do](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m15s)

[later uh I think I spin my collection](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m17s)

[first don't that don't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m20s)

[you can do it either way yeah I was like](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m26s)

[an environment or as a collection and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m28s)

[was going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m31s)

[uh yeah let's go here create](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m38s)

[environment uh bot cra](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m42s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m46s)

[Au](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h30m49s)

[easiest way to get my](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h31m49s)

[API signatures](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h31m51s)

[I not a clean way to send that header in](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h31m57s)

[a browser to hit Swagger the only weird](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h31m59s)

[thing yeah isn't there a way to generate](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m05s)

[these from a API open API spec](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m09s)

[yeah I believe so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m16s)

[um generate tests](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m21s)

[Postman generate from open](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m23s)

[API uh let's see Postman Learning Center](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m28s)

[that sounds](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m32s)

[like integrate Postman with a blah blah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h32m34s)

[here uh oh you should save your value](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m05s)

[otherwise it probably doesn't work](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m09s)

[it's still unhappy make sure the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m19s)

[VAR is the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m22s)

[active select an environment as](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m24s)

[active there we go okay so we got an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m27s)

[environment beautiful that in theory is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m30s)

[going to get populated we think that's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m33s)

[the right place um can we just do a get](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m34s)

[to make](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m40s)

[sure there an easy way to do this let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m41s)

[just send this I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m44s)

[don't maybe a invalid URL so base URL is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m47s)

[incorrect that is not shocking yeah so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m53s)

[if we go here and I do this and I](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h35m56s)

[do base URL right and then we can come](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h36m00s)

[back over here and I can grab](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h36m06s)

[should](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m18s)

[index but do I need to were we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m20s)

[specifying that](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m22s)

[previously the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m24s)

[index when we did this before yeah we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m26s)

[were we were identifying we were](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m29s)

[identifying at least document ID and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m30s)

[index or we're there's a default index](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m32s)

[and it's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m35s)

[ours let's see because you're right ID](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m37s)

[was GID new GID so tools](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m41s)

[uh create guid what I heard](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m45s)

[was uh](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m48s)

[copy and so we need ID paste right so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m52s)

[there's oh I guess that needs to be](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h42m58s)

[document](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m00s)

[ID document ID](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m01s)

[great that gets me that gets me](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m04s)

[there and then index index where to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m08s)

[store the data uploaded what do I send](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m11s)

[for an index](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m14s)

[so I believe that the default is](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m17s)

[default uh oh I guess we actually know](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m20s)

[that because we we can we queried it and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m23s)

[we pulled it we pulled it back so the](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m26s)

[default is in fact](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m28s)

[default](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m30s)

[so](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h43m33s)

[I'm doing is a container app identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m04s)

[assign and make sure that it actually](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m07s)

[brings it in from a user assigned but we](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m10s)

[should have a system assigned](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m13s)

[identity for our container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m16s)

[app go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m19s)

[look oh I didn't turn on the identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m30s)

[for the container app I turned it on for](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m34s)

[the other](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m38s)

[app it was nobody so it really doesn't](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m40s)

[have an identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m43s)

[okay so there there is that we are also](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m45s)

[then going to you still we are going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m47s)

[then probably need to Grant it](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m50s)

[permission](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m51s)

[somewhere yes I would assume um yeah](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m54s)

[there's so now we have an](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h46m59s)

[identity but that means the next thing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m01s)

[that we do I don't know is it going to](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m04s)

[pick that up](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m06s)

[automatically send it I would I would](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m09s)

[thinking thinking it is thinking and](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m15s)

[thinking okay not authorized to perform](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m18s)

[request yes it has gotten its identity](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m21s)

[huzzah finally things are making sense](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m23s)

[huzzah uh Azure blob so we need to give](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m25s)

[storage](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m31s)

[to our thingy we go here we go Access](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m38s)

[Control we go add roll](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m43s)

[assignment and let's](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m47s)

[go blob contributor](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m50s)

[maybe storage BL data yeah I think](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m53s)

[that's probably good enough managed](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m57s)

[identity select](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h47m58s)

[members manage identity let's see](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m00s)

[container apps and we're going to do go](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m03s)

[with](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m06s)

[mybot and then review and assign review](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m08s)

[the the password in it we're not doing](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m36s)

[then yeah you're right storage container](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m39s)

[would be the only thing yeah G to delete](https://youtu.be/RKqwfwGb_Gk?t=03h48m42s)
