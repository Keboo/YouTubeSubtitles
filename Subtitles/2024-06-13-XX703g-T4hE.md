[great uh so tonight I think we are going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m05s)

[to dive back in the material design and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m07s)

[zaml there's a number of things I'd like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m09s)

[to get the 51 release out the door yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m11s)

[there's a lot of PRS open and then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m14s)

[there's one in particular that or one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m16s)

[issue that came up that I want to dive](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m18s)

[into around colors that feels like it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m20s)

[might be big enough to hold a release](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m23s)

[until a fix goes in we're going to check](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m24s)

[it so we'll see how it goes okay first](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m27s)

[up couple announcements one for anybody](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m31s)

[who is interested in uh eye](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m35s)

[configuration stuff uh there is a talk](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m38s)

[that I'm doing uh on eye configuration](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m43s)

[this is going to be mildly related to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m46s)

[generic host eye options eye](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m49s)

[configuration setting all of that stuff](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m51s)

[up uh number spinner might make the cut](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m53s)

[Izzy we're we're going to see it like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m56s)

[there's there's a chance there there is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h00m59s)

[a very real chance it's close enough](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m01s)

[that I might just push it over the edge](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m03s)

[and make it go um if you are watching a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m05s)

[recording of this video in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m08s)

[future it's going to be up on intellex](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m10s)

[helps me if people sign up for the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m21s)

[attendee numbers so yeah so if you feel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m24s)

[like doing that great uh if you want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m27s)

[works too uh okay one more thing so last](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m30s)

[week uh I was fighting with deploying an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m34s)

[Uno app out with velop Pac it turns out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m37s)

[uh after digging into it that I spent](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m41s)

[all of that time fighting with it only](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m43s)

[to discover that in fact the problem was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m45s)

[a bug that got introduced in the preview](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m50s)

[package of the velop PAC SDK that I was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m52s)

[using and it was biting me uh short](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m55s)

[version we we upgraded our Json uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h01m58s)

[parsing to use the new source generator](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m01s)

[stuff it's fast it's awesome it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m03s)

[wonderful um but in doing so a teen](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m04s)

[little bugs slipped in uh and it turns](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m07s)

[out teeny little bugs cause very big](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m10s)

[problems but I did get it in and working](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m12s)

[um it wasn't an exciting fix it was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m15s)

[adding an attribute and kicking a new](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m17s)

[package and then Poof Magic occurred and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m19s)

[everything worked um but I did go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m21s)

[through and right up so the the sample](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m23s)

[project is now actually merged into the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m27s)

[main](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m29s)

[uh velop Pac SDK so if anybody wants to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m30s)

[to see it and play with it um I did](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m33s)

[outline it here um I I sent it it off to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m36s)

[um some of the Uno folks um and they got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m40s)

[back to me with some answers to some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m43s)

[questions I had which was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m45s)

[great um the they did recommend moving](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m47s)

[this inside](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m51s)

[of or or I guess they asked more than](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m53s)

[recommended if we could move the um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m56s)

[velop pack stuff stuff inside of the app](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h02m59s)

[on launched or even the app's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m01s)

[Constructor to see to see if that was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m03s)

[possible and I think the answer is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m05s)

[probably the the only disadvantage I see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m07s)

[there is by doing it later your startup](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m10s)

[time is going to take a small hit](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m15s)

[because doing this vpac app build with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m18s)

[first run run like this may cause your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m21s)

[app to restart in the case of an update](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m23s)

[so if you don't care about the time that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m26s)

[that might add and it's not much like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m29s)

[how long does a UI framework take to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m32s)

[start most of the time we don't even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m33s)

[consider that when we're looking at app](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m34s)

[startup it's for the convenience sake](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m36s)

[it's probably worth moving it there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m38s)

[especially for a sample for people to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m40s)

[see because I ended up having to do some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m42s)

[fancy stuff around the wi UI head](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m44s)

[overriding the main because there the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m46s)

[the Uno head leverages the wi UI stuff](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m49s)

[which doesn't have a main method and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m52s)

[then you have to do some extra stuff to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m53s)

[get a main method and round and round](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m55s)

[and round we go it's it's ugly right but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m57s)

[it made it work the other thing that is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h03m59s)

[not covered here is um I only went](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m01s)

[through and showed uh producing out the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m04s)

[installers um for a single Target the I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m09s)

[want to when we actually put this into](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m13s)

[the velop pack docs I want to actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m14s)

[write out and show the docs showing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m17s)

[publishing for like both the the desktop](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m19s)

[the wiui and the Mac head I like I want](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m23s)

[all three of those and and show all of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m26s)

[that with working so I think that'll go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m29s)

[a long way to doing it so at some point](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m32s)

[I'm going to get that that going because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m35s)

[I I want this to be a nice solid thing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m38s)

[and then more importantly the the Velp](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m41s)

[Pack Flow hosted service works great](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m43s)

[once it was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m45s)

[going so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m46s)

[hurah um I've also been](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m49s)

[contemplating pushing the material](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m52s)

[design demo app into it just as that way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m54s)

[I can have a realish app and I can see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h04m57s)

[what like I I kind of want to get users](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m00s)

[hitting on it so I can see where the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m03s)

[potential problems](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m05s)

[are so you all might get to be my guinea](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m06s)

[pigs congratulations so that's where it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m09s)

[is so if anyone's interested the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m12s)

[sample is in the main velop pack repo](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m14s)

[under samples there's a read me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m17s)

[underneath the Uno sample um and all of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m19s)

[this lovely stuff in here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m23s)

[okay so couple things one I posted out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m25s)

[to the maintainers asking if people had](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m30s)

[anything they wanted to try to get in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m32s)

[for the 5.1 release and then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m33s)

[immediately PR started circling the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m37s)

[fences](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m40s)

[so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m41s)

[um yeah so there there's a lot of this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m43s)

[and so joris has been doing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m47s)

[amazing yeah this is definitely a a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m53s)

[proven run type](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m56s)

[situation uh uh this is technically a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h05m58s)

[breaking API change do I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m01s)

[care do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m08s)

[I it's breaking in that it's switching](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m10s)

[from a double to a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m13s)

[thickness however it's going to be a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m14s)

[source level backwards compatible change](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m17s)

[if people are only using this into the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m21s)

[zaml which is probably like nearly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m22s)

[everybody so I'm kind of tempted to not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m27s)

[care that it's a breaking API change](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m29s)

[because when you type in a um a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m32s)

[thickness object in zamel you you do you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m34s)

[like 9 comma 9 or just straight nine](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m36s)

[right and it goes through and works so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m39s)

[anybody who's specifying it in the zaml](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m40s)

[now currently is specifying a single](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m42s)

[number which will still translate to a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m44s)

[thickness unless they're accessing this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m47s)

[in code in which case then they have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m50s)

[compiler I'm going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m52s)

[to label it release notes will be my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m54s)

[compromise I'm going to label it release](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h06m58s)

[notes and call it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m00s)

[out but then I'm going to let it go then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m02s)

[we're going to let autom merge take this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m05s)

[one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m06s)

[okay next up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m08s)

[uh uh let's see fix for bug explained](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m15s)

[here uh was introduced here is it me did](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m20s)

[I make the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m24s)

[mistake oh no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m27s)

[let's see here to fix this now this code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m30s)

[proper let's see here uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m34s)

[see uh in the V5 how to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m40s)

[reproduce card's padding is double](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m45s)

[despite the fact that both of them let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m48s)

[just look so card with a padding of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m50s)

[six and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m54s)

[then border with a patty](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h07m57s)

[six ah okay something internally is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m01s)

[adding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m04s)

[extra oh because content presenter is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m09s)

[probably getting adding on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m13s)

[top yeah that'll do it because card](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m19s)

[deres from content](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m23s)

[control hey](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m27s)

[we where's the padding I'm looking for a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m33s)

[padding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m35s)

[binding oh yeah so there's the doubling](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m39s)

[one's there one's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m42s)

[there just make sure that the removal of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m45s)

[this one is the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m47s)

[place because there's a subtle there's a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m51s)

[subtle difference between removing this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m53s)

[line and removing this line here right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m55s)

[I'm sorry that text this tiny um because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h08m58s)

[this thing is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h09m02s)

[clipping actually this thing is going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h09m04s)

[clip on its](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h09m06s)

[outside take that back given the other](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h09m11s)

[properties I don't think it matters](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h09m14s)

[wrong right here so we'll stash it may I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m01s)

[may try to slip that in here in a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m05s)

[second okay so one thing I want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m07s)

[validate is that when I rerun the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m11s)

[generator so this resource generator is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m13s)

[project underneath properties we have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m23s)

[this launch settings. Json so you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m26s)

[see I've kind of pre because this is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m29s)

[console application I've pre canned some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m31s)

[man line args that I want to do so you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m34s)

[can see generate theming generate icons](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m37s)

[generate swatches generate brushes right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m39s)

[so I want to I want to just run this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m41s)

[because in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m43s)

[theory it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h19m46s)

[consequential differences that's fine](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h20m43s)

[then okay so that's good so after after](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h20m45s)

[that has been sitting open that I want](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m31s)

[to double check so to be clear the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m32s)

[change here is perfectly fine however](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m35s)

[what I am wanting to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m38s)

[confirm and I I'll just for people's for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m41s)

[people's memory since it's since I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m44s)

[stared at this for a minute before I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m46s)

[actually figured out what was going on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m48s)

[right this goes here back](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m51s)

[back get out of here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m56s)

[what's all on those tabs but I want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h21m59s)

[just share something okay so the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m01s)

[change here is very very subtle right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m04s)

[wow that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m08s)

[Edge make up your mind okay so the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m11s)

[change here is real subtle so you'll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m15s)

[note you can kind of see this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m17s)

[um do this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m22s)

[get off of there okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m30s)

[this right and then let's see if to draw](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m33s)

[an arrow yeah there we go so ignore that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m36s)

[arrow that Arrow so you see that teeny](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m39s)

[little extra space doesn't exist here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m41s)

[right so the difference is when you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m45s)

[applying the padding whether you apply](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m46s)

[the padding conceptually kind of inside](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m49s)

[the scroll viewer or outside of it right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m52s)

[because the padding here is shrinking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m55s)

[the size of the viewport of the scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h22m58s)

[viewer versus the padding here on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m00s)

[right is being applied to the content](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m03s)

[inside of the scroll viewer so it just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m06s)

[kind of makes you have more stuff to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m08s)

[scroll right if you were to add top](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m10s)

[padding of 100 You' have 100 extra](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m12s)

[pixels in that you could scroll up and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m14s)

[down through versus here you cut off](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m16s)

[your content by 100 pixels right so one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m19s)

[so left is current right is proposed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m24s)

[change and I'm not opposed to the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m27s)

[the part that I'm not confident](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m31s)

[in is what default WPF behavior is and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m33s)

[that I want to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m37s)

[check that I want to go check because at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m38s)

[the end of the day this is all about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m42s)

[padding on a scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m44s)

[viewer right and what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m46s)

[the and what the behavior should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m50s)

[be uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h23m53s)

[yeah keep the one on the left well so I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m01s)

[think the correct answer is going to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m04s)

[whatever whatever default WPF behavior](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m07s)

[is is probably the answer I want to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m11s)

[with because I want I I want this to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m13s)

[um no that's not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m19s)

[it right okay MK dur uh roll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m23s)

[viewer test right because I want it to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m28s)

[be the material design Library one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h24m33s)

[not my my muscle memory really when I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m06s)

[see the stuff come up I really want tab](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m09s)

[to be take the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m12s)

[suggestion not right arrow like my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m15s)

[finger is not near the right arrow right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m17s)

[arrow is not in my musle memory why are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m19s)

[we doing this okay so am I doing this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m23s)

[what right so we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m26s)

[here we're going to do a grid uh grid.](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m28s)

[column](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m32s)

[definitions see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m33s)

[here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m35s)

[definition yep okay two](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m37s)

[columns two grids put a scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m40s)

[viewer right and then we the the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m44s)

[argument here is around padding and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m47s)

[we're going to do padding of I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m49s)

[know 50 make it big and obvious right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m51s)

[and then inside of here we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m54s)

[do a border no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h25m56s)

[order we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m01s)

[do uh height of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m03s)

[1,000 and width](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m08s)

[of I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m11s)

[know](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m13s)

[200 matter no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m15s)

[500 I don't know why I did the second](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m19s)

[column some reason I had in my head that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m22s)

[I needed to test two things but I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m25s)

[realizing I only really need to test the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m26s)

[one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m28s)

[thing what default behavior is oh right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m28s)

[and if you don't give your border a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m32s)

[color you can't see it right so let's go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m33s)

[background red](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m36s)

[here uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m38s)

[background uh let's do light blue here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m40s)

[right so we'll do that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m44s)

[okay the padding on a scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m53s)

[viewer default WPF Behavior applies to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h26m57s)

[the view](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m00s)

[Port right so let's let's try this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m02s)

[um text](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m06s)

[block and then okay co-pilot now is your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m09s)

[time to shine now is your time to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m13s)

[shine uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m16s)

[write 100 lines of random test text here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m19s)

[go go co-pilot make up something you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m25s)

[useful I can only assume you're about to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m31s)

[do Latin come](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m34s)

[on I could have Googled for the Latin](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m35s)

[already maybe I should have been more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m39s)

[explicit in my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m41s)

[prompt I know AI is bad at counting so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m46s)

[sometimes you ask](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m49s)

[for 100 and it it's not always](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m50s)

[accurate the problem when you let AI be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h27m55s)

[creative](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m00s)

[uh sure now we're going to have to work](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m02s)

[on your definition of 100 lines but you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m06s)

[know](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m09s)

[what here's what we do we do this right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m10s)

[text wrapping rap](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m13s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m19s)

[yeah so I think I think we reject the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m24s)

[change think we do I'm just trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m30s)

[decide because on one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m33s)

[hand yeah like I like most of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m39s)

[this corresponding shows the unexpected](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m43s)

[C off text because the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m46s)

[padding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m51s)

[yeah what's what what was the it here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m54s)

[let scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h28m59s)

[padding currently the padding I was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m01s)

[scroll because we have this attached](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m03s)

[property which is making things a little](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m05s)

[more interesting is ignored](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m07s)

[using because the padding otherwise](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m11s)

[would result in two early cut off on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m13s)

[content with rolling](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m15s)

[um yeah because I I get the idea is so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m35s)

[the the simple way to solve this problem](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m39s)

[is you apply it to the the thing inside](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m41s)

[the scroll viewer right you give it a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m44s)

[margin but that's not a solution that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m47s)

[applies](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m50s)

[generically you make it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m53s)

[configurable um I mean it's always](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m55s)

[possible to make it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h29m59s)

[configurable it it it's always this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m02s)

[one of the hard areas of figuring out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m04s)

[what is the best thing because we do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m07s)

[have this scroll viewer assist ignore](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m11s)

[padding I want to go look at what I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m16s)

[want to I want to understand the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m19s)

[implementation of a little bit because I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m21s)

[think that's mudding the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m24s)

[waters um in terms of what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m26s)

[is what is actually there I think it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m30s)

[meant to be an internal property if I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m33s)

[remember](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m35s)

[right because occasionally we want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m37s)

[set set it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m42s)

[differently trophy or assist ignore](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m45s)

[padding is it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m49s)

[wait oh there's I'm like is it ever used](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m53s)

[I'm just blind and stupid](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m56s)

[okay so if ignore padding is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h30m58s)

[false right if ignore padding is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m02s)

[false then the margin of the scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m06s)

[content](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m10s)

[presenter gets the padding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m11s)

[set](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m20s)

[yeah then content p in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m22s)

[silly yeah yeah it's really tempted to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m29s)

[to change it to something like that I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m32s)

[the other drawback with a lot of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m35s)

[configurable options and this bit us](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m36s)

[quite a bit with Xbox before Nikolai did](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m39s)

[a bunch of cleanup is there was so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m42s)

[many configurable](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m46s)

[switches that trying to test every](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m49s)

[because every time you add a switch the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m52s)

[the complexity of the combination of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m54s)

[this or specific whenever you add a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m56s)

[switch that interacts with something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h31m59s)

[else the number of possible](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m00s)

[configurations it goes up what is it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m03s)

[exponentially right could you go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m06s)

[one uh four nine and it just keeps](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m09s)

[skyrocketing like it's the value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m12s)

[squared which is sucky beyond belief](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m15s)

[because I think on text block we got to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m19s)

[four five and that was at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m21s)

[unmanageable level like it's like I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m23s)

[just we kept getting bugs of oh if you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m25s)

[configure these two on and this one off](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m28s)

[it doesn't work it's like oh dear](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m30s)

[Heavens don't do that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m32s)

[um because some of them also like didn't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m35s)

[make sense together and it it was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m37s)

[weird yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m41s)

[tempted not because this is when](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m44s)

[false the padding is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m48s)

[applied to the presenter](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m51s)

[and when it's true the padding will be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h32m58s)

[ignored which makes sense with the name](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m01s)

[the padding will not get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m03s)

[applied](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m07s)

[um because in this case the idea is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m09s)

[wanting to change the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m12s)

[padding because there's technically not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m16s)

[that big of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m18s)

[um don't set padding in here do we by](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m20s)

[default we do see here's the thing the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m25s)

[default value of this padding I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m28s)

[believe not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m32s)

[selection the default value of padding I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m36s)

[believe is zero in here and that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m39s)

[that's what's giving me pause right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m41s)

[because this sample](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m45s)

[code thing is he's got his ignore](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m47s)

[padding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m51s)

[false yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h33m55s)

[yeah this is hard because I do kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m03s)

[like the change but I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m06s)

[also don't like that it's different from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m08s)

[wpfd](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m17s)

[oh um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m19s)

[G to punt this out of here I'm not going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m29s)

[to close it because I I it feels like I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m32s)

[want some discussion on this but I am](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m34s)

[going to punt it from the the current](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m37s)

[really Andrew welcome welcome](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m41s)

[welcome feel like I had a question for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m46s)

[you Andrew there was there was some wiui](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m48s)

[stuff I was doing the other day and I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m50s)

[got I got bit and I was like oh I bet](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m52s)

[you Andrew has a video on this and I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m55s)

[forgot I it'll come back to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m56s)

[me uh let's see padding equal control](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h34m59s)

[content padding equal content then you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m03s)

[can edit to a sensible default yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m05s)

[something like that might be a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m08s)

[possibility maybe I'll float that in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m09s)

[here as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m11s)

[on Uno last week and they they operate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m37s)

[very similar with multiple heads like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m41s)

[how old school zamar and forms used to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m43s)

[work and one of them is a wi UI head and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m45s)

[it I think the fact that I was inside of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m48s)

[Uno was making my life slightly more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m51s)

[confusing because I was trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h35m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m05s)

[solution uh with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m07s)

[a attached property for what did you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m09s)

[call it is he content padding yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m13s)

[yeah like I said I don't want to reject](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m31s)

[the pr because I kind of like where it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m33s)

[going but I also don't want to break](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m36s)

[stuff uh okay that handles that I know](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m38s)

[you're really excited on this one Izzy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m43s)

[we're going to circle back to it in a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m45s)

[minute there's one more issue I want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m47s)

[dig dig into because this is the one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m49s)

[this is the one that scares me a little](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m52s)

[bit the the new colors one this want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m55s)

[double check](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m57s)

[let's I think a lot of these things we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h38m59s)

[can uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m04s)

[see this one we haven't been able to get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m06s)

[a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m10s)

[good explanation for so this this we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m11s)

[will this one I think I'm going to just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m16s)

[immediately punt into](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m18s)

[52 or a couple of these we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m22s)

[just throw out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m25s)

[um that one I want to look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m28s)

[at let's see this is waiting on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m32s)

[feedback](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m39s)

[um how old is this December](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m42s)

[29th uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m46s)

[see February this was two days ago so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m48s)

[this is fine but I think Nikolai is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m52s)

[right with the attached property so I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m54s)

[suspect that's just going to be a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m55s)

[resolve](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h39m56s)

[treeview](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m02s)

[uh think the attached property do not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m09s)

[apply to the treew](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m12s)

[control](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m21s)

[yeah I don't yeah the ignore Patty not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m23s)

[being applied is more more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m25s)

[a like it's not being applied and it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m29s)

[not intentional but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m33s)

[it's that that one we may or may not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m36s)

[just go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m39s)

[fix this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m41s)

[guy this is the issue I'm going to move](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m43s)

[that 52 we'll let it we'll let it get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m47s)

[re-evaluated um let's see this guy here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m51s)

[is going to get punted to 52](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m54s)

[because so far the memory dumps we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h40m58s)

[haven't gotten anything actionable out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m01s)

[of uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m04s)

[see Di time view is not the same as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m06s)

[runtime yeah this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m13s)

[is yeah we'll we'll double check this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m22s)

[this may or may not be completely](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m24s)

[fixable either](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m26s)

[um because I suspect it's the designer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m28s)

[just being dumb okay so that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m30s)

[said where did the this one this is the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m34s)

[guy so this is the one that I'm very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m37s)

[intrigued to test](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m40s)

[with and it's very convenient that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m49s)

[they called out at least several test](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h41m54s)

[cases uh but have you gotten very quiet](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m01s)

[I don't think so checking checking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m04s)

[checking test test test hang on believe](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m07s)

[it or not we have the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m11s)

[capabilities let me know if that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m13s)

[better for you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m15s)

[yzzy because at least](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m18s)

[uh on my end it shows that my my output](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m21s)

[stream should be roughly the same volume](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m24s)

[okay uh let's see clearly see in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m28s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m30s)

[mode Let's see this all doesn't really](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m34s)

[match the materials of three it doesn't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m37s)

[go from lowest surface to highest](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m39s)

[surface uh let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m42s)

[oh sorry one moment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h42m58s)

[please](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m08s)

[button](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m16s)

[um if these surface ones intrigue](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m19s)

[me I don't think we have these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m22s)

[um I used the lowest layer of the app](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m29s)

[but now it doesn't work anymore for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m32s)

[that in light mode instead the situation](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m34s)

[wasn't great either I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m37s)

[these are ones that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m40s)

[the first use the surface as lowest to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m47s)

[highest like this background toolbar](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m50s)

[paper](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m53s)

[card yeah and this is one of the issues](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m54s)

[that we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h43m57s)

[have is so in material design they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m00s)

[don't they they talk about everything at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m07s)

[these different layers all the way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m09s)

[through which works well to a point um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m11s)

[over the beeping](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m17s)

[doors yeah so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m19s)

[the yeah so these surface brushes are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m23s)

[ones that are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m26s)

[um are are ones that they've defined](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m28s)

[which is fine it it's just the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m31s)

[problem with the surfaces doesn't work](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m33s)

[very well in practice inside of a WPF](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m36s)

[application because you can't do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m39s)

[surfaces at the surface level like that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m44s)

[in in some cases like things end up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m47s)

[getting on top of others based upon](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m49s)

[their control and so because we have so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m52s)

[having surface brushes like this totally](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m55s)

[fine this is this probably works the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m56s)

[problem is is when you try to associate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h44m58s)

[these to control level ones the only way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m01s)

[you can say something like toolbar then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m04s)

[paper then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m07s)

[card is if you are diligent about how](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m09s)

[you use each of these controls which](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m13s)

[doesn't always play out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m15s)

[nicely um maybe with a couple more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m18s)

[surfaces um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m24s)

[could be using some way to change the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m27s)

[color but I wouldn't know how yeah I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m29s)

[wouldn't want to use elevation because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m30s)

[elevation is a drop shadow and it's not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m32s)

[even though it's designed to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m37s)

[show uh distance it's not designed to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m39s)

[control the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m42s)

[distance um let's see we could keep do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m44s)

[by fixing color so the all more maybe](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m48s)

[with a couple more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m50s)

[surfaces yeah so proposed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m58s)

[background and I don't think you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h45m59s)

[actually want this I don't go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m01s)

[look material](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m04s)

[design I don't think their proposed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m07s)

[background goes all the way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m10s)

[black CU this proposal of black 1000 is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m12s)

[like solid](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m16s)

[black and I'm fairly confident that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m18s)

[theirs is like you can even see here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m22s)

[some of these things just visually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m24s)

[looking at it these aren't AR pure black](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m25s)

[because it's not pure black and not Pure](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m28s)

[White because that's very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m29s)

[jarring uh unless you're going for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m31s)

[a um like a high contrast theme or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m35s)

[similar uh let's see built-in Dark theme](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m39s)

[colors and it's worth noting depend like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m44s)

[some of these things could be getting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m47s)

[bit oh that's an interesting thing that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m48s)

[I didn't think about if you have the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m50s)

[automatic uh color contrast system going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m53s)

[in um that which is I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h46m57s)

[on by default that will definitely mess](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m01s)

[with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m03s)

[this uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m04s)

[okay the color rolls yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m07s)

[yeah yeah and this is this is where this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m17s)

[gets hard for me right is if you follow](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m19s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m22s)

[strictly I don't know which of these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m23s)

[brushes apply to which controls because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m26s)

[I'm a library not an app an app can make](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m30s)

[that decision a library](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m33s)

[can't so it gets very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m41s)

[challenging](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m43s)

[um yeah primary secondary tertiary yep](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m49s)

[air surface](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h47m53s)

[yeah so these are going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m03s)

[be do they have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m10s)

[static Baseline](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m14s)

[colors uh figma using the material](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m17s)

[design oh that's the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m24s)

[oh kind of just didn't want to have to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m27s)

[actually go through figma all the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m31s)

[way primary](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m33s)

[colors secondary surface](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m35s)

[colors surface on Surface we go that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m42s)

[what we're looking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m45s)

[for so these are more akin to where we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m49s)

[want things to land](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h48m52s)

[and I'm not opposed to Jenning these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m00s)

[brushes I'm just I'm thinking I probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m01s)

[don't want to Jen these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m04s)

[brushes gen these brushes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m12s)

[on um on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m15s)

[controls because you you'll know like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m18s)

[the surface](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m20s)

[tint is somewhat driven](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m21s)

[by this guy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m24s)

[right uh outline colors outline outline](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m28s)

[variant yeah and that's that's the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m38s)

[that's one of the hard Parts here is as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m40s)

[a library I can't always make the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m41s)

[decision because I don't know how](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m44s)

[something's going to be used so we have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m45s)

[to pick a default and go with it and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m48s)

[trust that app developers will fix it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m50s)

[okay but I think there's a couple things](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m53s)

[here that can probably be addressed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m55s)

[one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h49m58s)

[um I think paper's Dead begin](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m04s)

[with it is except for they brought in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m10s)

[okay so a couple](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m14s)

[things I think the obsolete ones I want](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m17s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m21s)

[review these don't look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m22s)

[don't look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m27s)

[that old paper new](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m31s)

[paper they're a little](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m35s)

[different](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m42s)

[the Old and New toolbars Look darn near](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m45s)

[identical if I was guessing like I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m48s)

[even see the seam between those two but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m50s)

[like the paper I can see the seam in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m53s)

[middle right it's right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m55s)

[there but I cannot](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h50m58s)

[see it the background one is the one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m03s)

[that confuses me the most because that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m06s)

[one feels like that one should be that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m08s)

[far off so and on light theme it seems](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m09s)

[fine I can't see the seam](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m14s)

[there could just be my bad eyes but I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m17s)

[very far zoomed in toolbar is close](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m20s)

[paper's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m23s)

[wrong card looks fine to me so I I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m24s)

[wondering I think I think we need to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m36s)

[review the background brush in Dark](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m39s)

[theme on the obsolete](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m42s)

[brushes because that is probably biting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m44s)

[us um I want to review](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m49s)

[card uh we should probably review](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m53s)

[toolbar and paper and light](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h51m56s)

[theme H heck we'll we'll review this one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m01s)

[too why not the so I I'd like to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m04s)

[understand how those things got that far](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m08s)

[off we can look about creating new](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m09s)

[brushes one of the other things that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m15s)

[interesting is right now we do not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m18s)

[have uh let's see duplicate we do do not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m23s)

[have separate brushes for material](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m26s)

[design 2 and material design](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m28s)

[three so that that gets to be a little](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m32s)

[more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m36s)

[interesting the color system I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m39s)

[think this one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m41s)

[has I don't think this one has the nice](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m45s)

[surface colors does it 2014 color](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m48s)

[palette CU these are the colors but I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m52s)

[looking for the actual](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m54s)

[like they have these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h52m57s)

[and yeah I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m06s)

[see yeah I might split this issue into](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m13s)

[two parts because one part is the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m15s)

[brushes that is probably worth](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m30s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m41s)

[yeah yeah and the the so to answer the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m46s)

[question on how colors were](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m49s)

[chosen uh I don't want to say randomly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m51s)

[but the the color system was originally](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m55s)

[based on material design 2 because this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h53m58s)

[Library started before it existed and so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m00s)

[the 50 steps don't exist beyond the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m02s)

[first](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m05s)

[one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m07s)

[so they were originally based on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m09s)

[this is the short short answer to this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m12s)

[question so and I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m15s)

[think and and with material design 3](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m20s)

[they got rid of those things](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m23s)

[in favor of just defining](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m27s)

[these because it's nice for a library to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m31s)

[provide that level of granularity but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m34s)

[it's not actually needed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m36s)

[for an app like an app isn't going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m39s)

[use all those they're going to define](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m42s)

[basically these and be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m44s)

[done right and so this is actually one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m49s)

[of the things that at one point we had](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m52s)

[we were building out a theme Builder and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m54s)

[I I kind of want to Circle back to that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m56s)

[at some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m58s)

[point](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h54m59s)

[because the library has lots of these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m01s)

[brushes but most of the time I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m04s)

[think people need all of them like I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m06s)

[am tempted to to build a little thing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m09s)

[that generates you a little theme. zaml](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m11s)

[file that you can just drop in and be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m14s)

[done right because I could also make it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m16s)

[a little more efficient](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m18s)

[too](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m20s)

[um uh let's see also a simple way to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m22s)

[substitute the default themes with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m25s)

[custom](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m28s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m30s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m41s)

[so if you are wanting a custom theme on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m43s)

[this one the solution would be don't go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m47s)

[through the the carpie side this is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m50s)

[convenience for people who want to use](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m53s)

[the built-in stuff if you're wanting a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m55s)

[custom one um what you do is you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h55m57s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m02s)

[go uh within your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m05s)

[app right in your app.](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m08s)

[zaml you just specify the resource](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m10s)

[dictionaries and then you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m14s)

[done right so if you want if you want](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m17s)

[your own custom resource dictionary you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m19s)

[do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m22s)

[this and then you're done right the AL](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m23s)

[the alternative is if you want to do it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m26s)

[in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m29s)

[code you can you can get a hold of one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m30s)

[of these things and build up the C the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m33s)

[generated C file which just has all of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m35s)

[the brushes in code that you can set and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m38s)

[go from there and there's some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m41s)

[convenience methods on that to to set](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m42s)

[everything this is also why building a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m44s)

[theme Builder thingy would be nice CU](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m47s)

[we're getting quite a few brushes like I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m50s)

[don't expect people to actually write](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m53s)

[them all what I expect most people would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m54s)

[do is go to the repo copy the one that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m56s)

[there change the values they care about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h56m59s)

[and drop that into their thing but we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m01s)

[could have a theme Builder do the same](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m04s)

[thing okay so obsolete brushes being far](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m06s)

[off that is the bug that we want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m09s)

[address today the rest of this ticket we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m10s)

[will address at a later](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m13s)

[Point okay so uh you uh don't care](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m15s)

[anymore go away uh don't care go away](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m18s)

[thank you okay so I want to test the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m21s)

[how was a good way for me to test the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m27s)

[V4](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m30s)

[brushes and the new ones I think the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m32s)

[easiest way for me to do this is to just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m36s)

[grab the demo app for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m41s)

[V5 and the demo app](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m44s)

[for V4 and call it good that's probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m48s)

[the easiest way for me to compare these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m51s)

[things](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m54s)

[okay so we're going to grab that one and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m56s)

[then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m58s)

[releases and we'll go back and grab](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h57m59s)

[v49](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m05s)

[assets app](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m08s)

[okay to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m11s)

[that I'm going to move this over here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m15s)

[and I'm going to just start renaming](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m17s)

[some of these things so that I can keep](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m18s)

[track of what which one's which uh hang](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m20s)

[on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m23s)

[here copy copy copy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m33s)

[copy okay so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m37s)

[B5 and then I realize you can't see so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m41s)

[stand by copy paste](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h58m45s)

[okay so and then this will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m01s)

[be V4 okay we got V4 V5 let's go look at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m03s)

[the uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m11s)

[sure lach](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m14s)

[that no I trust it I literally just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m16s)

[downloaded my own app okay so there's V4](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m19s)

[we're going to put V4 on the left](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m23s)

[and then I'm realizing it'd be really](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m26s)

[nice if my demo apps came with uh we'll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m28s)

[compare Net 7 to net7 not that it should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m31s)

[make it difference the demo app really](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m33s)

[should have the version on it somewhere](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m36s)

[like title or the heading bar or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m39s)

[something okay so there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m41s)

[there okay I mean the first thing I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m47s)

[noticing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=00h59m49s)

[those don't look that far off to me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m01s)

[but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m05s)

[go uh let's see where is let's check](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m09s)

[pallet I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m13s)

[guess this was a bug I think we have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m16s)

[fixed not we should go fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m19s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m22s)

[I'm having](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m30s)

[trouble okay we're g to we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m34s)

[just have to start snooping these things](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m36s)

[because I'm I'm not seeing the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m38s)

[difference actually you know what let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m42s)

[do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m43s)

[this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m44s)

[screenshot grab this right we're going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m46s)

[to go paint](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m53s)

[this suck over here and then we go paste](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h00m56s)

[and yeah sure great crop okay so show me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m00s)

[the difference](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m04s)

[between this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m06s)

[color this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m08s)

[color okay so they are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m11s)

[different uh information links on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m15s)

[demo app are broken they are Andrew they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m18s)

[they should be fixed in latest main what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m22s)

[the the unfortunate I I just can't fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m26s)

[it in old versions of the demo app the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m29s)

[we reorganized the repo and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m32s)

[so there's not a great way to for to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m35s)

[update links so like the the break for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m38s)

[most of them is things moved inside of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m41s)

[an SRC](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m43s)

[directory like that that change there is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m45s)

[what broke most things through there but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m48s)

[latest um latest Master should have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m51s)

[should have a fix for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m55s)

[it cuz that that was a a breaking change](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h01m57s)

[we reorganized the repo and decided to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m01s)

[just do a Scorch Durst](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m05s)

[approach okay so let's check the card](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m07s)

[then up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m10s)

[above](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m11s)

[there no no no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m13s)

[don't never apologize for the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m15s)

[interruption I love them okay so there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m17s)

[is some slight](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m21s)

[difference 9](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m24s)

[66 okay there are a handful of tiny](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m28s)

[things here then I guess the question is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m32s)

[which](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m35s)

[brush is it play on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m36s)

[these let's go here let's go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m41s)

[here and then I am interested](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m44s)

[in I think this is going to float me all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m47s)

[the way up to the top so we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m50s)

[just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m52s)

[go until we find it it's probably at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h02m57s)

[window probably all the way at the top](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m03s)

[for people who are curious what I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m06s)

[doing it's just left arrow and I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m07s)

[intentionally watching this background](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m09s)

[property because at some point it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m12s)

[going to get set to a dark color and I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m14s)

[think it's going to get set to a dark](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m16s)

[color at the very top level retrospect](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m18s)

[starting there okay so it's set at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m21s)

[border of the main window which is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m25s)

[template item of the main window itself](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m27s)

[which means it is set here right so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m30s)

[material design paper so this is should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m35s)

[be 32 32 32 I think if we go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m38s)

[here uh yes that is the hex value we got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m44s)

[there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m47s)

[32s okay so that means that the obsolete](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m48s)

[brush as four is on the left](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m53s)

[we check this one and we look at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h03m57s)

[32 okay so there is a shift the old one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m10s)

[was 30 so how can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m14s)

[I go through and find all of the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m16s)

[differences of what the brushes used to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m19s)

[be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m22s)

[and I could do them one by one that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m25s)

[just really bloody](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m27s)

[annoying um actually I guess I've got a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m29s)

[list here don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m31s)

[I I've got a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m34s)

[list we could just grab](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m38s)

[them uh from in here that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m41s)

[defaults um let's see here one of these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m46s)

[guys](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m50s)

[contains yeah so here is all all the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m52s)

[values we could just check them this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h04m57s)

[way if we go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m00s)

[color and we could just walk down the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m04s)

[obsolete brushes and just check them](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m07s)

[because we want them to match whatever](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m10s)

[the V4](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m13s)

[was let's let's do that that's probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m15s)

[just as easy as anything else then we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m18s)

[can fix all of the obsolete brushes to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m21s)

[make them match with v49](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m24s)

[was which is as far back as I'm willing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m27s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m48s)

[so oh but this is not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m53s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h05m58s)

[why this isn't meant to fix the colors](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m03s)

[interesting that is very very very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m23s)

[interesting because when we collapsed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m27s)

[the colors there wasn't a direct](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m29s)

[them](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m35s)

[okay okay I just decided this one's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m37s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m39s)

[punted](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m40s)

[because and I arguably need to clean up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m45s)

[the wording in this because I just spent](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m48s)

[a bunch of time looking at this not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m51s)

[realizing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m52s)

[that new colors don't match old V4](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m54s)

[colors I should have inferred from this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h06m57s)

[that this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m00s)

[was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m02s)

[expected so the them not matching the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m04s)

[old is completely](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m08s)

[expected because there was we had](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m14s)

[inconsistencies in the colors in V4 and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m16s)

[we standardized them in V5 so I can't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m19s)

[actually put the old ones](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m22s)

[back because that would just put the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m24s)

[inconsistencies](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m26s)

[back](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m33s)

[um yeah I'm GNA have to I'll spend some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m35s)

[time putting together an actual](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m38s)

[thoughtful reply here because this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m40s)

[one that needs to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m42s)

[be thought through but it is not one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m44s)

[that needs to be worked on or a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m47s)

[V5 one we're going to punt it to v52](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m51s)

[okay poof look at that look at that see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m56s)

[Milestones get smaller hey what's left](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h07m58s)

[in here seven open leave that for the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m00s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m05s)

[um this one here is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m07s)

[interesting when Rose span property is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m10s)

[used uh let's see I have an expander](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m14s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m18s)

[blah I mean let's this seems bad let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m20s)

[test it real quick so what what is the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m25s)

[setup here we've got a grid with some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m27s)

[columns and shared size Scopes enabled](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m30s)

[on them I'm immediately noticing width](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m32s)

[of Auto which is a recipe for disaster](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m34s)

[with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m37s)

[expanders let's see in one of these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m38s)

[grids I have an image using the row span](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m40s)

[and column](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m43s)

[span](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m47s)

[okay row zero](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m49s)

[it bothers me that only the grid columns](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m55s)

[are shown and the bug is with row](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h08m57s)

[span um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m03s)

[Okay Ross ban property](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m14s)

[um compiled solution seems to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m18s)

[temporarily solve the problem but any](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m21s)

[attempt to edit the examl causes the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m22s)

[problem again](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m24s)

[well let's see if we can reproduce this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m31s)

[really quick um because this is an easy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m33s)

[thing to test but I have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m35s)

[hunch this isn't going to be easily](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m39s)

[reproducible because I suspect it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m45s)

[going to be highly specific](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m47s)

[to clear this out I don't want to look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m51s)

[at you away](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m53s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h09m56s)

[expander cuz I I I suspect the issue is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m00s)

[potentially Rose](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m04s)

[span and not knowing the the height of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m06s)

[these but I have a feeling I know how to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m10s)

[recreate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m12s)

[recreate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m17s)

[this and it's probably difficult inside](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m18s)

[of here because of how we structure our](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m21s)

[stuff um because ours are inside of a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m27s)

[stack panel and a stack panel inherently](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m30s)

[collapses to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m33s)

[content um let's see here so let's just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m36s)

[grab an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m39s)

[expander](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m43s)

[and let's just whack the whole](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m46s)

[thing see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m49s)

[grid grid r](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m52s)

[definitions row definitions height](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h10m56s)

[Auto right it's going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m00s)

[be something of this nature then it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m02s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m06s)

[be see this something of this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m08s)

[nature and then it's going to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m14s)

[something like grid R](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m56s)

[um fact the issue is with the bander](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h11m57s)

[trying to know the size of it container](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m03s)

[when you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m09s)

[have Auto](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m11s)

[set](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m13s)

[um uh but in the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m15s)

[above it is only showing the grid](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m20s)

[would be helpful to see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m30s)

[aoes the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m40s)

[issue so we're going to do that we're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m42s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m44s)

[do let's see let's go with waiting on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m46s)

[feedback and then we are going to pick](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m49s)

[the evaluation and we are going to punt](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m52s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h12m57s)

[done so much easier when you just punt](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m00s)

[tisues uh let's see design view is not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m03s)

[the same as runtime this one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m06s)

[is very interesting to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m11s)

[me specifically because let's see I set](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m15s)

[up a fresh project exactly as the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m18s)

[getting started](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m20s)

[ex](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m22s)

[um and there's a discrepancy in how is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m24s)

[the displayed light to dark let's go and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m26s)

[check this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m30s)

[because like I think this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m33s)

[is it's probably the exact behavior that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m35s)

[we're seeing here right like if I launch](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m38s)

[this demo app I'm willing to bet this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m41s)

[expander shows white text rather than](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m44s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m47s)

[text going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m49s)

[guess that that is the case](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m51s)

[and I strongly suspect that it is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h13m58s)

[related](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m01s)

[to designer being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m03s)

[dumb let's see so if we go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m06s)

[expander yeah so it has white Tech so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m09s)

[same bug still exists so the bug is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m13s)

[there problem is is is there anything we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m16s)

[can actually do to fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m20s)

[this it's interesting to me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m23s)

[that I mean this one down here is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m30s)

[showing the incorrect one I I think the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m33s)

[solution here is probably just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m37s)

[doing so this is something worth noting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m40s)

[um one of the coolest tricks that you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m43s)

[can do is you can set design Time](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m45s)

[Properties and people are usually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m47s)

[familiar with this design height design](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m49s)

[width because those show up in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m51s)

[default templates](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m53s)

[but you can actually do Deco in anything](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m55s)

[you want so you can do Deco in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m57s)

[foreground red right now my foreground](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h14m59s)

[is red but my foreground is only](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m03s)

[red during design time this is the cool](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m07s)

[part like you can do Deon anything you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m11s)

[would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m13s)

[like right and it will work for design](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m14s)

[Time stuff but not runtime](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m19s)

[stuff so the question then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m22s)

[is how does it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m27s)

[know to pick up the darker the darker](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m30s)

[color](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m34s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m36s)

[background but not the darker color for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m39s)

[the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m42s)

[Tex it is probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m44s)

[because and actually I think we can we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m48s)

[can we can go even simpler right we can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m50s)

[probably do text block text F right we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m52s)

[can probably get it all the way down to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m56s)

[this simple if we turn this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h15m58s)

[off right really really hard to see but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m01s)

[there is in fact boo right there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m05s)

[right and it's only dark because it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m10s)

[seen that if I go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m14s)

[here and I change the default](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m17s)

[theme from inherit to light I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m20s)

[think that that doesn't change the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m24s)

[background of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m26s)

[this so this is just an artifact of how](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m30s)

[the designer works and not something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m36s)

[that we can actually fix but I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m38s)

[sharing this trick is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m40s)

[something is something that would go a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m45s)

[long](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m48s)

[way cuz they did go through and set this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m49s)

[you know let's double check it at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m54s)

[window level cuz this is the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m55s)

[control](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h16m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m01s)

[uh uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m05s)

[see into this after](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m10s)

[the5](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m14s)

[release um I don't think there is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m16s)

[lot Library can do to fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m21s)

[it however you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m26s)

[can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m30s)

[um oh isn't the designer set based on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m34s)

[your OS theme and not your app thing I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m37s)

[think it's based on your IDE](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m39s)

[theme but I I think your IDE](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m44s)

[theme it either follows your Os or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m48s)

[defaults to match or similar I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m51s)

[remember](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m54s)

[but that's a good that's a good point](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m55s)

[Let's test that because if I go through](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m56s)

[and do tools](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h17m58s)

[options right and I go through and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m01s)

[change my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m03s)

[theme uh if I change this to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m05s)

[the the default](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m09s)

[blue](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m12s)

[right and this is this is where it gets](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m14s)

[oh my word I forgot what Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m16s)

[looks like when I do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m18s)

[this it's if I do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m23s)

[this and we Zoom this sucker in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m25s)

[right it has nice light](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m29s)

[text this light text is because it's on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m32s)

[the white border like it doesn't change](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m36s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m40s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m42s)

[um and if I go through](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m53s)

[here just CL like what are you talking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h18m56s)

[merged do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m02s)

[this text block text Bo here we go boom](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m06s)

[all right so the text here is dark on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m13s)

[light and then if I go tools options and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m16s)

[I switch this guy back to Dark theme](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m19s)

[the designer doesn't even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m28s)

[update um or is this thing set to light](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h19m31s)

[retest the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h21m14s)

[behavior that I see is that the designer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h21m18s)

[does follow](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h21m23s)

[the uh themee](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h21m25s)

[let's see here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m26s)

[so um open the solution and see how](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m27s)

[badly were](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m31s)

[broken okay step one do you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m38s)

[compile I mean we did just rebase after](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m44s)

[a major refactor of the uh repo so you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m46s)

[know there's that's that's never a an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m49s)

[easy thing to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m52s)

[thankfully though we did like um Michael](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m55s)

[when he did it he was very kind and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h28m59s)

[intentionally kept rebasing his big](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m03s)

[refactor Branch um until we got a lot of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m05s)

[our major PRS in and then we're like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m08s)

[okay now do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m11s)

[it so it was it was an INT we knew](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m13s)

[everything was going to break but it was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m16s)

[intentional and it ended up not being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m19s)

[nearly as bad as we expected like there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m23s)

[was just a handful](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m24s)

[oh you really hang on okay does the file](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m28s)

[exist the file](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m35s)

[exists that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m38s)

[cool and the theme file made it in where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m40s)

[I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m43s)

[expected uh LMN N N is there okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m45s)

[so let's fire the demo app see how it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m52s)

[goes then we will see if we have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h29m57s)

[numeric](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m00s)

[spinner](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m01s)

[numbers okay plus minus the numbers go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m04s)

[up and down just like we planned](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m09s)

[it okay that's that's that's horribly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m14s)

[exciting um okay so let's get here I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m18s)

[want to go back back and review the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m23s)

[comments that were on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m26s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m31s)

[see uh let's see this will not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m36s)

[Mark the event is handled if Delta is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m40s)

[zero uh Nikolai that is a wonderful](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m45s)

[comment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m49s)

[yeah that would be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h30m58s)

[annoying acid rain how you doing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m01s)

[buddy we are attempting to get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m05s)

[the the numeric up down control working](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m10s)

[I think Nikolai is correct that this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m13s)

[bad and that on Mouse](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m16s)

[wheel uh we want to set handled to true](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m22s)

[in all cases not just when Delta is non](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m25s)

[non zero I do wonder if it's actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m30s)

[possible to get this event to trigger](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m33s)

[where Delta is equal to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m35s)

[zero because that would mean that you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m39s)

[moved your mouse wheel a Delta of zero](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m42s)

[but if your Delta is zero how did your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m46s)

[mouse wheel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m48s)

[move I kind of wonder if zero is even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m49s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m52s)

[but regardless setting it to handle true](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m53s)

[in all cases I think is the appropriate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m56s)

[thing okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h31m58s)

[uh right and then the command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m04s)

[problem yes the command should be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m09s)

[changing it yes that was I think Kevin](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m12s)

[wrote this while he was lacking Mountain](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m14s)

[Dew um which](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m18s)

[is yeah I I think I was having a brain](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m22s)

[fart](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m26s)

[okay okay so minimum maximum increase](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m30s)

[command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m33s)

[property yeah decrease command property](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m36s)

[yeah so this is this this was this was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m39s)

[me just being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m41s)

[dumb uh and we should be consistent here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m47s)

[I kind of like null over default of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m51s)

[interface I think it's a little more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m53s)

[explicit](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m57s)

[um okay and so the the idea here is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h32m59s)

[there are multiple types of commands](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m04s)

[inside of WPF I command is the base](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m06s)

[interface for all of them the and I talk](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m09s)

[about this in some of my mvvm videos the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m12s)

[the big issue is I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m15s)

[command when they made WPF they didn't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m17s)

[provide an implementation of I command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m20s)

[that's expected to be used in your view](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m22s)

[models dumb my opinion like that feels](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m25s)

[like a very basic thing that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m28s)

[should however what they did do is they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m30s)

[provided implementation of I command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m33s)

[that is expected to be used for controls](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m35s)

[helpful in our case because we are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m38s)

[building a control so if we go something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m40s)

[like dialog host I think is probably a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m42s)

[better situ right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m44s)

[so rather than having like my brain](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m46s)

[immediately made the made me think that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m50s)

[this was a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m52s)

[a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m57s)

[um that this was a a view model type](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h33m58s)

[situation and I was like oh of course I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m02s)

[set it up like this but if you look at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m04s)

[the way like the commands are set up in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m07s)

[dialogue Host this is what uh Nikolai is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m09s)

[driving at which is the more better way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m13s)

[if you're building a control is you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m16s)

[don't expose up a dependency property](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m18s)

[like this what you do is you expose up a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m20s)

[router red command and then more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m23s)

[importantly if we look at the usages of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m25s)

[these guys you set up a routed command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m27s)

[Handler via](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m31s)

[this uh let's see doing very well thank](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m35s)

[you set out to recreate a instant](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m37s)

[messenger front and back end from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m40s)

[scratch using](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m41s)

[C++ but building blue SBS were causing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m43s)

[problems lots of header issues in C no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m46s)

[more C++ for me that is awesome so when](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m49s)

[you say AOL Instant Messenger do you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m54s)

[mean the actual AOL Instant Messenger or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m56s)

[are you just talking like a messenger](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h34m58s)

[clone and welcome](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m00s)

[Apollo um but yes so the idea here is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m03s)

[you have the routed commands and a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m06s)

[routed command doesn't do anything by](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m08s)

[default but once you have a command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m10s)

[binding that wires it up to something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m13s)

[now it can do something right so this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m15s)

[the this is the proper way to do it so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m18s)

[this is this is the other thing that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m21s)

[ncai very accurately pointed out of and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m23s)

[he said it nicely he didn't go with the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m26s)

[Kevin y [ __ ] approach which would have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m28s)

[been accurate but uh this is this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m31s)

[what we want to actually do we're going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m34s)

[to come over here and I think I'm going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m37s)

[to bring these guys up here I generally](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m39s)

[like I I like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m41s)

[grouping uh let's see we're going to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m43s)

[here and we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m48s)

[do the we're going to get rid of this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m50s)

[doc because it's wrong and then we're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m53s)

[going to copy paste that sucker and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m55s)

[decrease command is going to be here and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h35m59s)

[then you'll note on dialogue host we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m02s)

[don't register for or I should say the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m05s)

[the registration for the Handler occurs](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m08s)

[in the instance instructor not static](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m10s)

[exist back then so I'm cheating slightly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m32s)

[I think that's very appropriate I will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m35s)

[say way back in the day like AOL Instant](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h36m37s)

[some people don't even know what that is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h37m28s)

[and yes the old open source messenger](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h37m30s)

[this this was my happy place](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h37m33s)

[predictable and pigeon had this nice](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h38m27s)

[auto reply functionality and so I would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h38m30s)

[set up as many auto reply because you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h38m33s)

[from people where they'll say oh you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h40m51s)

[in order to get a job and blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h40m54s)

[that's a bunch of bull um however I will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h40m56s)

[point out a couple things I am biased um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m00s)

[I live in Washington State uh United](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m02s)

[States there is it like in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m05s)

[Washington or not Washington state in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m07s)

[the United States when we look at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m09s)

[demographics of programming languages](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m11s)

[the closer you get to like Seattle](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m14s)

[Redmond in Washington state where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m17s)

[Microsoft is headquartered shockingly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m18s)

[the more c.net jobs there are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m21s)

[right the the Microsoft poll is strong](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m24s)

[so there is whereas if you head down to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m27s)

[like Silicon Valley in uh California you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m30s)

[start to see a little bit more of the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m34s)

[well the newer hipper languages you get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m38s)

[a lot of java and that kind of stuff and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m40s)

[so the landscape of what jobs and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m42s)

[Technologies go together varies based on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m45s)

[location so just just keep that in mind](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m48s)

[so some areas people will go oh yeah you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m51s)

[know you if you know C you're good here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m53s)

[or oh no don't learn C no one does c](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m55s)

[around here that can be true depending](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h41m58s)

[on where you're located like there is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m00s)

[these weird geographical](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m01s)

[regions um of where certain things tend](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m03s)

[to be more popular if you're a student](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m07s)

[and willing to relocate the the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m09s)

[world is your oyster okay so a couple](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m13s)

[things first Shameless](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m15s)

[self-promotion um if you are looking for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m19s)

[a resource for learning SE](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m21s)

[language uh this is a the essential c](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m23s)

[book](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m27s)

[series um uh spoiler alert I hey look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m28s)

[there's my name um I am the technical](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m33s)

[editor for this and if you want a print](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m35s)

[copy you can go and buy one on Amazon um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m39s)

[but the contents of this website are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m42s)

[generated from the exact same contents](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m46s)

[that were used to print this book](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m48s)

[so and the website gets updates whereas](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m50s)

[it's really hard for us to put out a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m54s)

[patch release to a printed book so do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h42m55s)

[have this box oh cool that's that's even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m01s)

[better um yeah so but again it's this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m04s)

[focused only on the language not on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m07s)

[framework so aspet Blazer like there's a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m10s)

[blurry line between what's language and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m13s)

[what's framework um at certain times but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m15s)

[we try to keep it focused on language so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m19s)

[that it's more applicable applicable to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m21s)

[people okay um next up go find](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m23s)

[the so I work for a company called](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m29s)

[intellitech so us](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m35s)

[um and so we are a Professional Services](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m40s)

[Company uh which is a fancy way of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m43s)

[saying consulting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m45s)

[firm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m47s)

[the and we do hiring a little different](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m48s)

[than a lot of people people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m52s)

[so depending on where you are located](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m54s)

[you will find a lot of very common tips](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m56s)

[around getting software engineering jobs](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h43m59s)

[there's there's plenty of videos where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m02s)

[people will show you how to go through](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m03s)

[and prep for common uh programming](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m05s)

[interview](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m08s)

[questions um those aren't bad but I the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m09s)

[I would say what's better to do first is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m14s)

[when you're applying for a job look into](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m17s)

[the company that you're applying for and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m19s)

[see what you can find out about the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m21s)

[company and how they do their hiring or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m22s)

[similar that that can go a long way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m25s)

[because you can spend all this time](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m27s)

[prepping for like them to ask you how to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m29s)

[sort a list and then they'll never ask](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m32s)

[you that question in an interview and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m35s)

[you've just wasted all that time so the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m37s)

[more you can kind of prep going into it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m39s)

[it'll be very unlikely that companies](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m41s)

[will straight up tell you oh by the way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m43s)

[we asked the following questions in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m46s)

[interviews that's probably not going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m48s)

[happen they they usually don't do that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m50s)

[because they want like the whole point](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m52s)

[of an interview is to to gauge what a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m53s)

[candidate knows and so you don't want to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m55s)

[you don't want to poison the waters too](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h44m59s)

[much do they ask that these days not so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m01s)

[what I have seen companies do um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m05s)

[slightly more often is they will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m07s)

[ask um for either samples of your code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m10s)

[or they will do like take-home um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m14s)

[programming uh things and so we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m18s)

[uh at intellitech we prefer if somebody](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m23s)

[uh turns in a resume we we love it when](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m27s)

[their resume contains like um a GitHub](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m30s)

[profile or repos or any sample of your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m33s)

[work expect that the interviewer wants](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m36s)

[to know what you know and what you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m39s)

[do so any samples you can provide that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m41s)

[doesn't care if it's a hobby project](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m44s)

[something that you did in school](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m46s)

[something that you did as part of an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m48s)

[internship obviously if it's closed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m49s)

[Source not supposed to sh don't don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m51s)

[post private stuff online obviously](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m54s)

[don't do that that's bad that will not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m55s)

[get you a job that will make people not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m57s)

[want to hire you um but anything that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h45m58s)

[you anything that you have that you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m01s)

[able to show is awesome right show it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m03s)

[off people always get weirded out going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m06s)

[oh well this was just a hobby project y](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m08s)

[y y show it right uh even somebody who](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m10s)

[did something as long as you can talk](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m14s)

[about it right and it's actually okay if](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m16s)

[your code isn't perfect right if you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m21s)

[look at it and have a conversation go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m23s)

[yeah you know hey this was a hobby](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m25s)

[project no I didn't bother to write a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m27s)

[lot of unit tests because I was just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m28s)

[trying to get something to work right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m30s)

[that's fine like I'm very okay if a a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m32s)

[candidate says something like that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m34s)

[because it shows that they are able to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m36s)

[look at their code and evaluate it like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m38s)

[that's one of the hardest skills to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m40s)

[teach people is read the code and then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m42s)

[evaluate you know two different options](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m45s)

[which one is better like when I teach at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m47s)

[the University that was one of my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m49s)

[favorite things to ask students is you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m51s)

[know here's two here's two methods that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m54s)

[do the same thing which one's better and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m56s)

[why right that's a hard skill to teach](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h46m58s)

[because if you've got two methods that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m01s)

[do the same thing which one's better](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m02s)

[that's that's now gone from objective to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m05s)

[subjective and it sometimes you can look](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m07s)

[it goes well yeah that one has a bug or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m10s)

[that one's horribly difficult to read or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m12s)

[similar like but sometimes that's not an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m14s)

[easy thing to do so being able to have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m17s)

[some code and talk through it will go a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m19s)

[long way so if you have anything like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m21s)

[that on your that you can put onto your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m24s)

[resume uh uh do that uh opinions on code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m27s)

[comments um my current opinion on code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m32s)

[comments is comment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m37s)

[anything comment the why don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m41s)

[necessarily comment the what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m44s)

[because if I and and I'm I'm going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m47s)

[put a small Aster next to that sometimes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m51s)

[commenting what code is doing is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m53s)

[important if the method is somewhat](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m55s)

[complicated right if you had to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h47m58s)

[implement some some weirdo algorithm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m00s)

[that that isn't immediate like if if I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m03s)

[look at the code and it takes me more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m06s)

[than two seconds to understand what it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m07s)

[doing by all means put a comment on it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m09s)

[explain explain the what it's doing is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m12s)

[fine most of the time though the what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m14s)

[it's doing is pretty obvious for example](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m16s)

[I'm not going to put a comment and say](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m19s)

[this is a command increases the value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m21s)

[because that should be bloody obvious](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m24s)

[from the name um yeah the the what is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m25s)

[hopefully self-describing not always](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m28s)

[most of the time it should be but the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m31s)

[but the why is something that's you like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m35s)

[the what is usually captured in code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m37s)

[that's easy the why is never captured in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m40s)

[code and so that's what usually is where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m43s)

[a comment is very useful of we are doing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m45s)

[this because because that information](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m48s)

[doesn't exist there and so um yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m51s)

[comments can lie and that is the thing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m55s)

[is the biggest problem is when you add a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h48m56s)

[comment keeping it in sync with the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m00s)

[that it's commenting is a nightmare](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m02s)

[right we talk about dry like do not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m04s)

[repeat yourself and then we repeat](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m07s)

[ourselves in the code and then in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m08s)

[comment right next to it it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m09s)

[like right but dry is a guideline not a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m11s)

[hard fast rule right sometimes it is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m15s)

[better to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m18s)

[duplicate it kind of going back and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m19s)

[forth](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m22s)

[uh let's see projects are definitely on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m23s)

[my list really want to make desktop apps](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m25s)

[with avalonia oh you are speaking to my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m27s)

[heart I love it but the web seems to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m28s)

[easier to Showcase especially to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m30s)

[employers but wanting to make a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m32s)

[documentation platform like Hugo Gatsby](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m34s)

[Etc I think might be good enough but I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m36s)

[don't know if I should do typical apis](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m39s)

[like weather app Etc too yeah I I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m42s)

[know if what you build matters as much](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m45s)

[as being able to have it and show you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m47s)

[are correct having a webbased thing is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m50s)

[is certainly nice because it shows it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m53s)

[easier to to like link from you know uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h49m56s)

[an online profile or similar and show up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m00s)

[it also shows that you can deploy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m02s)

[something um but even then if somebody](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m04s)

[comes to me like I I interviewed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m08s)

[somebody who built like a uh a Unity](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m10s)

[plugin right that's not something that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m13s)

[easy to demo because you have to have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m16s)

[unity set up you then have to get the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m18s)

[plug-in put into it right and so it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m20s)

[wasn't something something that was easy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m22s)

[to demo and it wasn't necessarily about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m23s)

[running the app but we were able to open](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m25s)

[up the repository and kind of talk](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m27s)

[through the areas of the code and at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m29s)

[least when we interview off that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m31s)

[that's really what I'm looking to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m34s)

[with somebody is I want to know how much](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m35s)

[they understand the code and ideally if](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m37s)

[you built the project you should be the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m40s)

[foremost expert on it so you should be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m42s)

[able to explain to me and kind of walk](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m45s)

[through and say okay here's some code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m47s)

[here's what it's doing and then usually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m50s)

[I like to start poking at it a little](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m52s)

[bit and start asking questions okay why](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m53s)

[this why did you make that decision](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m56s)

[right and kind of trying to trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h50m58s)

[tease out how much the person](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m00s)

[understands about the code that they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m02s)

[wrote because some people they can get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m03s)

[something working simply because they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m05s)

[they copied and pasted off a stack](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m08s)

[Overflow so I like to ask those](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m09s)

[questions because it it really teases](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m12s)

[out did you like I don't mind if](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m15s)

[somebody copies their entire program](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m17s)

[from stack Overflow by the way as long](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m18s)

[as you can explain to me what the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m20s)

[does does totally fine with the copy and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m22s)

[paste right as long as you understand it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m24s)

[great right you don't understand it it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m27s)

[probably when you shouldn't be copying](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m30s)

[and pasting um okay what uh other](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m31s)

[resource as well so this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m35s)

[is this is one and and I I I will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m38s)

[preface this this is somewhat similar to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m41s)

[or or somewhat specific to in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m44s)

[tetch](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m47s)

[uh oh Izzy sorry I just saw your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m49s)

[question about UK branch no um sadly we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m52s)

[don't have a branch outside of Spokan we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m55s)

[have some a handful of remote people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h51m57s)

[but they we've we've teased the idea of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m00s)

[starting remote ones and never had](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m03s)

[enough or people to do so um but this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m06s)

[one here is a bunch of application tips](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m10s)

[and tricks right so I think at the time](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m13s)

[of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m16s)

[recording um Grant here on the right uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m16s)

[was the CTO um and Stephanie uh I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m20s)

[her title was office manager or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m24s)

[similar um but at least when we do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m26s)

[interviews there's a lot of stuff that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m30s)

[we're looking for there's uh what do you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m31s)

[know how well do you learn and then a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m34s)

[lot of like um attitude teamwork level](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m37s)

[stuff right those are kind of the big](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m40s)

[areas that that we try to focus in on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m42s)

[and you'll note that what you know is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m45s)

[only one of three right and uh we'll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m47s)

[often say that we want a can to have at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m51s)

[Le ideally if a candidate can have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m53s)

[everything that' be perfect but those](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m54s)

[people don't exist um everybody's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m56s)

[stronger in some areas than than others](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h52m59s)

[and so we're usually looking to say okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m01s)

[do you do you have at least two out of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m03s)

[three things and then and then we try to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m04s)

[say okay does that fit into the role](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m06s)

[that we're looking for if you're coming](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m08s)

[in as a student we are probably caring](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m10s)

[less about how much you know because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m12s)

[somebody who just graduate we don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m15s)

[expect you to know a lot we want to make](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m17s)

[sure that the student has a firm grasp](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m19s)

[on foundations](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m21s)

[so things like um objectoriented related](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m23s)

[stuff uh being able to reason through](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m27s)

[algorithms um is often times a big thing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m29s)

[there and even some programming problems](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m32s)

[are just thinking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m34s)

[through uh problems and being able to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m36s)

[solve them we love it when we can see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m39s)

[people who have a firm grph on Source](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m41s)

[control specifically git um because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m44s)

[that's like what everything uses not a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m47s)

[lot of students graduate from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m49s)

[universities that teach s control when](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m51s)

[we teach we absolutely Force our](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m53s)

[students to learn it but some people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m55s)

[come from other universities and they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m57s)

[they're like What's GitHub it's like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h53m59s)

[right okay we've got we've got some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m01s)

[teaching to do here so um a firm Gras on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m03s)

[on that will go a long way because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m08s)

[pretty much I would say 98 99% of jobs](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m11s)

[out there are probably going to be uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m15s)

[making you use Source control and a huge](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m18s)

[percentage of that is going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m21s)

[get so it's the best one to learn](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m22s)

[because it has a sweepingly large market](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m27s)

[share of all of the jobs I think of all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m30s)

[of the places I have worked and all the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m33s)

[clients I've worked with over the last](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m35s)

[10 years I think only one didn't use git](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m37s)

[there's probably like 30 or 40 different](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m42s)

[companies in that list so there's there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m45s)

[there is a lot there's a lot out there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m49s)

[and if you find a job offer from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m51s)

[somebody who isn't using Source control](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m54s)

[turn and run turn and run you just don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m56s)

[know like don't don't even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h54m59s)

[uhu do I need a do I need to scrub that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h55m06s)

[or is that is is that just an accidental](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h55m09s)

[going into that the other thing that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h55m35s)

[often goes a long way especially for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h55m38s)

[follow up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h55m44s)

[stuff shared in here about getting an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h56m57s)

[internship applies to Landing an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h56m59s)

[entry-level job as well because an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m03s)

[internship in a lot of cases is an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m05s)

[extended interview for a full-time offer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m07s)

[a lot of companies bring in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m10s)

[interns and usually by the time the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m12s)

[internship runs out the company is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m14s)

[really clear about whether this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m16s)

[somebody that they would hire or not now](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m18s)

[they may not be able to hire them right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m19s)

[like we bring in I think I think in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m22s)

[telch has something like six or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m24s)

[eight um interns this year and we like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m26s)

[hopefully at the end of the year if at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m32s)

[least the ones that are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m34s)

[graduating um if they've done well there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m36s)

[there's potentially a job offer on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m39s)

[line now a lot of things go into that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m41s)

[you know do we actually have a project](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m43s)

[we can put them on etc etc so the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m45s)

[sometimes if you don't get hired after](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m48s)

[your internship it's not necessarily](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m49s)

[that you did a poor job or or anything](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m50s)

[it's just that the company's not in a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m52s)

[place to hire you so it it it goes about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m53s)

[both ways but an internship in a lot of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m56s)

[cases is a an extended interview uh is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h57m58s)

[LinkedIn](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m02s)

[important uh I would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m03s)

[say I would say an online presence is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m06s)

[important a LinkedIn is definitely a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m09s)

[good way to go um I wouldn't say](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m11s)

[required but it definitely a good thing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m14s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m17s)

[do so um you want to public online](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m18s)

[presence but like i' I've seen people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m23s)

[come in like not having anything is bad](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m26s)

[right you should have you should have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m29s)

[something whether that be uh a LinkedIn](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m31s)

[whether that should be a you you know an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m33s)

[online resume and like uh a GitHub page](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m36s)

[or or similar like you you need to have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m40s)

[some sort of online presence it's very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m43s)

[hard to interview candidates that come](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m46s)

[to us without much a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m50s)

[show like if they come and they they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m53s)

[don't have um they they don't have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m55s)

[GitHub they don't have a LinkedIn they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h58m58s)

[don't have any code samples it gets](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m00s)

[really hard to kind of have that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m02s)

[conversation because you're you're kind](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m03s)

[of interviewing blind um let's see what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m04s)

[about messaging Recruiters on LinkedIn](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m08s)

[from companies you're interested in uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m10s)

[asking about what the company uses or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m12s)

[what the interview processes are like uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m14s)

[yeah so that can certainly work I you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m17s)

[could actually go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m20s)

[even one step further](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m22s)

[um uh okay Izzy does point out if so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m25s)

[public sector they can be very unhappy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m30s)

[if you have certain online profiles I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m32s)

[think I think it does depend what kind](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m36s)

[of profile you have though because I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m38s)

[work with a bunch of Microsoft MVPs who](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m40s)

[very much have very strong public](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m43s)

[profiles because that's what they do um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m46s)

[but it it depends on like what is there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m49s)

[right right like if you're if you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m51s)

[using something like a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m54s)

[LinkedIn don't Lo use it don't use](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m56s)

[LinkedIn like a social media site like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=01h59m58s)

[use it like an online resume though](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m01s)

[those should be kept very different as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m04s)

[far as how they get used](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m07s)

[um yeah um I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m11s)

[necessarily matters when you start right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m14s)

[and again for people who are hiring](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m17s)

[entry](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m19s)

[level uh people like fresh out of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m20s)

[school there's not an expectation that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m24s)

[you know everything there like the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m26s)

[expectation is very clear you just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m29s)

[graduated so the question is are you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m31s)

[like so if if somebody's calling you in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m35s)

[for an interview after looking at your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m37s)

[resume they know that you're a fresh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m38s)

[graduate they know that you don't have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m40s)

[lot of hands-on experience maybe some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m42s)

[like senior projects maybe some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m45s)

[internships if you've done any like um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m47s)

[hobby project s definitely put that on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m51s)

[there like hobby projects go a long way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m53s)

[because it shows not only what you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h00m57s)

[do but it also shows a willingness to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m00s)

[learn and invest time in a craft outside](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m02s)

[of what you were required to do for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m05s)

[school so even if you don't think your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m07s)

[hobby project is that good or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m10s)

[interesting like it shows some stuff](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m12s)

[yeah and GitHub open source PRS are good](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m16s)

[as well the only thing that's hard is is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m18s)

[finding a way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m21s)

[to to to like list them and show them](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m22s)

[right like if you have a GitHub profile](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m26s)

[and you specifically call out in your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m29s)

[resume hey I contribute to this other um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m31s)

[like I contribute to this other open](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m35s)

[source project I may go and look that up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m36s)

[but understand that when people are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m39s)

[looking at your resume they aren't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m41s)

[likely to dive more than maybe one or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m43s)

[two levels deep on anything you give](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m46s)

[them like some people might go deeper](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m48s)

[but a lot of times like if you've got a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m50s)

[link to your GitHub profile I might hit](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m52s)

[your profile and I might go one level](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m55s)

[deeper and and that's and that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h01m57s)

[probably as far as I go right like uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m00s)

[Nikolai great timing I got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m03s)

[your PRS merged and then I got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m06s)

[sidetracked because somebody started](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m08s)

[asking questions about getting jobs](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m10s)

[which if you've got if you've got advice](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m12s)

[for we'll call them fresh graduates out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m15s)

[of University getting their first job uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m18s)

[feel free to drop it in Nikolai is one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m21s)

[of the other maintainers on the material](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m24s)

[design project](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m26s)

[so one could call him an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m28s)

[expert](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m31s)

[um yeah sorry I forgot where sorry I got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m33s)

[to scroll back up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m36s)

[uh yeah so the other thing that that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m38s)

[does sometimes work and this will vary](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m41s)

[from company to company one a referral](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m43s)

[goes a long way uh like massively Long](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m46s)

[Way um there's a there's a a running](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m50s)

[joke at least around here that it's not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m52s)

[what you know it's who you know um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m55s)

[because if you have a referral on your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h02m58s)

[resume you are significantly more likely](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m01s)

[to get an interview you are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m05s)

[significantly more likely to get a call](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m06s)

[back the a referral from somebody you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m09s)

[don't really know will probably help a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m12s)

[little bit a referral from somebody who](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m15s)

[actually knows you goes a lot further](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m17s)

[right so the the more the more Rapport](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m20s)

[you build with somebody the the more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m23s)

[likely their referral is going to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m25s)

[because occasionally I get people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m27s)

[reaching out to me on LinkedIn saying](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m28s)

[and like I I'll give them my assessment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m50s)

[but it's like that that's as much as I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m52s)

[can recommend somebody who I don't like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m54s)

[actually know if it's somebody who who's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h03m56s)

[for learning no credit and that's that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m10s)

[the thing is if if you don't need](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m12s)

[official credit it doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m13s)

[because we've occasionally done this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m16s)

[with like some of our interns as well is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m18s)

[university doesn't have to like fill out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m39s)

[an official transcript and do all the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m41s)

[paperwork and whatnot they don't care](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m43s)

[that much like as far as they're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m45s)

[concerned they're like if the instructor](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m48s)

[wants to take off more work of having](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h12m50s)

[like Adjunct professor pay is barely](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h13m02s)

[that between like two or three](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h13m08s)

[instructors and so you take almost](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h13m10s)

[nothing and then you divide it by three](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h13m12s)

[and that that's how much we make so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h13m15s)

[look at more before I potentially punted](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m36s)

[it I don't think it's a big issue to fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m39s)

[for 51 but I wanted to make sure it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m41s)

[wasn't already done before I just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m44s)

[blindly punted it accessibility issue I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m46s)

[haven't even touched yet uh uh just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m48s)

[finished the third coffee walking in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m51s)

[door of the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m53s)

[for excellent see that sounds like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m55s)

[you're finally pre dizzy you you finally](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h16m58s)

[woken up in the morning um the tree view](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m00s)

[one is a simple addition I was tempted](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m02s)

[to just go through and make it make it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m05s)

[go away um I looked at the the scroll](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m07s)

[viewer ignore padding one and I punted](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m11s)

[that PR to the next](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m13s)

[release um only on the reason that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m15s)

[the be this old Behavior matches default](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m21s)

[WPF controls like and so as much as I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m24s)

[want to like the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m29s)

[solution it it concerns me that we would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m31s)

[be adding something that would change](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m34s)

[the behavior of scroll viewer for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m36s)

[somebody bringing a regular WPF](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m38s)

[application forward so I yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m40s)

[I I got Twitchy on it I'm like so there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m43s)

[was some decent suggestions on where' it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m46s)

[Go of maybe maybe splitting this out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m49s)

[yeah yeah and I think not reusing the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m53s)

[same padding property probably is better](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m56s)

[right like I get the desire normally](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h17m59s)

[this gets solved by just put a margin on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m01s)

[your content but that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m04s)

[generically so it's like I like I get it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m07s)

[if you want it generic you kind of have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m10s)

[to do something here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m12s)

[but so yeah yeah so that's kind of where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m15s)

[it's at I this one here I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m19s)

[know why did I not merge](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m23s)

[this trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m26s)

[remember um all right we got oh I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m31s)

[remember dang now I remember this one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m35s)

[this is the one on the dialogue host](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m37s)

[because we had that discussion on it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m40s)

[okay I remember this now and we ran into](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m42s)

[the problem of trying to figure out how](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m45s)

[to actually write the test and we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m48s)

[couldn't query the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m51s)

[items yeah I added update the top of the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m52s)

[description](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h18m56s)

[yeah uh that a card style but several](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m00s)

[properties will be ignored because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m03s)

[they're past to hardcoded oh yes yes yes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m05s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m07s)

[yes yeah it feels like there's no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m09s)

[winning on this one like no matter what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m12s)

[we do one of the two cases is going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m15s)

[be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m17s)

[wrong which makes me wonder if the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m19s)

[approach is missing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m22s)

[something because we either have to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m28s)

[forward everything](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m31s)

[down yeah punt it okay given that you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m34s)

[the author of it I'm not going to argue](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m39s)

[with you 52 it is uh we need to find a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m41s)

[cleaner approach yeah there it feels](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m44s)

[something yeah I don't know the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m47s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m49s)

[I don't know the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m51s)

[solution which is really it's kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m54s)

[frustrating that the card being an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m56s)

[internal implementation detail requires](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h19m59s)

[so much](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m02s)

[configuration I'm like when I took over](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m06s)

[this library at the beginning um one of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m10s)

[the things the author told me was that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m12s)

[dialog host was one of his most](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m14s)

[problematic controls because it got used](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m16s)

[wrong in so many ways and there was so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m20s)

[many issues around it he's like it might](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m22s)

[need a complete rework and I I've I've](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m27s)

[actually contemplated that over the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m29s)

[years of if I were to rebuild dialogues](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m31s)

[from scratch what would I do right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m34s)

[because ma app solves it in a different](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m37s)

[way where they basically make you derive](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m39s)

[from their window class so that they can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m41s)

[do the rapper over it which I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m43s)

[fully](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m46s)

[like like it does solve some of the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m47s)

[problem problems in a very clean way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m50s)

[because then your users don't think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m52s)

[about it it just goes away it works](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m54s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m56s)

[but the dialog host as we have it gives](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h20m58s)

[us you know you can over overlap it on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m01s)

[you know smaller sections and similar](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m04s)

[it's like that's kind of nice but then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m06s)

[people also ask for hey can you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m09s)

[implement messagebox Dosh show for me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m11s)

[it's like not really but we could try](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m13s)

[like there's not a good way for us to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m17s)

[just inject and go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m19s)

[so yeah I I've spent a lot of time](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m22s)

[thinking about halfway points and you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m25s)

[know custom window chromes and well](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m28s)

[maybe we should roll our own window](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m30s)

[class or similar just so that there's an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m32s)

[easier way to do it like that would be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m35s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m37s)

[nice maybe so yeah so I was going to get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m38s)

[the um your comments on the numeric](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m44s)

[stuff up on the up down control at least](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m48s)

[in and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m51s)

[then work backwards from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m53s)

[there I think that's that's basically](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m55s)

[where we're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h21m59s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h22m01s)

[going okay and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h22m04s)

[then let's see here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h22m09s)

[so yeah does that mean](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h22m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h22m21s)

[that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m27s)

[okay uh hold on I already did fix this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m29s)

[didn't I the old value is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m32s)

[true oh yeah there we are there we are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m39s)

[okay old value is true I can read](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m42s)

[somewhat uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m45s)

[yeah uh they should really probably be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h23m55s)

[uh why are you just being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m26s)

[dumb why am I being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m29s)

[dumb really a 50/50](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m33s)

[uh where does this go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m40s)

[spider oh that's why I was exped to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m46s)

[in my code see this is this is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m49s)

[where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m52s)

[yeah yeah and I don't even think we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h24m58s)

[necessarily do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m00s)

[the the setup here quite like this might](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m04s)

[even be better](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m07s)

[but I don't I don't know if I want to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m11s)

[down the whole gesture approach versus](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m13s)

[just the the code behind Handler because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m15s)

[they had to wire up their own input](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m17s)

[gesture and all of that Stu stuff which](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m19s)

[is fine but yes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m21s)

[um what I'm missing though is where does](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m25s)

[the parameter go on a routed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m29s)

[command also I'm very happy to see this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m33s)

[uh I think it's the comment in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m36s)

[numeric down](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m40s)

[file uh let's see Apollo kind of random](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m44s)

[how often do you stream no great](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m47s)

[question Apollo so so I am in Pacific](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m49s)

[time so West Coast United States so uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m52s)

[times are going to be reported in that I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m56s)

[I do not report my times in UTC uh so I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h25m58s)

[stream Wednesday evenings starting at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m02s)

[02:26:06,760 --> 02:26:12,279](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m05s)

p.m. uh and usually go in the two to

[3ish hour](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m10s)

[range I I used to tell people I go for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m12s)

[two hours and I don't remember the last](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m15s)

[time I cut my stream off at two hours](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m17s)

[it's been a very long time so I have a I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m19s)

[have a a bad habit of going much later](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m22s)

[than](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m25s)

[that but yeah so just due to family kids](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m26s)

[all of that 900 p.m. is the earliest I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m32s)

[can reasonably get on and so it is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m34s)

[horrible time slot for the vast majority](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m37s)

[of my target audience which is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m40s)

[English-speaking uh. net developers and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m42s)

[unfortunately when you start your stream](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m45s)

[at 9900 p.m West Coast United States](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m47s)

[most people tend to be asleep or up late](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m50s)

[crazy like me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m54s)

[so it it's funny I look at the analytics](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m56s)

[and often times somewhere like I pick up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h26m59s)

[morning in Europe uh for Thursday](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m02s)

[morning for a lot of people as things](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m04s)

[come across it's just after lunch in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m06s)

[Japan yeah so Andrew has a a reasonable](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m08s)

[time slot for some people or or Pikachu](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m11s)

[but yeah for for a lot of it like I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m14s)

[targeting people that are across an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m17s)

[ocean from me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m19s)

[rather than anybody nearby which is kind](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m20s)

[of funny um but I do the The Links at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m23s)

[the bottom down below I do post the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m27s)

[recordings up on YouTube which I tend to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m29s)

[get a lot more um us views on YouTube](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m31s)

[rather than twitch because then people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m35s)

[can watch it in an hour that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m37s)

[convenient yeah see or or acid rain who](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m41s)

[just you know is a complete Night Owl as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m44s)

[far as I can tell um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m48s)

[oh yeah 230 but my sleep schedule get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m55s)

[unpredictable around midterms yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h27m59s)

[yeah um I I completely understand](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m03s)

[that uh let's see the command should be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m10s)

[used to actually change the value not be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m13s)

[execute when the value is changed blah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m15s)

[blah blah yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m16s)

[so inside of here what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m18s)

[then is a Constructor that actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m21s)

[wires up to the command](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m23s)

[bindings](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m28s)

[add right new command binding increase](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m30s)

[command blah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m34s)

[blah uh I think my point is you probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m38s)

[should not have the command at all I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m40s)

[would handle the click event in the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m41s)

[bu then possibly have a routed event](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m43s)

[notifying the value change oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m44s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m46s)

[because I was I was briefly considering](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m52s)

[them being similar to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m54s)

[the the open close dialogue commands](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h28m59s)

[ones but now you say that now I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m02s)

[wondering if you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m04s)

[right because the only thing I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m07s)

[thinking about though is on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m09s)

[the on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m12s)

[like from my usages](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m16s)

[would I ever need something know you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m20s)

[make a good point from an mvvm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m24s)

[perspective in my view model the only](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m26s)

[thing I ever really care about is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m29s)

[binding to the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m30s)

[value the fact that there is buttons](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m32s)

[that make the value go up and down is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m35s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m37s)

[circumstantial the only thing that I was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m43s)

[thinking of is I was imagining the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m46s)

[somebody wanting to change the parameter](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m49s)

[that goes in but at that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m52s)

[point I don't think that's the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m55s)

[okay yeah okay you just convinced](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h29m57s)

[me I think I just needed to hear myself](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m01s)

[say it out loud to realize I was an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m03s)

[idiot okay so that makes this whole](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m05s)

[thing significantly easier because then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m08s)

[I just do this and then the problem goes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m11s)

[away](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m14s)

[yeah that does because we're already](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m21s)

[handling](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m24s)

[the because we're already handling the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m26s)

[button clicks right so those things are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m28s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m31s)

[work right so that doesn't need to that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m31s)

[doesn't need to exist these don't need](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m34s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m37s)

[exist but this just got a whole lot](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m37s)

[simpler okay this must be the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m41s)

[solution it feels](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m43s)

[easier like that's that's often times a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m45s)

[when your code starts to feel easy to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m48s)

[use that's when you know you've started](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m50s)

[to hit a good](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m52s)

[spot sorry I I just saw your how else](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h30m57s)

[can you build your messenger app I will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m01s)

[say I I have built many a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m04s)

[thing late late at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m06s)

[night and and the real test is tomorrow](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m09s)

[morning if you look at the code and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m12s)

[you're still okay with it it was a good](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m15s)

[night cuz I will say there are a number](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m18s)

[of times where I've looked at stuff the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m20s)

[next day and gone what the heck was I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m22s)

[thinking last night Kevin was clearly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m25s)

[out of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m28s)

[it goes there that goes there that goes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m31s)

[there okay so if that's the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m34s)

[case yeah definitely days where I looked](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m38s)

[at the code and go uh what was I even](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m40s)

[trying to do here yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m42s)

[yeah that is very much how it goes okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m45s)

[now we run](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m50s)

[tests and make sure that I haven't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m52s)

[broken](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m54s)

[anything uh my test window is over on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m55s)

[the other monitor I would go move it but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h31m57s)

[these are UI tests that are going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m00s)

[start dragging the mouse around so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m02s)

[they're going to stay over there for the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m04s)

[moment and the flashy Windows that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m06s)

[that's the UI](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m09s)

[test good news](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m12s)

[though green](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m15s)

[circle we have passing test all three of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m17s)

[them and by three of them it only](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m21s)

[executed one of them because I clearly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m22s)

[clicked inside of it let's try this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m24s)

[again this time with all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m26s)

[three get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m33s)

[that now let's go look at the test I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m35s)

[trying to remember exactly what I did in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m38s)

[these tests let's see numeric uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m39s)

[increase and decrease](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m41s)

[value got it so it just wires that up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m46s)

[goes back and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m50s)

[forth](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m51s)

[okay let's see here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m53s)

[so uh do not know why I have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h32m56s)

[that okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m00s)

[so uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m03s)

[removed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m06s)

[comms see here what else we got this was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m07s)

[just moving the test file into the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m11s)

[appropriate Place uh reverted uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m13s)

[attach uh the bugger change in base UI](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m21s)

[test class put my head on the other side](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m27s)

[that way I'm not covering up what I am](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m30s)

[doing in here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m32s)

[okay get cracken commit get cracken](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m35s)

[push and full](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m38s)

[send here America up down let's see it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m47s)

[IDE I think the minimum maximums are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m50s)

[missing some coercion check callbacks to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m52s)

[ensure a valid range oh that's a good](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m54s)

[point that is a very good point](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h33m57s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m00s)

[so yeah because right now they have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m03s)

[nothing so that would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m05s)

[be so I guess then the question is what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m15s)

[if the maximum changes after to a value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m20s)

[lower than the current value the value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m23s)

[should move down to be equal to the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m26s)

[maximum I think these warrant some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m31s)

[tests uh I believe slider has minimum as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m34s)

[the main](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m37s)

[driver](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m40s)

[yeah that would make](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m43s)

[sense and I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m45s)

[I close it no um see where is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m49s)

[there one of these things here shows me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h34m55s)

[the let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m00s)

[see are you not in alphabetical order oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m08s)

[because you are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m11s)

[on let's see coer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m13s)

[value oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m17s)

[yeah let's see what it does here let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m22s)

[see on maximum](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m25s)

[change it coerces the start and end](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m27s)

[property so I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m32s)

[the on minimum change Coes the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m36s)

[start got it so it's basically just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m43s)

[shelling out to whatever the coer method](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m47s)

[is is on start and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m49s)

[end uh let's see so core](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m51s)

[start and then it just does something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m55s)

[like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m57s)

[that I assume Co end is not too unlike](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h35m59s)

[that yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m02s)

[it's same exact thing but I think you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m04s)

[right I think we need something like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m07s)

[coer value and then min max need](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m09s)

[to need to control it so I think I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m14s)

[there's actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m17s)

[uh well hold on I'm going to write a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m19s)

[test first and then then we'll go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m21s)

[through and change it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m23s)

[uh JC quick callback question to a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m25s)

[couple months ago how can I bind is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m28s)

[mouse over property of the internal text](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m31s)

[fi assist to call commit edit on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m34s)

[data](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m38s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m40s)

[oo so let's see is mouse over](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m43s)

[property let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m47s)

[is that is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m50s)

[the build](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m52s)

[assist uh let's see where is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h36m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m05s)

[I is there a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m11s)

[mouse um oh I'm at the wrong oh you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m16s)

[right thank](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m20s)

[you because we we hid those ones in here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m22s)

[yeah internal name space got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m27s)

[it let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m31s)

[see uh let's see find the is mouse over](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m33s)

[property to call commit edit on my data](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m37s)

[grid let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m44s)

[uh Izzy have a good day don't enjoy work](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m52s)

[too](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m55s)

[much um that is a good](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h37m59s)

[question easiest way to go about doing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m05s)

[that because it's set up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m11s)

[as you have the attached property but in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m15s)

[order to call commit edit you have to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m18s)

[inside the code behind because I assume](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m20s)

[you're inside the code behind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m23s)

[whatever element contains your data grid](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m25s)

[so you're able because the commit edit I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m29s)

[think lives on data grid itself or does](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m31s)

[it live on data grid cell either way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m34s)

[you're living](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m36s)

[there so when this guy changes you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m39s)

[going to end up wanting to go through](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m42s)

[and do that um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m44s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m53s)

[here because uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m54s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h38m58s)

[everything ah because you're wanting to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m02s)

[track that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m05s)

[guy oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m07s)

[but there might be an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m09s)

[alternate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m12s)

[so let me justun his usages out here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m15s)

[because this guy is going to be bound](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m19s)

[to the whole point of him is so that we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m28s)

[have a way of tracking](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m32s)

[them he is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m35s)

[Setter the only assignment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m42s)

[that's a read read read read](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m50s)

[read right time picker and date picker](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m53s)

[are the only two that actually apply it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m57s)

[and they're just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h39m59s)

[setting I guess I'm curious](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m02s)

[why you want this attached property](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m06s)

[JC this may not be what you this may not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m10s)

[be doing what you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m14s)

[need uh this is is because the cancel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m17s)

[button doesn't trigger keyboard got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m20s)

[Focus](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m30s)

[oh uh hang](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m36s)

[on I can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m42s)

[type can't do it people are looking so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m44s)

[in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m48s)

[of the text box so you actually but do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m51s)

[you have a one of the Picker controls](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m54s)

[inside of your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m56s)

[cell what am I saying you sent me a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h40m58s)

[link](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m02s)

[um go here side of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m06s)

[here be a data grid there's your stack](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m09s)

[panel oh because this is in the column](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m14s)

[header that's right wasn't actually down](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m17s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m20s)

[cell in your header you've actually X](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m22s)

[boox to build out like the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m25s)

[filtery](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m30s)

[right so this one is probably not going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m36s)

[to land because I like stack panels](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m39s)

[aren't going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m42s)

[have they're not going to get keyboard](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m45s)

[focused because because they aren't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m48s)

[focusable so I I don't expect this to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m51s)

[pick it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h41m54s)

[intent](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h46m13s)

[edit you want the filter to go away that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h47m05s)

[because right now when I when I move out](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h47m09s)

[doesn't match the filter anymore so is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h47m12s)

[uh have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m30s)

[access one of those areas where it gets](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m32s)

[a little obnoxious because this is a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m34s)

[leaky](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m36s)

[abstraction um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m37s)

[production exception doesn't Tri oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m50s)

[interest that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h51m56s)

[exciting I go here and then I go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m03s)

[here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m14s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m16s)

[I wonder if the exception is occurring](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m20s)

[JC but you just can't see it because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m24s)

[you'll note here if I delete this and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m28s)

[then I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m31s)

[click then I just ignore the exception](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m34s)

[and keep](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m36s)

[going I'm now is this the behavior that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m38s)

[you're seeing so let's launch this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m40s)

[without debugging I control F5 this guy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m43s)

[so I I'm willing to bet it's the same](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m47s)

[issue it's just with the debugger](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m49s)

[attached you see it without it you don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m50s)

[all right so if I go here or I go here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m53s)

[right and I come in here and I delete](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h52m58s)

[this right if I click](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m01s)

[this it looks like it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m04s)

[not um moving off but I think what's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m07s)

[actually happening is you're getting the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m11s)

[exception and WPF is just ignoring](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m13s)

[it Andor the it could be this guy is is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m16s)

[hiding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m20s)

[it possible it's either okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m24s)

[um we change this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m29s)

[up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m32s)

[right do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m34s)

[this do this right so stop](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m38s)

[there uh do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m42s)

[that close that if I come down here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m45s)

[um but now I have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h53m56s)

[access uh is editing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m01s)

[item prise like I hate to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m04s)

[a we could do a deferred call back do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m11s)

[that instead with like a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m15s)

[but it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m19s)

[seems](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m22s)

[wondering look at what's on this guy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m24s)

[before I get too carried away is there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m26s)

[a is really what you want to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m34s)

[is down here uh let's see notes F update](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m38s)

[tag](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m43s)

[status I think it was so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m45s)

[if this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m49s)

[right we want to do uh filter](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m51s)

[view](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h54m55s)

[uh right edit item what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m02s)

[I want to cancel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m05s)

[the uh let's see can I clear](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m10s)

[it well let me do it from the back side](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m14s)

[commit edit probably where we want to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m20s)

[and then try this I think this I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m23s)

[this might be easier to solve with the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m26s)

[going through the view](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m29s)

[directly question is did I do the right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m30s)

[one okay put a filter of five up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m34s)

[here to go here get rid of the five I'm](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m37s)

[going click on the clear](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m42s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m48s)

[in so I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m51s)

[think that is probably a better path](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m53s)

[rather than trying to fuss with it in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m57s)

[the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h55m59s)

[behind handle](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m01s)

[it in your view model with your view it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m03s)

[does mean you have to do something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m06s)

[slightly annoying like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m08s)

[this and and I intentionally did a hard](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m11s)

[cast here rather than like an as because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m14s)

[I didn't want to n check it on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m17s)

[end like if if you ever change because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m19s)

[if you ever change the default view type](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m23s)

[which is CH](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m28s)

[uh which would happen if you change this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m30s)

[collection but what are the odds you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m32s)

[ever change away from observable](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m34s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m35s)

[like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m37s)

[so hard cast this guy down to a list](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m39s)

[collection view to give you access to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m41s)

[the extra members and then I would](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m43s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m45s)

[I'd probably wrap a bunch of this stuff](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m48s)

[up similar to this um I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m50s)

[think you have is new](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m53s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m56s)

[item no you don't um I was going to say](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h56m58s)

[you'll get bit you'll also have to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m02s)

[something similar to this if you have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m04s)

[new item and again the question is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m07s)

[should you commit the edits or cancel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m09s)

[the edits like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m11s)

[it's I I think commit makes more sense](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m14s)

[based upon what you've said up elsewhere](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m17s)

[uh but is adding new is the other one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m19s)

[where you might end up having to to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m22s)

[it so yeah so something something akin](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m24s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m28s)

[that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m29s)

[um yeah uh and then if you'd](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m30s)

[like see uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m35s)

[see do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m40s)

[this use list](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m42s)

[view collection](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m45s)

[if you want the code copy Cloud patch](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m48s)

[link add is a specific view okay perfect](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m52s)

[yeah so if you don't have that enabled](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m55s)

[on your data grid you don't need to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m57s)

[worry about the ad](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m58s)

[case there is there's the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h57m59s)

[code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m05s)

[and stop](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m06s)

[debugging and there you're Off to the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m12s)

[Races and that is also a get Kraken](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m14s)

[Cloud patch](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m17s)

[So for anybody anybody wants to see it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m18s)

[like it so this is this is actually kind](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m21s)

[of a cool thing so on the cloud patches](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m23s)

[uh so one if you have get Kraken](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m26s)

[installed you can use one of the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m27s)

[happy buttons but if you don't you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m29s)

[just go get ken. deev and I already have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m31s)

[a get Kraken account if you don't have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m34s)

[one it'll prompt you to make a free](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m35s)

[account and all of that jazz but then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m37s)

[you you you get all of this it's like I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m40s)

[can share my commit and Off to the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m43s)

[Races so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m46s)

[easy easy mode with Cloud patches so you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m49s)

[can share them out um I will say do be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m52s)

[mildly cautious of leveraging this and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h58m56s)

[um like if you're working in a private](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m00s)

[repo and you make a public Cloud patch](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m02s)

[link right maybe don't do that because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m06s)

[in order for this to be able to show you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m09s)

[file to be able to show you this kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m28s)

[context so in my case it works great](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m30s)

[because this is a public repo great easy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m33s)

[to read the file out of anyone can read](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m36s)

[the public file if it's private then you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m37s)

[then we have to talk about setting up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m39s)

[Integrations that kind of thing um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=02h59m41s)

[all of that from a browser so if you're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m05s)

[on a machine without get Kraken you can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m07s)

[get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m10s)

[it okay uh I was writing a test](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m12s)

[I have applied the patch to my repo](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m18s)

[wasn't that easy wasn't that easy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h00m20s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m07s)

[absolutely it is by far my get tool of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m09s)

[choice like it's not perfect there are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m13s)

[there are rough edges and and like some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m16s)

[of the new repo management the Launchpad](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m18s)

[stuff like it's brand new like there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m20s)

[there there's there's some stuff to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m24s)

[worked out but the direction that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m26s)

[they're going and how quickly they fix](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m27s)

[stuff like it's hard to imagine another](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m29s)

[tool keeping](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m32s)

[up like I feel like Visual Studio has](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m35s)

[just now got around to having halfway](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m38s)

[decent git integration built](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m40s)

[in but I I can't see myself changing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m42s)

[it's I think it's too little too late](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m46s)

[okay so I wanted to write a test around](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m49s)

[here that tests the Max and Min stuff to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m52s)

[make sure that the coer stuff works](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m55s)

[properly is I think what we're going for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h01m57s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m01s)

[uh Max and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m05s)

[Min](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m08s)

[assignments](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m11s)

[uhse uh value to be in range okay so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m15s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m21s)

[this kill the minimum there so that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m23s)

[not set we don't need the plus button we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m26s)

[don't need the minus](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m29s)

[button we don't need any of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m31s)

[that uh we don't need any of this okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m33s)

[so we have the numeric up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m37s)

[down I don't think we need the text](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m40s)

[field because we want to just act on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m42s)

[the values itself okay so step one so we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m44s)

[want want to do uh numeric up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m47s)

[down uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m51s)

[minimum and we want to set the minimum](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m53s)

[to be let's do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m56s)

[three right so we will](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h02m58s)

[do wait blah blah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m01s)

[blah uh glad to see more C devs like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m05s)

[yourself on Twitch the language doesn't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m08s)

[get nearly enough love here as it should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m09s)

[I agree I absolutely agree dear Heavens](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m11s)

[stupid co-pilot showing off okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m15s)

[co-pilot write the rest of the test for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m17s)

[me uh oh uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m19s)

[oh uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m23s)

[oh now obviously this should be an air](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m27s)

[because if you set your maximum below](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m31s)

[your minimum that should not work](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m33s)

[actually what does slider do if you do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m36s)

[that just slider to if I change my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m40s)

[maximum it coerces the start](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m45s)

[first and it's only doing the selection](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m52s)

[start really you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h03m59s)

[allow](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m09s)

[really oh hang on what does this method](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m10s)

[do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m13s)

[sizing hang on there's no way there's no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m19s)

[way you you can't not no no no no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m21s)

[there's no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m26s)

[way there's no way that okay no no no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m27s)

[no I don't believe](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m32s)

[you I I I know what I'm reading but I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m34s)

[don't believe](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m37s)

[you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m39s)

[um Fields line](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m42s)

[up lighters why did I not see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m45s)

[oh because I can't read okay great okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m48s)

[so you're telling me if I make my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m50s)

[minimum 51 you're okay with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m53s)

[this there is no way that should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h04m57s)

[work if I set my minimum greater than my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m01s)

[maximum my world doesn't make sense](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m04s)

[anymore which might I add I now have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m08s)

[35 like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m13s)

[okay it's perfectly okay with that no no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m26s)

[that is no I am not no no no no no](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m31s)

[no I am not okay with this WPF I am very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m37s)

[much not okay with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m41s)

[this okay show me Max show me min](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m43s)

[okay so what did it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m49s)

[do so let's see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m54s)

[so minimum went to 51 so then it pushed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h05m57s)

[the maximum up to 51 as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m02s)

[well okay now this is something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m08s)

[dumb what happens if I do them in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m13s)

[opposite order](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m15s)

[and this is this is something that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m23s)

[occasionally bites on different where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m25s)

[you get slightly different behavior on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m28s)

[different zaml Frameworks as well](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m29s)

[looking at you.net](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m31s)

[Maui Min](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m35s)

[03:06:39,239 --> 03:06:44,080](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m37s)

really

[really I don't know how I feel about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m41s)

[this like I I get](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m44s)

[I get that we probably should make it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m48s)

[match the slider](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m50s)

[but no look at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m54s)

[that so this is this is probably what](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h06m57s)

[Nikolai was was remembering when he said](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m00s)

[that he thought minimum](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m03s)

[lead because if you have if you have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m05s)

[two somebody has to leave it's like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m08s)

[dancing you can't have both Partners](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m11s)

[lead one has to lead one has to fall I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m13s)

[am not a good dancer](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m17s)

[but I think the analogy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m20s)

[works okay so given](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m24s)

[that that's just so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m37s)

[weird so we should do these in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m42s)

[opposite order then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m45s)

[so the behavior that we expect right is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m47s)

[maximum goes to one get value the value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m50s)

[should get pushed down to one the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m53s)

[minimum goes up to three right the value](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m54s)

[should go to three and then obviously](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h07m57s)

[co-pilot the assertion is come on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m00s)

[co-pilot haven't you been watching the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m03s)

[stream come on write it no you fail](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m06s)

[here's a hint assert equal that's all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m10s)

[I'm doing for you come on co-pilot](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m13s)

[impress me impress](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m16s)

[me that's not impressing me here here's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m18s)

[your next hint](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m21s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m23s)

[three can you figure it out from](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m25s)

[that no how about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m27s)

[now about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m31s)

[now no you just you just fail okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m34s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m38s)

[right okay so for all people who are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m45s)

[worried about AI taking over good news](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m48s)

[co-pilot still cannot read my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m50s)

[mind um which is probably better for all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m52s)

[concerned okay so this is I think the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m57s)

[behavior we want right value starts at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h08m59s)

[two Min and Max default to int Min and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m01s)

[int Max respectively we bring the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m04s)

[maximum down to one that forces the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m07s)

[value down to one we then bring the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m10s)

[minimum up to three that forces the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m13s)

[value up to three and forces the max to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m15s)

[go up with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m17s)

[it I think then I want to do one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m24s)

[more](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m28s)

[thing oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m30s)

[co-pilot oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m32s)

[co-pilot you're an idiot but you were](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m40s)

[doing so good there for a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m43s)

[minute I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m46s)

[just so here's a question should this go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m48s)

[down to here because this isn't quite](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m52s)

[the same as the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h09m54s)

[zaml isn't quite the same as the zaml](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m02s)

[let's change this guy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m05s)

[here uh x.n](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m08s)

[name let's let's change one thing real](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m11s)

[quick because I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m14s)

[am d](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m16s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m18s)

[curious by lighter right okay so I want](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m20s)

[to I want to test this here with](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m24s)

[basically our exact same use case right](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m28s)

[so we're going to start at two and then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m31s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m33s)

[code right down here uh let's see let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m36s)

[do it on loaded just for sanity sake to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m40s)

[make sure there's no there's nothing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m43s)

[weird going on with timing because that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m45s)

[would be bad](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m47s)

[okay so my slider we're going to set](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m49s)

[the do this in the same order I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m55s)

[side](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h10m59s)

[there okay so we're going](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m01s)

[to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m05s)

[uh maximum gets](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m07s)

[one right and then we're going to just](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m11s)

[change yeah that's already two okay and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m13s)

[then we're going to come down here we're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m15s)

[going to do set minimum to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m17s)

[three right and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m19s)

[do maximum to two and I want to see the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m24s)

[results of that after we've moved it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m28s)

[around](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m32s)

[right because I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m34s)

[think the order in the Zam will may](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m38s)

[be maybe messing with this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m43s)

[okay maximum is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m47s)

[three so if you try to move the maximum](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m51s)

[below the minimum you get rejected okay](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m53s)

[so this should be this should remain at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h11m56s)

[three uh minimum should remain at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m01s)

[three and I see the question sitting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m04s)

[there just one second let's see what do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m07s)

[you think about spoken languages for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m10s)

[better employment Champion is like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m12s)

[learning Spanish German Etc I hear that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m14s)

[is good if the C needs people to travel](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m16s)

[for conferences to represent them um I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m18s)

[think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m21s)

[that I think that depends on the type of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m26s)

[role that you're going for so for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m29s)

[something for someone who is in like a a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m31s)

[developer relations job I could](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m35s)

[certainly see that being a very valuable](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m36s)

[asset for somebody who is just trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m40s)

[get a job as a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m43s)

[developer um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m45s)

[I think it'll depend a little bit on the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m47s)

[company like I've I've seen it be an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m50s)

[asset at places where companies have uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m53s)

[less about traveling for conferences and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m56s)

[representing them and more for if the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h12m58s)

[company has multiple offices distributed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m01s)

[uh around the world it can be very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m04s)

[helpful if you know if somebody has uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m06s)

[an office uh in Germany and one in Spain](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m09s)

[being able to have somebody who speaks](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m14s)

[Spanish and German to communicate across](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m17s)

[between peoples in different offices um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m19s)

[I've seen that be an asset](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m23s)

[before um for a regular develop](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m25s)

[developer role it's usually what's most](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m29s)

[important is that you can communicate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m32s)

[effectively with your team and with your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m33s)

[stakeholders and so unless the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m36s)

[language is valuable to your team or the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m40s)

[stakeholders I don't know if I would say](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m44s)

[it's that big of an asset for your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m47s)

[average developer I think that's the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m48s)

[only time I've seen it play a factor is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m51s)

[when either other members of the team or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m54s)

[stakeholders um were their their primary](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h13m57s)

[language was in another one that you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m02s)

[speak yeah yeah I speak three languages](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m06s)

[but only language that matters is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m11s)

[English yeah and I will say the the for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m13s)

[better worse a large portion of the tech](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m16s)

[World defaults to English a lot it's why](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m20s)

[you get so many bad localization](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m24s)

[implementations in so much software is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m26s)

[because everything just defaults to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m29s)

[English which isn't great but it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m31s)

[reflective of who built the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m35s)

[technology um english- speaking people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m37s)

[which is why that tends to be the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m40s)

[default uh let's see my University](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m43s)

[requires two semesters of a spoken](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m45s)

[language so I'm going to try to add](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m48s)

[Spanish to mme but yeah I imagine it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m49s)

[more useful for certain roles or GE](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m51s)

[geographical](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m54s)

[locations yeah and I think depending on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m56s)

[where you're looking to get a job if you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h14m59s)

[have choices of your language I would I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m01s)

[would tailor it around to where you are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m04s)

[hoping to be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m05s)

[employed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m07s)

[um I think that's that's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m09s)

[probably the where it's most likely to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m13s)

[be valuable again I see it being a the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m15s)

[biggest asset um around if that other](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m18s)

[language overlaps with team members or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m21s)

[stakeholders which stakeholders can be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m25s)

[project managers other internal users](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m28s)

[outside customers and so sometimes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m30s)

[that's not always not always apparent um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m32s)

[it could also be so I have seen some](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m36s)

[companies for new graduates they like to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m39s)

[hire them in in sort of either like uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m42s)

[QA or customer service type roles and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m46s)

[then promote into development um the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m48s)

[idea being that they want the new people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m51s)

[to learn the software from a user](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m53s)

[perspective first before they have them](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m55s)

[build it um I don't necessarily like](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h15m58s)

[that assumption I don't think it that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m03s)

[always like I get the idea and in cases](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m05s)

[it works but yeah like I worked for a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m07s)

[company that did that and it was like I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m11s)

[didn't like it very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m13s)

[much so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m15s)

[yeah uh I'd love to learn Mandarin in my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m18s)

[off time but I've never considered Rance](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m22s)

[to Dev work so that's neat](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m24s)

[though End Key still sticking yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m30s)

[and that's the thing is there's certain](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m34s)

[times](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m35s)

[where multiple languages can certainly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m36s)

[be valuable like uh my sister uh she is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m39s)

[she is not a software person she went to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m44s)

[school](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m47s)

[for I remember she has a business degree](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m48s)

[of some kind I don't remember exactly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m50s)

[what it was but she had did an emphasis](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m52s)

[in foreign languages so she knows](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m55s)

[Spanish she knows French um and it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h16m57s)

[been there's been times where it's been](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m00s)

[really handy having somebody like that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m03s)

[who can communicate um specifically](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m05s)

[because the the company she's working](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m09s)

[for they have users across the globe and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m11s)

[so occasionally you get a user whose](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m13s)

[first language is not English and it can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m16s)

[be really handy to have somebody who can](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m18s)

[communicate effectively](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m21s)

[um but I will say it hasn't been like a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m24s)

[a primary driver for her it's been sort](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m26s)

[of a secondary](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m29s)

[thing okay test written test should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m31s)

[fail okay and hopefully the test failed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m41s)

[at the very first assertion is what we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m43s)

[want to see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m45s)

[expected one actual two okay perfect so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m47s)

[we moved it down to one it didn't move](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m50s)

[down okay now we go and implement the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m52s)

[code to make the test](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m54s)

[pass darn it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h17m57s)

[Nikolai omandarin for Taiwan for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m04s)

[electric electronics and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m07s)

[parts yeah I could certainly see that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m10s)

[the intellitech at one point in time had](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m13s)

[a spin-off](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m15s)

[um sister company that was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m17s)

[building um industrial uh PCB printers](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m19s)

[so printed circuit](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m24s)

[boards um it's one of the few times in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m25s)

[my life I've written code for something](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m29s)

[that could actively kill me because I I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m31s)

[um my boss came in one day and I was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m35s)

[literally sitting on the machine riding](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m37s)

[it as it went up and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m39s)

[down because I was like why not this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m40s)

[thing is supposed to lift like 900 lb I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m43s)

[am not 9 100 lb therefore it should be](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m46s)

[fine to lift me but I was also conscious](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m48s)

[of the fact that I was running the code](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m51s)

[that was driving the motors that were](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m53s)

[going up and down I went you know it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m54s)

[might be bad if I accidentally like Miss](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m56s)

[a cut off switch and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h18m58s)

[you but I just trusted our electrical](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m00s)

[engineers that they had not messed](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m03s)

[anything up and it was](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m05s)

[fine I also that was also the same job](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m07s)

[where I I'm fairly confident I had the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m10s)

[world's most expensive foot](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m12s)

[stool It could only go up and down about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m14s)

[4 Ines and it cost tens of thousands of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m16s)

[dollars so an adjustable foot stol that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m20s)

[gives you know that much adjustment for](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h19m23s)

[want to coers on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h22m19s)

[contributor I have multiple repositories](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m11s)

[but like some of these are just open](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m18s)

[source repositories that I've submitted](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m20s)

[a PR to as well so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m21s)

[yes and material design is in there so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m24s)

[this code has somehow made it into an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m29s)

[grab the signature because I can never](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m44s)

[get these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m47s)

[right uh void and then these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m49s)

[two uh let's see and you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m53s)

[become void and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h23m57s)

[properties yeah it is it is really](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m06s)

[interesting the one that really got me](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m08s)

[was I I think they announced it at](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m11s)

[roughly the same time I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m12s)

[remember if there's even any](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m14s)

[relationship to them but the the storage](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m15s)

[mechanism on the glass because I think](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m17s)

[that's what it what it actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m19s)

[is in addition to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m22s)

[the like the actual way that they were](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m24s)

[storing it because Microsoft has shown](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m26s)

[off](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m29s)

[the the the way that they're able to do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m30s)

[some of that storage by like etching](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m32s)

[tiny itty bitty little stuff into glass](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m34s)

[it's just it's absolutely shocking in my](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m37s)

[mind like I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m41s)

[don't I I I can't rock](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m42s)

[how awesome that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m47s)

[is oh wait a minute oh wait a minute](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m49s)

[they're cheating this is a protected](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m51s)

[override reminds me of the golden record](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m54s)

[that NASA made oh yeah yeah yeah very](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h24m56s)

[similar and this is not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m00s)

[a this is not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m03s)

[a oh you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m09s)

[suck is this is actually all the way in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m11s)

[a base class](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m14s)

[which is then](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m19s)

[overridden which is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m21s)

[then let's see because this is on](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m24s)

[maximum change so there's their](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m26s)

[implementation and then they call](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m29s)

[this guess we should](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m33s)

[probably feel I feel yucky feel yucky](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m36s)

[doing this don't know why I feel yucky](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m39s)

[doing this this doesn't feel that bad](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m42s)

[um okay let's go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m46s)

[here um and then this is going to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m50s)

[be numeric up](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m53s)

[down see here let's go here](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h25m56s)

[here we don't care about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m00s)

[that we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m05s)

[don't this is wow it's actually double](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m07s)

[coercing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m10s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m17s)

[interesting I don't know if we need](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m19s)

[this I think this is actually all we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m21s)

[need so this should get it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m28s)

[past uh so dumb opening an issue and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m32s)

[closing it within five minutes is an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m35s)

[achievement yeah some of their issue or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m37s)

[some of their achievements](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m39s)

[are like I don't think I've ever](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m43s)

[actually gone through through and spent](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m45s)

[time trying to gain their achievements](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m47s)

[this should still fail but we should see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m51s)

[it fail at the next assertion so one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m52s)

[step at a time uh you initialize your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m55s)

[variables at the top for most of your](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m57s)

[projects I normally initialize it where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h26m59s)

[it's use I hear mixed opinions online oh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m01s)

[good question good question](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m04s)

[so there](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m06s)

[are two schools of thought um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m08s)

[and how you see it done often is an](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m14s)

[artifact of either somebody's uh first](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m17s)

[language that they](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m22s)

[learned programming language um instead](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m23s)

[of or their or their age in some ways](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m27s)

[because in Old School like C stuff um](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m31s)

[like there was actually performance](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m35s)

[stuff that went along with it in C it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m37s)

[literally doesn't matter um for example](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m41s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m50s)

[sharp. so if people haven't seen this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m53s)

[this is a glorious](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m56s)

[website so for example if I](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h27m59s)

[do no uh in equals z](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m02s)

[right um we can actually look at the the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m08s)

[compiled iil for this stuff um so Don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m13s)

[Panic if you haven't seen I before it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m16s)

[it it's not horrible um and you don't](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m19s)

[actually need to understand a lot of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m22s)

[this to get what's happening but uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m23s)

[quick summary when you compile a c](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m27s)

[application it compiles down into IL or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m29s)

[Intermediate Language it is a language](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m32s)

[that is similar to like x86 assembly but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m35s)

[it is not assembly um the important](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m39s)

[thing is then your runtime will take](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m41s)

[this and convert it into whatever a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m43s)

[Assembly Language your processor speaks](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m46s)

[you're on a 32-bit processor you get you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m48s)

[know 86 you're on 64 git processor you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m50s)

[get x64 if you're on an arm processor](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m54s)

[etc etc etc how you can build a c](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m56s)

[application and not have to worry about](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h28m59s)

[your target architecture but for local](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m01s)

[variables you'll note they're always](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m05s)

[declared right up at the top and so it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m07s)

[doesn't matter where where you actually](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m10s)

[assign them doesn't matter where like if](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m13s)

[I do](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m15s)

[uh Fu equals oh hey that's that's not](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m17s)

[cool zero right and I come down here and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m20s)

[then I declare another one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m23s)

[um you have to you have to type](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m26s)

[correctly right uh string bar gets Bo](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m28s)

[because that's not going to be confusing](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m33s)

[right if we look down here we can see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m35s)

[that both of these things end up being](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m37s)

[declared up up at the front so it in](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m39s)

[terms of like some of the reasons why](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m41s)

[people will initialize a variable at the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m43s)

[top of the bottom](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m45s)

[sometimes that is an artifact of again](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m46s)

[like a c or C++ background where people](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m49s)

[were told to do that because there are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m52s)

[performance implications to that uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m54s)

[whereas in C it literally doesn't make a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m56s)

[difference at least for local variables](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h29m58s)

[inside of a method they're literally all](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m00s)

[up at the top regardless of where you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m03s)

[put them the compiler does all the heavy](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m05s)

[lifting um fields are kind of a similar](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m08s)

[story uh uh uh let's not name it that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m12s)

[right uh Fields it doesn't matter where](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m19s)

[where they get declared they're always](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m25s)

[going to just be declared as a field](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m26s)

[here and whether they're](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m29s)

[initialized here which you'll note I've](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m31s)

[declared this field and directly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m34s)

[initialized it to 42 but you can see](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m35s)

[here the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m38s)

[Declaration there is no 42 assignment](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m39s)

[right we have to actually go all the way](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m43s)

[down here and what's secretly happening](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m45s)

[under the hood is the default](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m47s)

[Constructor that the compiler generates](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m49s)

[for us is actually what is storing the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m51s)

[value of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m53s)

[42 right so the the um the default](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m55s)

[Constructor even though I've done it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h30m58s)

[here we can see that this is the actual](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m00s)

[I for it which means it's not that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m03s)

[different than if I were to do public C](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m05s)

[it I need to quit doing that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m09s)

[um right b equals](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m13s)

[42 dang](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m16s)

[it starting to wonder if their thing is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m18s)

[doing it to me right so if I get rid of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m21s)

[this we can come down here and again](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m25s)

[even without knowing anything about iil](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m27s)

[we can start to see that this starts to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m30s)

[look real similar to what got](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m32s)

[generated right the only subtle](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m34s)

[difference](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m36s)

[between uh this and the other](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m37s)

[Constructor is you'll note that this one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m40s)

[is because we're in debug has these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m43s)

[extra no op calls inside of here whereas](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m45s)

[if you go to release](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m47s)

[mode you get a much more smaller](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m50s)

[Constructor right something closer to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m53s)

[what the compiler generated so when you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m55s)

[leave when you let the compiler generate](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m57s)

[it you always get optimized when you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h31m59s)

[write it yourself um in debug mode you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m01s)

[get extra no op instructions so that you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m04s)

[can have break points on like your curly](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m06s)

[braces right because technically you](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m08s)

[don't want any I instructions for this](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m10s)

[curly brace you want your code to go](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m13s)

[fast and that's one of the big](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m14s)

[differences between debug and releasee](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m16s)

[is there are extra instructions that are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m18s)

[inserted for debug builds uh that are](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m21s)

[not inserted for release](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m23s)

[builds simply to make your debugging](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m25s)

[experience](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m27s)

[nicer so that's why we com that's why](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m29s)

[locally we run with debug and why when](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m32s)

[we publish we always use release because](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m34s)

[we don't want all those extra](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m36s)

[statements um sharp labs and net fiddle](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m38s)

[need more advertisement yes yes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m42s)

[absolutely Ely like this this type of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m45s)

[optimization and and doing this kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m48s)

[thing like some people get really](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m50s)

[weirded out over I but without like we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m52s)

[didn't need to read anything like we](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m55s)

[don't need to know what these](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m56s)

[instructions are doing to kind of Reason](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h32m58s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m00s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m02s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m08s)

[so uh let's see this guy so say same](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m10s)

[idea here is it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m14s)

[uh drop a link as well um online running](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m18s)

[one there's technically also uh tr.net](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m23s)

[another one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m26s)

[um yeah try to try to verbally communic](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m29s)

[oh is it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m33s)

[down they may have they may have pulled](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m34s)

[it down it kind of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m36s)

[got uh let's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m42s)

[see and and they they used to have a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m43s)

[standalone site for it but they may have](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m47s)

[they may have chucked it this is what's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m48s)

[powering um if you've ever seen like the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m50s)

[runnable code samples inside of uh](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m53s)

[learn.](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m55s)

[microsoft.com tr.net is what's powering](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m56s)

[it so it's the which is it's somewhat of](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h33m59s)

[a difficult problem to do because it's](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m03s)

[like I want to write code in a browser](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m05s)

[but I want it to compile and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m07s)

[run and that gets to be interesting](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m10s)

[especially when you consider security or](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m12s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m14s)

[yeah let's see you spoke about PR size a](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m16s)

[while back should I continue to uh make](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m18s)

[demo mvvm toolkit PRS for each control](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m21s)

[or just do it all as](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m24s)

[one um I think per cont per control is](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m26s)

[slightly preferred only because it makes](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m32s)

[it it makes it easier on the review that](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m34s)

[way if there's feedback like one PR](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m38s)

[doesn't necessarily hold up the](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m40s)

[others so](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m44s)

[I if you wanted to do it all as one](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m46s)

[that's fine it's just it may take it](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m48s)

[longer to merge in because it's more to](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m49s)

[look through and if there's feedback and](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m52s)

[back and forth it you know one section](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m54s)

[can then hold up another section but](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m57s)

[it's not a big deal](https://youtu.be/XX703g-T4hE?t=03h34m59s)
