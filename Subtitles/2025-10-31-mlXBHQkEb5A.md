[performance increase of 2026 is pretty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h08m48s)

[good. There have been a small number of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h08m51s)

[bugs. Um, so far nothing that's made me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h08m54s)

[need to roll back. The one caveat, um, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h08m57s)

[had a colleague mention to me that if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m00s)

[you were doing Maui development, there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m02s)

[was some issue with iOS builds for Maui](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m04s)

[in VS 2026 that weren't fully supported](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m08s)

[or something about an SDK or I'm was not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m11s)

[clear on the details. So, just be aware](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m14s)

[if you're doing iOS builds on Maui,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m16s)

[maybe don't install 2022 just yet. Keep](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m18s)

[it there. But you can run them in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m22s)

[parallel side by side. So, good to go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m24s)

[Uh, okay. So, Enigma machine CS and like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m27s)

[for those people who are wondering](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m32s)

[what's going on, I do have live unit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m33s)

[testing on and running. Okay, I got to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m35s)

[get my window layout going. I got to get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m38s)

[my window layout going. This is This is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m40s)

[me sad. But I these green check marks](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m45s)

[are the live unit testing running. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m47s)

[as changes are going in, uh stuff is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m49s)

[happening. Okay. So, that comment may](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m52s)

[have been on an old one. Yeah. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m55s)

[see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h09m58s)

[I want to get rid of all of these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m01s)

[comments because these are now wrong](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m03s)

[because that's what we changed last week](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m08s)

[is we got rid of the idea that um rotors](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m10s)

[were all um a toz based](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m15s)

[because the the physical machine that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m18s)

[we're building is not going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m20s)

[related to that. Um, it can support](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m23s)

[arbitrary. Uh, this is possibly part of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m25s)

[the configure method.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m28s)

[Yeah, I think we were going to punt.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m31s)

[Would it be worth making these an enume?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m34s)

[Absolutely.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m36s)

[Um, this sort of looks like it could be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m38s)

[used to define the machine type. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m40s)

[And I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m43s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m48s)

[And this is likely something machine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m52s)

[type definition. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m53s)

[okay. Not sure I like the name swap.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m57s)

[This was I think the one that I was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h10m59s)

[looking at before. I think we did this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m00s)

[one last if I remember right. That's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m02s)

[where we ended. Plug board. And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m10s)

[remap is better.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m11s)

[This is an easy rename. Boom. And then I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m14s)

[just want to do a quick textbased search](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m18s)

[for swap to make sure because I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m21s)

[it's going to exist in some unit test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m23s)

[names. Yeah. So, we're just going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m24s)

[change these guys up. Let's do here. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m28s)

[then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m32s)

[uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m36s)

[I want to put a space in front of it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m39s)

[because I think I just want to grab the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m40s)

[ones where they where it starts that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m42s)

[way. Uh oh.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m43s)

[and then replace all three occurrences.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m47s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m50s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m52s)

[change those out because I see that in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m55s)

[the region. There's those three tests](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m57s)

[that handles all those. Bippity bop](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h11m59s)

[booya thing compiles. Go here. Go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m01s)

[Autocode the commit message for me. Get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m06s)

[cracking because you are awesome.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m08s)

[So, for people who haven't grabbed it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m15s)

[yet, um, and maybe I'll I'll pause here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m17s)

[real quick just to make a quick note on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m20s)

[that. Um, if we check out the release](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m22s)

[notes on Get Kraken, I'm going to skip](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m24s)

[151. These are just some bug fixes and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m26s)

[Electron update. So, huzzah. Um, I will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m28s)

[say if you are on uh Mac OS, if you are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m31s)

[experiencing performance problems, um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m35s)

[redownload the installer. The updater](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m38s)

[had a problem on Mac OS where uh some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m41s)

[chipsets were getting degraded](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m46s)

[performance. If you redownload and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m49s)

[reinstall that has typically fixed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m51s)

[most problems, but I wanted to highlight](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m54s)

[some of these performance ones in here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h12m58s)

[for what uh Git Kraken actually did. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m01s)

[in these repositories they were largely](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m05s)

[testing on the um Linux kernel](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m07s)

[repository just as a sample for big](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m10s)

[ones. Now depending on which repo you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m12s)

[play with um I saw some people mention](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m15s)

[like the Chromium repo the it it still](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m17s)

[was on the struggle bus on um so it is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m20s)

[it is much faster for certain things and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m22s)

[I think it's important to to separate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m25s)

[what those things are. things with large](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m27s)

[numbers of commits and things with large](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m30s)

[numbers of refs are a little bit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m32s)

[different. And by refs, I mean branches,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m34s)

[tags, those types of things. There's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m36s)

[still some work to be done if there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m38s)

[large numbers of branches and refs like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m40s)

[in the order of 10,000, right? If you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m43s)

[hit the five-digit mark, you still might](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m46s)

[be experiencing some performance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m49s)

[degradation. It's better. Um, and things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m50s)

[with like 3,000 branches much better,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m53s)

[much faster, right? But things that have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h13m57s)

[10K or more, uh there's there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m00s)

[definitely some struggle bus and again](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m03s)

[less RAM use. Um they shared a couple](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m05s)

[details with some of the ambassadors and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m08s)

[I did ask permission before sharing this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m10s)

[so nobody panic. Um the RAM use the the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m12s)

[reduction actually came from their](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m16s)

[logging system. So they had a bunch of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m17s)

[logging that was occurring um as soon as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m19s)

[you like loaded up the repository. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m23s)

[but by cleaning up and changing uh how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m25s)

[much and when their logs were going,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m29s)

[that cut down on their uh RAM use](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m31s)

[significantly. And I often think people](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m34s)

[forget about logging as a potential](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m35s)

[performance bottleneck. Um, which innet](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m38s)

[we have the the source generator logging](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m41s)

[methods, which is the the new faster](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m43s)

[performance way of doing things. I mean,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m45s)

[if you've got serial logger, otherwise](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m47s)

[you've got some async logging and that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m49s)

[kind of stuff built in as well. um which](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m50s)

[is great, but oftentimes people forget](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m52s)

[that even like console write lines can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m54s)

[be a major performance bottleneck. Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h14m57s)

[if you've ever written a console](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m00s)

[application that says dumps out numbers,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m01s)

[say 1 to 100,000,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m04s)

[just do a for loop where it maybe](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m07s)

[calculates the first thousand Fibonacci](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m09s)

[numbers and dumps them out. have one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m11s)

[with a console right line and have one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m13s)

[that just uses a string builder and does](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m16s)

[a console right line at the end and see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m17s)

[which one runs faster just for fun. That](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m19s)

[console right line call is actually kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m22s)

[of expensive. So things like logging out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m24s)

[to a console hitting a file those things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m26s)

[can really add up and again don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m29s)

[the exact details of what they changed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m32s)

[but that cut down on the RAM usage a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m34s)

[lot. Um and it's one of the reasons why](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m36s)

[the new version is noticeably faster](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m38s)

[which is awesome.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m41s)

[um of being able to go through and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m42s)

[actually clear all of this stuff up. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m44s)

[if you have not updated to the latest](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m47s)

[version of um uh 115 for Kraken, do so.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m49s)

[It is by far worth it. The other thing I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m55s)

[wanted to mention is they've been on a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m57s)

[quest for a while. Um they were using a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h15m59s)

[and I I can't remember the name. There](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m02s)

[was a um a a package that they were](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m04s)

[referencing for doing all of their git](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m07s)

[interactions. And the way they measure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m09s)

[their git performance is comparing how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m11s)

[long an operation takes in Git Kraken](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m13s)

[Desktop and how long it takes on a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m15s)

[terminal and with the terminal kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m17s)

[being the gold standard, right? Whatever](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m20s)

[git.exe does, however long it takes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m22s)

[git.exe to do it, if a UI application](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m24s)

[should be comparable to that or as fast](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m28s)

[as that because that's kind of the the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m32s)

[gold star benchmark of what you're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m34s)

[aiming for. So that's not necessarily](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m36s)

[tied into some of these lower ones, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m38s)

[these faster commits and checkouts, a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m40s)

[lot of what they've been doing is slowly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m42s)

[converting away from that library and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m44s)

[doing CLI invocations for a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m47s)

[operations. And obviously some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m49s)

[operations in Git Kraken, you know, you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m52s)

[may double click your mouse, but they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m53s)

[have to do multiple git things. So it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m55s)

[like it's not quite equivalent because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m58s)

[maybe that double click is doing three](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h16m59s)

[operations instead of one. But hey,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m01s)

[that's what you want it for, to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m03s)

[multiple things and make you go quicker](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m04s)

[rather than having to type all those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m06s)

[commands out. So, having all of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m08s)

[things in place is awesome, right? So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m10s)

[just want to highlight that. Okay. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m14s)

[back to these comments](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m18s)

[back and forth. Uh, let's see here. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m20s)

[did you write a commit message for me?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m23s)

[Oh, I'm on the wrong repo. There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m26s)

[Okay, we did the uh so we'll push that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m28s)

[and then we will mark](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m32s)

[this as done.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m35s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m37s)

[comment and resolve and we're good.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m39s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m44s)

[what didn't I literally just resolve](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m48s)

[that comment?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m51s)

[Let's relaunch. I feel like GitHub is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m53s)

[making fun of me. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h17m55s)

[okay. I want to load the hidden](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m01s)

[conversations because that's the whole](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m02s)

[point of doing this. Skipping. Skipping](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m03s)

[because those were going to kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m07s)

[punt.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m08s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m10s)

[Uh, okay. Good. Good.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m13s)

[Um, because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m17s)

[Okay. Done.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m22s)

[comment,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m24s)

[right? I'm not crazy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m27s)

[Resolve conversation. I wonder if the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m32s)

[the push triggered a reload or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m34s)

[something. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m36s)

[let's see. Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m39s)

[Gets or sets a ring setting. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m44s)

[we're going to grab this. I think we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m46s)

[going to drop the 0 through 25 portion](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m48s)

[of it since that's no longer valid.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m49s)

[But](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m53s)

[uh because this was ring setting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h18m55s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m03s)

[uh the ring setting specifies the rotor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m06s)

[position offset related wiring.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m07s)

[Yeah, I I am noticing that there is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m19s)

[something potentially weird if somebody](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m21s)

[calls this after the fact.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m23s)

[I'm kind of Do we call this setter? I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m27s)

[kind of tempted to make this setter](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m29s)

[private and force you into the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m30s)

[constructor.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m33s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m35s)

[Ring setting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m37s)

[Uh, this one is doing plus+ to adjust](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m41s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m46s)

[I don't know that it's true](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m48s)

[that it can only be set before use.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m52s)

[This isn't actually accurate because you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m56s)

[can change it after the fact. Now, it it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h19m58s)

[doesn't make sense. You've effectively](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m00s)

[redone your config, but it does still](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m02s)

[work. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m05s)

[Um, we'll do this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m08s)

[That is the wonderful thing about AI is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m17s)

[it is it has offered uh nice break](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m19s)

[points where I can pause and take a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m22s)

[drink. So we thank our AI overlords for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m25s)

[that. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m29s)

[We will resolve this one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m34s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m37s)

[there's already offset](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m42s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m49s)

[uh with the refactor.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m51s)

[There is more you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m55s)

[like to see here. Boom. Boom.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h20m58s)

[comment and resolve because in the last](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m03s)

[week's refactor we just kind of blast](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m06s)

[through a bunch of stuff and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m11s)

[put the e handled at the end so all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m14s)

[implementations are sort of the same as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m16s)

[some handlers could uh and you don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m17s)

[want to um yeah I mean that's fair I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m19s)

[don't know if it matters too much in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m23s)

[this case so the idea here is not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m25s)

[marking the event as handled until after](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m28s)

[See rotor control here is in the event](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m33s)

[that something throws don't mark the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m37s)

[event as handled. The thing is is in all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m40s)

[of these it's going to be this is almost](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m42s)

[always going to be coming in on a UI](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m46s)

[thread and so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m48s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m53s)

[because the exception is going to bubble](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m55s)

[up on the UI thread and bring down your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m56s)

[app. So, it's like eh not a huge deal](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h21m58s)

[either way, but we can make the change.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m00s)

[No objections. Um, just as a point of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m02s)

[reference that's worth calling out, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m04s)

[usually subscribe to an idea that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m06s)

[in a code review, it is the it is if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m10s)

[there is a suggestion made for a fix, it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m14s)

[is the author's responsibility to either](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m17s)

[justify](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m21s)

[uh where the code chain that the code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m22s)

[change shouldn't be made or implement](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m25s)

[it, right? Um, effectively saying that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m27s)

[the reviewer wins ties, right? Right? If](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m30s)

[two things are of equal weight, the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m33s)

[reviewer wins and the author should make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m36s)

[the change. That's just my opinion of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m38s)

[how things should go. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m40s)

[now with that said, it doesn't mean you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m43s)

[the the reviewer always wins. It just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m45s)

[means they they have the the bonus 51%](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m47s)

[to break ties.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m50s)

[So, we'll just do a thumbs up. Uh, looks](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m52s)

[like this is all commented out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m56s)

[Can it be removed? I think we fixed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h22m59s)

[this, but let's go check rotocontrol.cs.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m03s)

[Uh, yeah, this thing is dead. This was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m07s)

[me making a mistake when I was switching](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m11s)

[to a user control. So, that file just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m12s)

[needs to be nuked. So, both of those can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m15s)

[go in together. And I think, yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m17s)

[that's the same file. Great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m20s)

[We'll give it a thumbs up. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m23s)

[we're going to do this maneuver. This](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m28s)

[maneuver auto code commit. We're just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m30s)

[going to bust these out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m34s)

[And then I think we can probably mark](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m37s)

[this guy as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m39s)

[ready for re-review.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m42s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m45s)

[here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m49s)

[resolve](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m50s)

[and resolve.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m52s)

[Okay. Refresh.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m55s)

[Boom. Let's go back to the conversation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h23m59s)

[tab.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m00s)

[I'm really just wanting to make sure I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m02s)

[get through all the comments. Make sure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m04s)

[I've got everything handled. This is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m05s)

[possibly configure method. Yeah, I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m08s)

[kind of punting on these ones cuz I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m10s)

[think there was going to be a different](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m11s)

[approach we might take.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m14s)

[I think I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m18s)

[addressed everything](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m20s)

[except the stuff around the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m23s)

[machine config bits.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m28s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m32s)

[you had another idea](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m35s)

[handle this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m41s)

[Okay. So, let's we'll do that and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m44s)

[we'll let that guy sit. Okay. So, that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m49s)

[handles that. That's good. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m51s)

[Material design stuff. Now, we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m53s)

[switching gears. Just we're just going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m55s)

[to bounce back and forth. Um, why did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h24m56s)

[this fail?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m00s)

[This bothers me.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m03s)

[Let's see. Refusing to allow GitHub app](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m06s)

[to create or update without workflow](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m08s)

[permissions. Oh, okay. This makes sense.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m10s)

[So, the automerge](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m14s)

[I have a action that when dependabot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m17s)

[updates things. Uh, hopping through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m20s)

[miscellaneous PRs. Yeah. um effectively.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m24s)

[Um and then a little bit of auto mocker](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m28s)

[if we get far enough because I I now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m30s)

[have full rights on the repo and I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m33s)

[to roll a release out since we haven't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m35s)

[done one in like two years. So we need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m37s)

[one.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m40s)

[Um so this one I'm just going to force](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m43s)

[through because I don't want to give](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m46s)

[this workflow permission to edit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m48s)

[workflows. I think it's probably fine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m50s)

[that it fails and requires me to to bump](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m53s)

[these things through. So, that's fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m57s)

[That's fine. I accept that. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h25m59s)

[So, I saw one I think this was the one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m02s)

[that I saw commits coming in on earlier](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m05s)

[today.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m08s)

[Is this what I saw 3 weeks ago? 11 hours](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m09s)

[ago? Yeah, this is probably the one I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m12s)

[saw.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m13s)

[Okay. So, let's take let's take a a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m15s)

[little gander at this guy cuz I because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m17s)

[I know Corins was working on this ear.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m21s)

[Oh, my features are going to make it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m25s)

[Yes. Yes. I And now that I have full](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m26s)

[rights on the repo, I I want to get it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m30s)

[shipped. One of the only other things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m32s)

[that I'd like to address and I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m34s)

[know if you wanna I mean I know you have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m36s)

[oos and gobs of free time is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m39s)

[outstanding PRs right now are all around](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m41s)

[bumping framework stuff up because we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m44s)

[haven't done an update in like 2 years.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m46s)

[The the source generators and the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m50s)

[analyzers that are there are not using](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m52s)

[the new incremental source generator](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m55s)

[stuff. I think we probably have to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h26m57s)

[I think it's probably easiest to scrap](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m02s)

[and rewrite](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m04s)

[um because I don't know what's there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m06s)

[because it's not structured the way an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m10s)

[incremental source generator should be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m12s)

[written. It's it's just kind of wrong.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m14s)

[So I think we just have to bring it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m17s)

[forward in spirit and not do it and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m18s)

[address all of the the code stuff in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m22s)

[here. So yeah, like there's a there's a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m24s)

[bunch of Nougat packages and whatnot and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m28s)

[things I want to rev and all of that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m29s)

[stuff. So all of those things to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m31s)

[through. Okay. Um let's see here. So I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m34s)

[just want to check this horizontal and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m38s)

[vertical alignment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m40s)

[Uh stretch the content instead of uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m42s)

[this way consumers can align the content](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m44s)

[themselves. Setting the horizontal and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m46s)

[vertical. So, um, allows for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m48s)

[interactable content in the suggestion](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m52s)

[list box. So, yeah. So, the auto suggest](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m55s)

[box is kind of like a,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h27m57s)

[um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m00s)

[a combo box, only a little bit nicer.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m02s)

[See, I'm more free in two weeks. I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m05s)

[trying to restrain myself from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m07s)

[distraction in the meantime, which is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m08s)

[difficult for me. Yes. Yes, absolutely.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m10s)

[You have a presentation that you should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m13s)

[probably focus on. Hint, hint, nudge,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m15s)

[nudge. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m19s)

[and one that I'm happy to help you with,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m22s)

[as much as you would like. Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m24s)

[but yes, um, after that point, let me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m28s)

[know because like I said, I'm going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m30s)

[I'm going to try to get some of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m31s)

[things taken care of. Um, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m32s)

[that's before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m35s)

[because you'll note here before it's the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m37s)

[if you click on the the thing, it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m41s)

[doesn't actually clear it. Um and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m43s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m46s)

[I assume it's going to show the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m48s)

[interaction with the thing. Yeah. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m49s)

[you'll note it drops an item out of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m53s)

[list. So effectively gives you that kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m54s)

[of functionality to be able to do. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m57s)

[then the other thing the other key thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h28m59s)

[to note is um here in the alignment is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m01s)

[these are now left aligned. And I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m06s)

[I think that was probably the the key](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m10s)

[change. Um, yeah, cuz this is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m12s)

[alignment of the list box items. And is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m16s)

[this in a mile? This is not in a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m19s)

[milestone. So, let's fix that cuz I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m21s)

[think we're shipping this. And let me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m22s)

[put the issue along with it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m24s)

[The issue is already in there. Great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m28s)

[Okay. Um, let's take a look at the code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m31s)

[because I think we looked at most of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m34s)

[this already.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m35s)

[Okay. So, where are we? Auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m40s)

[CS is interactive element. So what is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m42s)

[interactive element mean?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m46s)

[Button base or text box or combo box or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m48s)

[hyperlink?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m53s)

[Oo interesting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h29m55s)

[This is interesting. I am tempted](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m02s)

[to say that this should be protected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m08s)

[virtual because I have a strong](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m10s)

[suspicion people are going to have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m12s)

[alternate opinions on this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m14s)

[The the the ca the use case that I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m18s)

[thinking of is people wiring up a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m20s)

[um a click handler to say a rectangle.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m24s)

[I I could see some or or an image or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m27s)

[otherwise. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m30s)

[uh, Copilot agent mode though is good at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m33s)

[getting dependencies up. I've really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m36s)

[liked it for upserting a bunch of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m37s)

[dependent bots. I don't want to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m40s)

[through individually and fix minor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m42s)

[fixes. I'm not sure I trust it for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m44s)

[source generator rewrites. So, I did try](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m45s)

[it on a source generator rewrite](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m48s)

[like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m50s)

[boy, it might be close to a year ago now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m53s)

[and it did a crap job. Utter crap job.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m55s)

[it is probably worth](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h30m59s)

[giving it a giving it another go just to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m02s)

[see what it does. Um because this was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m04s)

[before I had like MCPs available to me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m07s)

[with like context 7 and Microsoft docs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m09s)

[and otherwise like I I do wonder given](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m12s)

[all the additional context if it would](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m16s)

[do better on those. Um, the other thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m18s)

[is I've now got multiple samples of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m20s)

[better written](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m22s)

[um, source generators and analyzers that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m24s)

[I can just poach from because the stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m26s)

[that it's doing is not complicated. It](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m29s)

[really isn't. And so it doesn't I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m31s)

[there's probably more boilerplate around](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m36s)

[writing the source generators and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m38s)

[analyzers than there is actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m39s)

[implementing them. So that's that's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m42s)

[bad as well. Um, okay. So, this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m45s)

[probably okay, though. I feel like I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m49s)

[might push for a like I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m52s)

[block this PR for it, but I may push for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m54s)

[a follow on for this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m56s)

[Um, because I suspect interactive it is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h31m59s)

[going to need to be more than this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m03s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m06s)

[what is this inside of? cuz I'm almost](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m09s)

[wondering if the preview mouse down.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m12s)

[Boy,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m17s)

[the other thing that I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m25s)

[the other thing I'm wondering if the we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m31s)

[could put a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m35s)

[an attached or or have an attach an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m38s)

[autosuggest po uh autosuggest box](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m40s)

[attached property called is interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m43s)

[element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m46s)

[and then just decorate elements with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m47s)

[that attached property. And then if you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m49s)

[want an interactive element inside of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m51s)

[the list box, you're responsible for um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m53s)

[decorating that appropriately. That](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h32m58s)

[might be cleaner because then it's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m01s)

[tied to a specific type. It does mean to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m02s)

[get interactivity,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m05s)

[people have to know to go and set and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m07s)

[attach property.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m09s)

[I'm trying to decide if that makes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m12s)

[sense. Right? Because this this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m15s)

[handling a bunch of the common cases](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m17s)

[and I don't know how realistic it is.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m21s)

[Like this these four probably handle](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m23s)

[like the 90% case.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m26s)

[Like that's probably 90%. I'm just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m29s)

[worried about the other 10.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m32s)

[I'm torn. I'm a little torn.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m36s)

[I wish there was a way to set an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m39s)

[attached property](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m42s)

[on the children dynamically without](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m45s)

[causing problems. Uh, okay. Um, this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m48s)

[in the sample, so I'm a little less](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m52s)

[concerned here because we're just going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m54s)

[to launch it and look at it because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m56s)

[care more about how that does. Um, that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h33m59s)

[looks like there's probably some using](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m03s)

[cleanup, but that's not a big deal. Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m04s)

[let's see. the MVVM light all the things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m07s)

[which is awesome.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m11s)

[We have all of these items contained.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m14s)

[Great work here on leveraging newer.net](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m17s)

[stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m20s)

[Very much like this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m21s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m24s)

[Mountain Dew. Yes. Yes. Um here one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m27s)

[second. I'm gonna I'm gonna go grab I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m32s)

[gonna go grab something. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m34s)

[uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m37s)

[there. Uh, a buddy of mine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m40s)

[came through in uh earlier today and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m44s)

[sent me uh a message because he had](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m47s)

[found a deal on Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m50s)

[and then he showed up at my house with a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m53s)

[wheelbarrow of Mountain Dew. That's how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m55s)

[you know who your friends are right](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m57s)

[there when they show up with a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h34m59s)

[wheelbarrow of Mountain Dew.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m00s)

[Made me so happy. made me very very very](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m05s)

[happy. Um, should I have that much](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m08s)

[Mountain Dew? Probably not. Do I? Yes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m10s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m14s)

[yeah. Good item to add to your list.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m18s)

[They know how to influence the reviewer](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m20s)

[to get a PR through. That is true. That](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m21s)

[is that is very true. And I like the UI](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m24s)

[test here. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m27s)

[and I know the delay, like normally](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m30s)

[delay is horrible, but in this case the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m33s)

[delay is for the animation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m35s)

[and that's one of the things in WPF](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m38s)

[that's hard to do is know when an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m39s)

[animation has finished. You have to wire](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m42s)

[up on the storyboard itself. And in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m44s)

[order to do that requires digging](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m46s)

[through and it's much easier to just do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m49s)

[this. So, there's a handful of tests](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m51s)

[where we've kind of just slapped these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m53s)

[delays in um because this is the delay](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m55s)

[on the list the the popup with the list](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h35m59s)

[box opening. This is on clicking the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m01s)

[button to to close it. Verify the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m03s)

[assert. That all looks pretty good to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m06s)

[me. Okay. So, the question then I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m08s)

[is why did the pipeline fail it?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m13s)

[What was wrong? What failed here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m16s)

[What failed here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m20s)

[Okay, I thought I had a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m25s)

[I go. Yeah, if I go here and I just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m29s)

[scroll down, I can just scroll. Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m32s)

[Benjamin, you might know this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m37s)

[Is there a way because I have I I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m40s)

[the the output for GitHub on my tests.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m44s)

[Is there a clean way? I don't care about](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m49s)

[tests that have a status of skipped.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m53s)

[I would like to just not show show them](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m56s)

[at all because I've got a handful of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h36m59s)

[tests that are autogenerated that are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m01s)

[only meant for manual run after running](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m04s)

[a local CLI tool, but they clutter my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m07s)

[output so much because there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m10s)

[682 of them compared to my 396 normal](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m14s)

[tests.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m18s)

[So, it would be nice if there was a way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m20s)

[to not include those. And I don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m23s)

[how to write a filter to say not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m25s)

[skipped.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m28s)

[Um, does not select or close popup](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m30s)

[failed. Okay, so it's actually the new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m32s)

[test that failed.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m34s)

[Uh, let's see. Assert expected third](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m37s)

[item count to be equal to one but found](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m40s)

[zero. Okay, so let's let's grab this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m44s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h37m47s)

[I'm just going to wait until it's kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h38m49s)

[of the default in the the new one and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h38m51s)

[then rev ours up because we don't have a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h38m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m01s)

[are always a pain in the butt. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m04s)

[let's go here. Let's go UI tests](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m07s)

[these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m12s)

[because these should be most or this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m14s)

[should pick it up. I don't know if we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m18s)

[may see a seventh show up. I don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m20s)

[if the new ones in this list. I'm trying](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m22s)

[the list.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m28s)

[Yeah, I think once it compiles it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m32s)

[going to pick up a seventh test here. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m34s)

[think is what I expect.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m37s)

[the actual mouse. It doesn't do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m56s)

[simulated input, which means if you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m57s)

[touch your mouse mid-run, it absolutely](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h39m59s)

[will mess it up. Okay, let's run this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m01s)

[thing here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m03s)

[Okay. Well, good news. It replicates. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m07s)

[that may that makes it easier. That](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m09s)

[makes it easier. Let's just take a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m11s)

[little gander here. Uh so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m13s)

[get is suggestions open expected to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m18s)

[true but found false.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m21s)

[So let's go here. What line number is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m24s)

[this on?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m27s)

[Uh 230. Oh, that's the test line number.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m29s)

[Where's the assert failure line?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m33s)

[Huh?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m37s)

[Am I crazy? I thought the assert](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m39s)

[failures would show line numbers. Maybe](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m40s)

[I'm getting XUnits output confused. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m42s)

[okay. Assert that suggestion box is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m46s)

[open. True. It's not further down, is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m48s)

[it? Nope. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m52s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h40m58s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m00s)

[insert that get suggestion box is open](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m04s)

[true](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m06s)

[because the idea is we are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m09s)

[popping open the interactive list box.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m13s)

[We are grabbing the popup the suggestion](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m19s)

[list box](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m22s)

[and then we are clicking on a button](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m23s)

[inside](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m27s)

[this thing is grabbing a button moving](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m30s)

[cursor too. So I kind of want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m32s)

[await task](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m36s)

[delay. I don't know.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m38s)

[I want to uh So in theory move cursor 2](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m41s)

[shouldn't be necessary.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m45s)

[It shouldn't be necessary because uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m49s)

[leftclick is going to do the same thing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m51s)

[It it combi like left click combines a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m54s)

[move cursor, a left mouse button down, a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h41m57s)

[left mouse button up, and there's a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m00s)

[slight delay in there. Right. So, let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m02s)

[run this guy here with the delay in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m05s)

[there and just take a little look](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m07s)

[because I'm I'm not sure if this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m13s)

[maybe a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m15s)

[It's interesting. It didn't move.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m22s)

[It didn't move the cursor to the button.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m28s)

[That's interesting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m35s)

[That's very interesting to me. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m37s)

[kind of want to back this guy up a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m45s)

[little bit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m47s)

[Let's do the Let's Let's make Let's make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m49s)

[you noticeable as well, right? So, move](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m52s)

[keyboard focus cuz](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h42m56s)

[Yeah, cuz send input I don't think moves](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m00s)

[focus. Oh, wait. The thing shows true](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m03s)

[now.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m07s)

[Oh, are we just going too fast?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m08s)

[I wonder if the 50 milliseconds is too](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m14s)

[fast for the the pop-up opening.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m16s)

[So, there's that. There's that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m20s)

[And there's that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m23s)

[And I'm actually surprised](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m32s)

[that get is suggestions open is expected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m35s)

[to be true here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m38s)

[Let me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m42s)

[let me launch with debugging because I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m44s)

[maybe I should go look at this this test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m46s)

[control.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m48s)

[Um because that that might be the bit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m50s)

[that I'm missing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m53s)

[Okay. Breakpoint. Breakpoint.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m55s)

[Thank you. Okay. So, I should have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h43m59s)

[control here. If I go here and do a,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m01s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m05s)

[Bananas, beans. What are the pluses](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m07s)

[supposed to do? So, if I click here,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m10s)

[goes bananas, right? Goes bananas. Pun](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m13s)

[intended, right? Uh, apples plus.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m17s)

[So clicking these buttons](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m24s)

[should increment the counts. So it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m28s)

[expected to stay open.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m31s)

[So why](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m34s)

[Oh, interesting. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m40s)

[Okay, so that that makes more sense.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m43s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m46s)

[I'm surprised Git is suggestions is open](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m55s)

[and I'm I'm curious if this thing will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h44m58s)

[fail if I do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m05s)

[because it's clearly finding the button.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m08s)

[I'm wondering if the left click](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m11s)

[is not triggering the preview mouse down](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m16s)

[event.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m20s)

[That would be a very interesting bug if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m23s)

[that were the case because that would be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m27s)

[inside of ZAML test because I trigger a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m28s)

[mouse click.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m32s)

[Yeah, this is XUnit. Uh, sorry, no, this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m35s)

[is Tunit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m38s)

[There's there's the button.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m41s)

[Okay. So, that worked just fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m44s)

[That worked just fine. I am going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m48s)

[pause it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m51s)

[that what needs to happen is this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m53s)

[And we don't need any of this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h45m56s)

[Left click. And I I want to give this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m02s)

[guy a bit of a delay as well only](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m04s)

[because I don't want this test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m07s)

[accidentally passing because suggestions](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m09s)

[is open is true but the animation is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m12s)

[closing in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m14s)

[I think just delaying this thing because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m18s)

[I'm wondering if it's failing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m21s)

[due to the fact that the anim because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m25s)

[think the animation is 300 milliseconds.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h46m26s)

[bueno. That just it just makes it look](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h48m50s)

[ugly in my humble opinion. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h48m52s)

[that cleans that up. That cleans that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h48m56s)

[up. Okay. So, the other thing I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h48m58s)

[contemplating](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m00s)

[is should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m02s)

[the autosuggest box be filtering on type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m04s)

[because at a at a minimum I feel like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m09s)

[people are going to need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m15s)

[are going to need some level of control](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m18s)

[over this is interactive element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m21s)

[I feel like that's going to be a thing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m24s)

[I'm thinking what we might do.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m34s)

[Maybe we do both.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m40s)

[Maybe we do both.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m44s)

[Let's do both. Okay. So, here here's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m48s)

[what I'm thinking. because it's really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m50s)

[obnoxious if people have to know to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m52s)

[and add an attached property because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m54s)

[there's no way like IntelliSense is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m56s)

[never going to tell you to do that and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h49m58s)

[it's it's going to not be discoverable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m00s)

[and I see people getting bit by that and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m02s)

[like I said I think this is probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m05s)

[going to cover the 90% case pretty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m07s)

[effectively](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m10s)

[right fair enough but I do feel like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m12s)

[people are going to want some level of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m15s)

[control over this so to do that I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m17s)

[what we add is we do this. We go uh what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m22s)

[is it? Prop attached](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m26s)

[one of these. And we do nullable boolean](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m29s)

[I think is what we do. And then we do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m34s)

[get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m37s)

[is interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m39s)

[element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m42s)

[Right. Did that I'm always](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m48s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m52s)

[Yes,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m53s)

[there. Okay. So, the key thing here is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h50m55s)

[we'll do a nullable bool and we'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m00s)

[default it to null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m01s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m04s)

[and this will allow](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m05s)

[people to to change the default](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m08s)

[behavior, right? If the value is null,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m11s)

[we're going to assume they've done](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m14s)

[nothing and let the def and let the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m16s)

[default behavior flow through. If the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m18s)

[value is set, that's going to take](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m20s)

[precedence over anything internal to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m22s)

[this control. I think that's the cleaner](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m25s)

[way of handling this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m27s)

[cuz like I said, I I I just anticipate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m30s)

[people as soon as this is one of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m32s)

[features that I know as soon as we add](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m34s)

[someone is going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m37s)

[find an edge case. Um, original source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m39s)

[is not framework element. Oh, so we can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m43s)

[actually just do we don't need this as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m45s)

[here either. we can just go element](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m47s)

[because if it wasn't a framework](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m51s)

[element, we would have returned here and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m52s)

[we wouldn't have gotten down to here. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m54s)

[that'll that'll cover us there. So let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m55s)

[go here. Um if element is not null, uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h51m59s)

[let's see if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m03s)

[get is interactive element element is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m06s)

[bool, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m09s)

[Um so if this is set, right? If it's non](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m12s)

[null, we'll let this flow through. Else](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m16s)

[we will do the check. Otherwise, we'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m21s)

[walk our way up the tree.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m24s)

[Right. And I think we might even have a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m27s)

[helper for this element. Uh get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m29s)

[I think it's visual ancestry.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m34s)

[I think this is ours. Let me check.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m37s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m41s)

[yeah, this one is ours.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m45s)

[Is this a better one to use?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m49s)

[I think this is what we want.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m53s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h52m56s)

[uh, let's see. Select](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m06s)

[is uh interactive.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m10s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m15s)

[where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m18s)

[uh X](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m21s)

[uh is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m25s)

[X is not null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m29s)

[First or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m36s)

[Default](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m40s)

[default is false. I'll make this make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m42s)

[sense here in just a moment. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m44s)

[Uh static](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m46s)

[uh bool](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m48s)

[uh is interactive. I know you I saw you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m51s)

[doing it. Copilot.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m55s)

[Um dear heavens. Copilot. This is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h53m57s)

[horrible implementation.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m01s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m03s)

[let's see. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m05s)

[let's see where X is not null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m09s)

[first or default](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m16s)

[false](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m20s)

[then we can just do a return statement](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m21s)

[there. Right? So that'll cut that all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m23s)

[out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m26s)

[Let that flow all the way through. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m27s)

[then what we would like to do is we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m30s)

[would like to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m33s)

[this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m35s)

[is our implementation here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m37s)

[Turn null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m41s)

[Rename this guy to element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m43s)

[And then we put the I back in that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m46s)

[poorly cut off. There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m49s)

[So a little linky.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m54s)

[So gets the visual ancestry.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h54m56s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m02s)

[convert each element in the visual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m04s)

[ancestry to a nullable boolean or the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m06s)

[nullable boolean will be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m10s)

[um either the attached property set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m14s)

[value if it's non-null otherwise some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m16s)

[common default behavior to handle some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m20s)

[special cases otherwise return null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m22s)

[find the first value where it's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m25s)

[null. So it'll stop going up the visual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m27s)

[hierarchy as soon as it finds something.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m28s)

[Otherwise, if it reaches the top, it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m30s)

[goes false.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m32s)

[Right.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m35s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m36s)

[and actually I think we want to stop](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m43s)

[where X](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m45s)

[uh let's see because we want to stop. We](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m49s)

[want to stop at the um autosuggest box.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m51s)

[X is not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m54s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h55m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m00s)

[so that means this guy needs to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m02s)

[non-static.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m04s)

[Okay, because I don't want to I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m06s)

[want to iterate up past because that was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m07s)

[one of the issues with the old one too](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m09s)

[is it could potentially iterate past](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m10s)

[itself and we never really want to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m12s)

[past ourself. There's no point in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m15s)

[iterating through there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m18s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m24s)

[Okay, that should be pretty close. Let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m26s)

[just make sure we haven't broken](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m30s)

[anything here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m31s)

[Then we might go and add just a couple](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m38s)

[UI tests around the attach property as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m40s)

[well, just to make sure it's functioning](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m43s)

[as expected.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m44s)

[Like for example, I want to go and turn](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m48s)

[off whether that button is interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m50s)

[and see the other thing fail.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h56m54s)

[Hands up. Drink Mountain Dew.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m01s)

[And away we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m05s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m08s)

[so far so good. Okay, great. Great,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m11s)

[great, great, great, great, great,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m14s)

[great, great. haven't broken anything.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m15s)

[Okay. So, let's go here and I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m17s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m20s)

[uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m22s)

[Let's see. It's going to be underneath](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m25s)

[the samples](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m27s)

[and it's going to be autosugject boxes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m30s)

[with interactive. So, let's take a look](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m33s)

[at what this control is doing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m35s)

[Go away. I only want this ZAML. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m40s)

[So, there's an autosuggest box with a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m42s)

[template](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m47s)

[um this guy here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m49s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h57m58s)

[Um I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m02s)

[I think what I want to do is give myself](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m07s)

[effectively the same test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m12s)

[Let's just grab this for a moment. Let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m16s)

[grab this because we're going to beat](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m18s)

[this into submission for a moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m19s)

[Let's see here. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m23s)

[clicking button](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m25s)

[in non-interactive.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m28s)

[Uh uh how about clicking button forcing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m33s)

[non-interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m38s)

[and then our expectation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m45s)

[selects item](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m47s)

[and closes popup. Okay, so that's what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m50s)

[we want to do.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m54s)

[And then we want to grab the button](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m57s)

[itself. And then I want to do button dot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h58m59s)

[Uh set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m03s)

[uh oh does](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m07s)

[does zaml test do attached properties? I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m10s)

[don't remember. I don't remember. Uh let](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m14s)

[me look. So zaml test has a source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m17s)

[generator. I'm trying to remember where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m21s)

[I set it up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m24s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m27s)

[not there. Is it in my test base?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m28s)

[Generate helpers.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m30s)

[It does have generate helpers on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m32s)

[autosuggest box, but it does not set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m34s)

[attached properties.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m38s)

[Got it. Okay. Stymied by my own work.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m46s)

[Right. Because what I would really love](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m50s)

[to have is button](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m52s)

[set is interactive, right? and have that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m54s)

[method exist because most of these set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=00h59m58s)

[extension methods and they are they're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m01s)

[just source generated. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m04s)

[some are source generated inside of ZAML](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m08s)

[test because I source gen the the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m11s)

[default WPF ones, but you can have that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m13s)

[same source generator run against your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m15s)

[controls, which is what this test base](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m17s)

[generate helpers is doing is it's just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m20s)

[running the same source generator that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m22s)

[ZAML test runs on its library with the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m24s)

[default WPF controls and source jenning](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m26s)

[in the same extensions for your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m29s)

[controls, adding in whatever you want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m31s)

[there as well. So all of our kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m33s)

[custom ones we we gen stuff in. But um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m35s)

[let's see what is my callback. It's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m40s)

[something like in remote invoke or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m43s)

[remote execute. There we go. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m47s)

[see button. So this this is the this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m49s)

[the dirty the dirty secret is ZAML test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m53s)

[has a backdoor that's intentionally](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h00m58s)

[there as a fallback for when you want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m01s)

[do something that there's not an exposed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m04s)

[member for. Remote execute](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m07s)

[takes the generated Lambda function and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m10s)

[runs it inside of the context of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m13s)

[generated WPF app. So even though this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m15s)

[lambda is inside my test project, it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m18s)

[never going to execute inside my test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m20s)

[project. It's only going to execute](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m21s)

[inside of the remote app. So it's a way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m23s)

[for me to then go through and tweak](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m25s)

[this,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m26s)

[right? And then we want to assert is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m28s)

[false](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m31s)

[and then get selected index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m33s)

[Uh and then I want it is equal to two](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m37s)

[and I don't want to assert on this view](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m41s)

[model property,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m43s)

[right? Oh, that's the other thing is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m45s)

[this needs to be static.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m47s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m50s)

[and then we'll do this. This should now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m53s)

[pass as well](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m56s)

[because this should now demonstrate that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h01m58s)

[we can have a button that would normally](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m00s)

[default to interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m02s)

[and then goes through and and changes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m04s)

[And then what I want to do is I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m08s)

[change the text field](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m10s)

[that's in it. Failed. What failed?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m12s)

[Cannot execute non-static delegates. Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m16s)

[that's right. I forgot. This is dumb.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m19s)

[This is dumb. This this the So, this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m22s)

[not a bug with Zaml test, right? Cannot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m26s)

[execute non-static delegates remotely,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m28s)

[right? In order to uh get the the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m31s)

[function to invoke. The problem is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m34s)

[does not generate a static function.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m37s)

[Despite despite that this is not a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m42s)

[static function. Um this is a static](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m46s)

[lambda which just prevents capturing. It](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m49s)

[does not actually it's not the same as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m52s)

[this uh static](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h02m56s)

[uh void set is interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m00s)

[set non-interactive.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m10s)

[Yeah, we'll do that and then we will do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m13s)

[set non-interactive.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m18s)

[That is a static function. I know. Dum](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m20s)

[dum dum dum dum](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m24s)

[dum dum dum dum dum. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m28s)

[because the problem is if it's not a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m33s)

[selected index to be equal to two. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m43s)

[Wow. Really squinting at that. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m47s)

[believe me. Unless you're talking about](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m50s)

[my font size, which it is too small. You](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h03m52s)

[expected to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m01s)

[interesting selected index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m05s)

[Why did it not select the element?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m10s)

[Interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m20s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m22s)

[um that seems incorrect. So let's this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m24s)

[is why we write tests. Why](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m28s)

[we don't set selected index](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m38s)

[commit value? Do we not really set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m47s)

[selected index and only set selected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m49s)

[item?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m51s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m53s)

[that would be very okay. Hold on.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h04m56s)

[Selected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m01s)

[index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m03s)

[We don't set selected index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m04s)

[Izzy, merry Christmas.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m08s)

[Merry merry Christmas.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m11s)

[Um the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m13s)

[um Enigma app PR. Um I believe I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m16s)

[now resolved all of your feedback aside](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m20s)

[from the machine config stuff. Last week](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m23s)

[you said you had an idea on it. I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m26s)

[know. Do you want to hold the PR until](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m28s)

[we implement whatever set idea is or do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m29s)

[you want to let it go through? Because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m32s)

[think that building up of the machine is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m34s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m37s)

[that whole function is probably going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m38s)

[die in favor of something a bit more](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m40s)

[dynamic](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m43s)

[andor whatever idea you had.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m44s)

[So we don't ever set selected index on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m48s)

[an autosuggest box. Wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m50s)

[Wait a minute. This derives from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m55s)

[textbox.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h05m58s)

[Oh, this is a bad test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m00s)

[This is a bad test, isn't it? Because a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m06s)

[text box doesn't have Wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m08s)

[Wait a I am confused. Textbox doesn't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m11s)

[have a selected index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m14s)

[It's not a selector.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m17s)

[So, what? Huh?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m20s)

[I'm confused. I am confused. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m23s)

[uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m30s)

[Selected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m32s)

[index. Where the where the heck is that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m34s)

[coming from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m37s)

[Get selected index.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m43s)

[Oh, this is the selected index on the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m46s)

[list box.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m48s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m53s)

[let's see. Happy to ignore those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m54s)

[comments for now. We'll review and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m55s)

[approve when I get to my laptop in the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m57s)

[office. Cool. Yeah. And if you've got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h06m59s)

[feedback, just throw it back on there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m00s)

[and I'm happy to address.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m01s)

[So, um, I'm thinking the base library](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m04s)

[might be good or might be good or close](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m09s)

[enough for a a V1 and then we can pivot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m12s)

[gears and start focusing a bit more on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m16s)

[UI bits. So, I'm thinking that might be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m19s)

[what we do because I I I think I I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m22s)

[to play around with my colleague who was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m25s)

[talking to me about monoame.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m28s)

[Um I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m30s)

[I don't know enough to know what a good](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m33s)

[answer is. And I feel like I need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m36s)

[just try it and and play around with it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m37s)

[to understand](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m39s)

[the limitations he was mentioning. I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m43s)

[not sure are limitations I care about.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m45s)

[And so we'll we'll see. It may just be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m48s)

[uh like there's not a lot of like asset](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m51s)

[loading and that kind of thing. I'm like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m55s)

[I don't know that I care. So we'll see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m56s)

[how it goes. Okay. This get selected](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h07m59s)

[index is on the list box that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m02s)

[contained inside of it. Oh, this is not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m04s)

[relevant because this list box is being](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m09s)

[closed because the popup is going away.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m12s)

[This is a bad test in here. This assert](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m14s)

[is good up here because we know that the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m17s)

[popup is still open. So the list box](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m20s)

[hasn't been disposed of. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m23s)

[this should be this should now pass](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m27s)

[because I just deleted the assert that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m29s)

[was failing and it was the last assert](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m30s)

[in the test. So this should be a pass.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m33s)

[Yay. Works. Okay, that's that's what we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m52s)

[want to see. That is what we want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m55s)

[see. Okay, that makes me feel a lot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m57s)

[better. And now all we're missing is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h08m59s)

[positive case and then we're done. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m01s)

[then we are done. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m07s)

[uh, can WPF utilize AOT? Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m09s)

[no. And um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m15s)

[there are a number of things in WPF that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m21s)

[are very much reflectionbased that are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m24s)

[not AOT friendly, at least right now.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m26s)

[And I'm putting that not at least right](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m31s)

[now part because there is still a team](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m33s)

[at Microsoft working on WPF putting out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m36s)

[updates. Admittedly, it's a small team](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m38s)

[and if you look at their progress on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m41s)

[GitHub, it's slower because, you know,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m43s)

[it's a tiny team doing this, but they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m47s)

[like WPF is still being actively](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m49s)

[maintained and worked on. So, I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m51s)

[put it out of the running, but I I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m54s)

[there's a lot more stuff that are more](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m56s)

[likely to get done first. like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h09m58s)

[they they don't want to break back](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m03s)

[compat of anything because there's way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m05s)

[too much WPF code in the in the wild and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m08s)

[so anything that would be a major back](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m10s)

[compat break is like off the table.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m12s)

[Um because the argument is hey if you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m15s)

[want a more modernized thing that like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m17s)

[that's what we made WinUI3 for right um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m19s)

[but there are a number of things around](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m23s)

[like performance and generics and things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m25s)

[that I think that they could improve](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m27s)

[without breaking back compat and so I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m30s)

[suspect a little bit more in that front](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m33s)

[is more likely because at least they've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m35s)

[been keeping it up to date um trying to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m38s)

[update um like some of the newer DPI](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m40s)

[stuff some font related things. They did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m44s)

[some updates to support some of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m47s)

[newer uh Windows theming stuff which was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m49s)

[which was nice. So there's there's some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m52s)

[things that are still coming to it. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m55s)

[it's not necessarily great but you know.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h10m57s)

[Um okay. So I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m00s)

[is I want to give this guy a background](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m05s)

[color of transparent](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m09s)

[just to make him](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m11s)

[clickable because if you make a text](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m13s)

[block without a background color unless](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m15s)

[you hit exactly on the text pixels it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m17s)

[the click goes through. So we just want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m19s)

[to block out the whole box.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m21s)

[Um just trying to think about how to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m24s)

[speed up your test pipeline. Honestly,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m25s)

[the way to speed up this test pipeline](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m27s)

[the most um is cutting down the number](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m29s)

[of times ZAML test fires up a new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m32s)

[process. That's I think the slowest](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m35s)

[part. Um I can there's a few other](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m38s)

[bottlenecks that are never going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m40s)

[able to be fixed. I don't think unless I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m43s)

[change some assumptions I have. um like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m46s)

[the animations stuff because I am not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m50s)

[going very intentionally not going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m53s)

[through the accessibility layer inside](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m55s)

[of Windows to interact with the app. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h11m57s)

[am at the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m00s)

[um bidding of interacting as though I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m02s)

[a user and so I have to slow down as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m05s)

[though I was a user. I can't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m07s)

[realistically run any faster than the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m08s)

[world's fastest user. So things like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m11s)

[animations and transitions I just have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m14s)

[to have sleeps for and that's always](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m16s)

[going to like there's a certain number](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m18s)

[of task delays that I just can't delete](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m20s)

[from my tests. And so you could add](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m22s)

[those up and go there's a bare minimum](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m23s)

[of I'm already adding I don't know it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m25s)

[probably 45 seconds or something total](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m28s)

[across all of them and it's slow. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m30s)

[yeah, but the the process start is one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m34s)

[of the big hang-ups. And so I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m37s)

[refactored a lot of tests to where it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m38s)

[does one I think the autosuggest box](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m40s)

[does it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m43s)

[Yeah. So a lot of these derive from the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m45s)

[test base where this app effectively](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m48s)

[correlates to a single process start and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m52s)

[so it will launch the process once and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m55s)

[then it will just swap out the content](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h12m59s)

[inside of a window which is much more](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m03s)

[efficient because now I don't have to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m05s)

[restart the process but because there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m07s)

[statics inside of WPF there are some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m09s)

[things that once loaded in you can't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m12s)

[unload without killing in the process.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m14s)

[So there's there's stuff like that. See,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m17s)

[it's a bigger team than mine. I assume](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m20s)

[referencing the WPF team. I'm a team of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m22s)

[one split across three projects that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m24s)

[customers seem to require 24/7 365](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m26s)

[support. Ouch.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m29s)

[So short version, Izzy, you just need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m31s)

[invent the cloning machine. I I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m33s)

[that's the the solution. Let's see. X](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m36s)

[name and then we're going to call this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m39s)

[uh name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m42s)

[text box or text block.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m44s)

[That way that way we have an easy way of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m48s)

[grabbing this sucker. And then we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m50s)

[going to go back to our test and we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m51s)

[going to do the inverse case because now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m53s)

[I want to make it so when I click on the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m55s)

[text block it um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h13m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m03s)

[uh let's see. Oh, no. I actually want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m06s)

[do Well, I guess I do want the first](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m08s)

[test actually as my starting point.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m10s)

[Okay, so autosuggest box clicking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m12s)

[uh text block](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m18s)

[that is interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m25s)

[does not select or close popup. Yes,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m27s)

[that is what we want. Okay, so I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m29s)

[do this. I want to grab the element, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m32s)

[then rather than grabbing element](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m34s)

[button, I want to go text block and I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m35s)

[want to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m40s)

[name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m42s)

[text block.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m43s)

[There we go. Uh let's see. Text block.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m46s)

[And then we want to do text block](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m50s)

[leftclick](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m54s)

[and then verify all of these things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h14m56s)

[are true.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m02s)

[Um I don't think we need to assert on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m10s)

[the view model because this is verifying](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m13s)

[that the button click does a thing. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m14s)

[think in this case I'm happy with this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m16s)

[Yeah, I think I'm happy with this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m22s)

[because really I just want to verify](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m24s)

[that we're cutting out that we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m26s)

[shortcircuiting that preview mouse down](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m27s)

[event properly. Oh, wait a minute. Wait](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m29s)

[a minute. This isn't going to work. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m32s)

[didn't set the attached property. Duh.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m34s)

[Uh, okay. So I need this bit of code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m38s)

[here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m40s)

[and I need to do this and we want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m42s)

[call it set interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m45s)

[not non-interactive we want to go true](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m48s)

[and we want to go text block](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m51s)

[uh let's see and then rename](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m55s)

[text block](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h15m58s)

[and then we want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m01s)

[text block](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m04s)

[set interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m06s)

[There. Now it should work. Run test. Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m08s)

[the name of the fun. Uh say oh thank you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m12s)

[C# boy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m16s)

[That's going to break my test runner.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m21s)

[Don't I don't know. Okay. Let's let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m25s)

[recompile. When you when you rename the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m27s)

[test, it always breaks because it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m29s)

[matches by string.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m30s)

[I appreciate the call out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m33s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m36s)

[let's see. Have already been made to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m40s)

[choose a winner for next week. So, went](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m42s)

[with the option where the hotel has a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m44s)

[gym and a pool. Excellent.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m46s)

[Excellent. Excellent.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m49s)

[Izzy, am I allowed to announce what next](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m52s)

[week is? I haven't said anything about](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m53s)

[it because I was I was holding off.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m56s)

[Should should I say something? I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h16m58s)

[leave it up to you.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m01s)

[Okay. run test and then let's see how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m04s)

[this goes. Go for it. So, for people who](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m06s)

[are interested in the Enigma app, um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m09s)

[Izzy will be joining us not just as a a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m12s)

[person hanging out in the chat. He](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m15s)

[actually volunteered to jump on a call](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m17s)

[and go through um and so we will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m18s)

[probably be at minimum at least](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m22s)

[discussing the Enigma app and showing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m24s)

[off what maybe physical bits are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m26s)

[available. Um there's some cool pictures](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m29s)

[that I got sent that I was going to uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m32s)

[save uh and show then. So if you are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m35s)

[interested in Avalonia and Enigma and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m39s)

[what we are building there, come next](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m42s)

[week. It's going to be cool.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m43s)

[Uh CB boy, my pleasure. Greetings from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m46s)

[Argentina. Ah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m49s)

[welcome Argentina. Good to have you.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m52s)

[At least you are close to my time zone](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m55s)

[unlike Izzy who is I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h17m57s)

[pretty close to opposite side of the uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m01s)

[globe from me. Okay. Uh get auto suggest](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m03s)

[uh is open equal to true but found](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m08s)

[false. And I think we just saw that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m14s)

[so the question is when we click this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m17s)

[it's 5:20 a.m. Yeah. not completely off](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m19s)

[cuz I got I got uh 10:20 p.m. So, you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m24s)

[know, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m28s)

[but still 7 hours. I guess it's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m30s)

[quite 12. It's close. It's time zones](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m33s)

[are weird. And more importantly, at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m36s)

[least where I'm at, uh we still do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m38s)

[daylight savings time. So, come 2 a.m.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m40s)

[Sunday, uh my clocks are all changing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m44s)

[So that's why I will be sending you a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m46s)

[calendar invite, Izzy, because dear](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m49s)

[heavens, trying to do scheduling in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m51s)

[different time zones with daylight](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m54s)

[savings occurring between when you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m55s)

[schedule and when the meeting occurs is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m56s)

[a recipe for disaster.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h18m58s)

[Absolute recipe for disaster. So for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m01s)

[anybody following the stream, if you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m02s)

[don't follow daylight savings time,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m04s)

[understand that my stream is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m06s)

[an hour off for you next week because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m07s)

[reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Then you'll be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m11s)

[eight hours away. Yeah. So, I I hate it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m12s)

[I hate it. They in this country, they've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m17s)

[tried to pass uh laws](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m20s)

[uh fixing and getting rid of daylight](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m23s)

[savings.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m26s)

[They've repeatedly failed. I think they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m27s)

[actually tried last month or earlier](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m29s)

[this month or something. I saw a news](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m31s)

[article come across saying, "Yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m33s)

[didn't pass again." I'm like, "Dang, nab](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m34s)

[it. Dang nab it."](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m36s)

[Ours went forward Sunday just gone](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m40s)

[wait forward](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m45s)

[because the saying here in the US is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m47s)

[spring forward fall back because we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m49s)

[don't say autumn or at least in my area](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m52s)

[it's most people will say fall rather](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m54s)

[than autumn. So that's that's the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m56s)

[pneummonic to try to remember which way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h19m59s)

[to adjust your clocks. Even though most](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m00s)

[clocks nowaday just auto switch, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m03s)

[Like I think there's only I don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m06s)

[four clocks left in my house that don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m09s)

[smartphones and all that. Like they all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m13s)

[just they all just magically work. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m14s)

[don't have to worry about fussing with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m16s)

[my alarm. Like my phone's going to ring](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m18s)

[at the right time in the morning. It'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m20s)

[be okay. Um I think what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m22s)

[I want to grab this guy here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m26s)

[And then let me check and make sure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m33s)

[we're attaching the debugger to the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m35s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m42s)

[let's do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m47s)

[Trying to be funny. I was working at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m56s)

[silly o'clock on Sunday, so didn't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m58s)

[really notice a difference.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h20m59s)

[Uh yes and for you silly o'clock I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m03s)

[assume means ye insane hour. Okay so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m05s)

[there's that. What is element here? It](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m10s)

[is the text block. And if I look at the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m13s)

[text of this sucker I expect to see the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m15s)

[word beans.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m17s)

[Uh let's see text T. T is below I text](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m18s)

[beans. Okay. So it's the right element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m24s)

[Okay. So we come in here. Whoop. I got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m26s)

[to scroll a little bit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m29s)

[So, we're going to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m31s)

[um I'm just going to grab it here. Get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m34s)

[is interactive element. And this guy](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m37s)

[should have a bool.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m39s)

[Great. Hits there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m42s)

[Hits there. Is interactive is true. Is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m45s)

[interactive element. Goes here. Goes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m48s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h21m51s)

[closing the auto suggest box then?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m17s)

[Okay. So, that all worked exactly as I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m23s)

[would expect.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m25s)

[ripple left mouse button down.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m28s)

[Oh, because we aren't marking it as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m31s)

[handled. This guy is probably still](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m33s)

[flow. Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m36s)

[yeah. any so silio clock is anything](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m42s)

[from 2300 to 0600](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m45s)

[start time up to anything from600](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m51s)

[uh to 20](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m55s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h22m58s)

[it always sounds weird to me say 2000](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m00s)

[hours I believe that's the proper way to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m02s)

[say it but uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m04s)

[uh okay I was like why is that not going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m07s)

[away](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m09s)

[so I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m11s)

[the issue here is if it's an interactive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m15s)

[element.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m18s)

[Well,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m20s)

[I don't want to mark it as handled](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m23s)

[because I still need the click to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m28s)

[through.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m29s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m33s)

[Let's see. So, let's see. Benjamin](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m38s)

[subtle. So, I think I know about your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m40s)

[skip test. Oh, I wasn't trying to nerd](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m41s)

[snipe you. I was just asking.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m43s)

[Um, let's see. So, I uh let's see. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m46s)

[I'm using the GitHub actions test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m51s)

[logger. Yeah. Or so you think. It by](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m53s)

[default doesn't show skip tests. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m55s)

[that would be a bug. And in addition, it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h23m58s)

[isn't working perfectly with MTP yet.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m00s)

[So, maybe it's that. Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m02s)

[that is absolutely possible](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m07s)

[though. I think what is happening is you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m12s)

[switch to tunit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m14s)

[Oh, okay. Well, one I need to go. I feel](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m17s)

[like this is an issue I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m20s)

[subscribe to.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m21s)

[Yes, I want that. Uh, let's see. Have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m24s)

[you tried Rust? Uh, yes, a little bit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m27s)

[um if you are interested.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m30s)

[So I will not claim to be a rust expert.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m32s)

[Um but this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m38s)

[my side company. Uh me and Kalin and my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m41s)

[partner Kayn, he is a a good Rust](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m45s)

[engineer. I am a learning Rust engineer.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m48s)

[We'll put it that way. Um, it is I will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m51s)

[say it is very nice](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m54s)

[simply from the standpoint that once you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m57s)

[get it compiling, it's very fast, very](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h24m59s)

[consistent. It's usually very safe. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m02s)

[say usually because we're doing some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m05s)

[low-level Win32 calls and like once you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m06s)

[start interrupting with outside stuff,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m10s)

[some of the safety is all bets off. But](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m13s)

[with that said, um we did port uh a big](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m16s)

[portion of our library and tooling over](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m20s)

[to Rust. Um one because it was faster,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m22s)

[smaller, and the the safety meant highly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m25s)

[reliable. So yeah, Rust is a I think I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m29s)

[like the characteristics of Rust. The](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m34s)

[syntax](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m37s)

[I'm still struggling a bit with. Um, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m39s)

[have to like I've spent so much time in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m42s)

[.NET I can just look at it and my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m44s)

[happening.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m47s)

[I do not have the same level of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m48s)

[experience with Rust. Um, and it's it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m50s)

[very interesting and it it I I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m54s)

[think it is worth learning and it is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h25m58s)

[very awesome. Um, but it is coming from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m00s)

[the net world. It takes a little bit to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m04s)

[get your head around there. the the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m07s)

[memory borrower stuff it like I sat](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m09s)

[there with the docs for a while going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m12s)

[through it going over and over and over](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m13s)

[and I will say co-pilot was great](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m15s)

[because I kept just highlighting stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m17s)

[and going explain explain explain](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m18s)

[explain because I I needed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m20s)

[fine great it's awesome um but yeah so I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m28s)

[I think it is a good one see Izzy I'm a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m32s)

[bad rust engineer too for all this new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m34s)

[fangled stuffs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m36s)

[Um, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m39s)

[Let's see. So, here I removed your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m43s)

[logger entirely.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m45s)

[Uh, what you are secretly getting is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m49s)

[this. Oh, man. Benjamin, you did all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m52s)

[kinds of awesomeness.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h26m56s)

[Oh, you're right,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m09s)

[dude. You are on point.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m12s)

[Let's see. C is the best language about](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m16s)

[of all time. It's a fact. Um, if you ask](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m18s)

[me, like I I think so. Um I will say](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m22s)

[though like for for certain contexts](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m28s)

[Rust](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m33s)

[Rust is very very good. The thing is is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m35s)

[C is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m38s)

[older](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m40s)

[but it's also being updated so it has](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m41s)

[modern features as well. Right? So it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m44s)

[got because you on one hand you like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m46s)

[older stuff because it means it's battle](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m48s)

[tested. It's lasted through decades. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m51s)

[there's something nice about older](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m54s)

[languages that have stood the test of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m56s)

[time. Um, because you only get that if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h27m58s)

[something holds up over many, many](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m01s)

[years, right? Any language that makes it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m03s)

[past like a decade, there's something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m05s)

[good about it. Otherwise, there's no way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m08s)

[it would have it would have made it that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m10s)

[far. It doesn't mean the language is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m12s)

[great, but it means there's at least](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m13s)

[something good about it that it's still](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m15s)

[being used, you know, a decade later,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m17s)

[right? JavaScript, right? like there was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m19s)

[something good about it. I.e. it may](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m22s)

[have been one of the only reasonable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m24s)

[options, right? But there was something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m25s)

[good about it that kept it alive that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m27s)

[long. Cuz sometimes, you know, languages](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m29s)

[and frameworks, they come and go, they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m31s)

[come and go. But the ones that stick](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m33s)

[around, there's something about them](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m34s)

[that makes them worth uh using or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m36s)

[lasting. But the fact that C likenet](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m39s)

[comp, I'll plug this again for anybody](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m42s)

[who hasn't seen it um is coming up next](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m44s)

[month. Like I refer to this as Geek](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m47s)

[Christmas because it is literally all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m49s)

[the cool new stuff of everything that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m51s)

[coming. Um and I'm even giving a talk um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m53s)

[coming up in December on everything](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m57s)

[that's new in C.NET](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h28m59s)

[um which is going to be awesome. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m02s)

[Yeah. Benjamin may be a little biased in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m06s)

[case you're wondering. He may be in the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m09s)

[chat. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m11s)

[which is which is awesome. Yeah. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m15s)

[The they have less CVES poss](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m18s)

[possibilities. Yeah. I don't really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m20s)

[subscribe to that when people say that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m22s)

[certain things have less CVEes. Usually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m24s)

[what they mean is they're less like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m26s)

[they're less popular. Therefore, they're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m30s)

[less targeted. Like the things with the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m31s)

[most CVEes are usually the ones that are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m33s)

[the most popular and hammered on the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m35s)

[most. Shockingly, the more under the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m37s)

[microscope you put something, the more](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m40s)

[things you find, right? There's very few](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m42s)

[things that get put under the microscope](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m44s)

[and have fewer CVEes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m46s)

[So, um, like I might hold curl up as one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m49s)

[of the few examples that's like it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m52s)

[been under the microscope and it holds](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m55s)

[up, right? Okay. So, this guy is coming](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h29m57s)

[through.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m01s)

[It's blocking. And I guess what I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m04s)

[to know is what is causing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m06s)

[the autosuggest box to close because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m10s)

[statement properly.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m14s)

[So something is causing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m17s)

[something is causing this thing to close](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m24s)

[and I don't know what.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m28s)

[So, I think what I want to do is I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m31s)

[to I think I just want to grab it here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m33s)

[because this I think everything feeds](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m37s)

[into this all of the closed cases.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m39s)

[Yeah. Escape key. We shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m43s)

[hitting that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m45s)

[Lost focus maybe.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m47s)

[Oh, I wonder](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m51s)

[commit value. Yeah. So, we could be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m56s)

[coming into here. So, let's run this and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h30m58s)

[see if we're going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m00s)

[um but Benjamin, thank you. I'm going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m02s)

[go through that reporting stuff and see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m05s)

[if because I think you are probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m08s)

[right that my switch to T-Unit, I did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m10s)

[not factor in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m14s)

[that change.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m17s)

[And because everything just kept](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m19s)

[working, I'm willing to bet if I go back](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m20s)

[to an older one prior to that that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m22s)

[will find a different variant of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m25s)

[output I think is probably what's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m28s)

[happening. Um, okay. So, we are hitting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m31s)

[this good. Where did we come in from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m33s)

[Ah, it is lost focus.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m36s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m40s)

[So, I don't think this is correct.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m44s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m48s)

[let's see. Uh, Vulcan versus OpenGL. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m56s)

[heard OpenGL is a lot easier and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h31m59s)

[beginner friendly. Uh, but Vulcan seems](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m01s)

[uh like more futurep proof option. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m04s)

[uh, Flying Heer, I'm going to answer](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m08s)

[that this way. Um, just last week I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m10s)

[started looking into different options.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m13s)

[Um, that Enigma project I mentioned](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m15s)

[earlier is something where we want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m17s)

[put together a kind of a 3D exploded](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m20s)

[view of the of the machine working so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m24s)

[that people can kind of understand the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m27s)

[components. And so I was looking into](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m28s)

[options for effectively like I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m30s)

[need a full game engine because I really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m33s)

[just kind of want to have an exploded 3D](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m36s)

[models with some kind of basic](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m39s)

[interaction and a little animation stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m40s)

[going on.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m42s)

[I say I don't need a full thing, but I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m44s)

[don't know what I don't know. Um, I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m47s)

[not a game engineer. My understanding,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m49s)

[and again, take this with a grain of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m52s)

[salt because it's only been after a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m53s)

[little bit of looking, is both options](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m55s)

[are fairly low level. Um, depending on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h32m58s)

[what you're trying to do, at least what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m02s)

[I've been finding is most people aren't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m04s)

[writing at that level. they are using um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m07s)

[something put on top of each of those,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m12s)

[right? They are often times going with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m15s)

[say either a unity if you want to be all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m17s)

[the way at the top edge of the stack um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m19s)

[or like a mono game or or something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m23s)

[similar where you aren't dropping all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m25s)

[the way down to that level. I haven't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m28s)

[looked a lot at the Vulcan versus OpenGL](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m30s)

[stuff yet because I was one just trying](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m34s)

[to get my bearings on the uh layers and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m37s)

[where I needed to look for what I was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m40s)

[trying to accomplish. So, I might have a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m42s)

[better answer in the future, but I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m44s)

[still fairly ignorant on all the tech to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m47s)

[to know for sure.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m49s)

[So, I will say that. Um, okay. I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m52s)

[we were getting away with this before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m55s)

[because this was so the focus is moving](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h33m59s)

[from the auto suggest box but it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m04s)

[moving](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m07s)

[inside of the popup. So I think what I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m08s)

[can do is if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m11s)

[uh let's see this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m21s)

[I think what I wanted to do is check the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m23s)

[popup though. So where is my popup?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m26s)

[Uh auto suggest box list. Where is Oh do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m31s)

[I not actually know? I guess that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m35s)

[fine. Where's my apply template? What](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m38s)

[are my template parts on this? So, my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m41s)

[only templated part is a list box. So, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m43s)

[don't actually know that I'm in a popup.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m45s)

[I don't know that I'm in a popup. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m50s)

[but I think what I want to do is if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m53s)

[autosuggest box list](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h34m57s)

[is keyboard focused.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m00s)

[I think actually what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m04s)

[this. Um, is keyboard focus](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m06s)

[Oh, fly Hefer, thank you for the follow.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m11s)

[I appreciate it. Um, is if keyboard](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m13s)

[focus is true or is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m15s)

[keyboard focus within](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m20s)

[true,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m23s)

[right? Can I not do it this way? Thought](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m25s)

[I could get away with this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m28s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m30s)

[how do you do a a property pattern match](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m33s)

[with an or between two properties?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m35s)

[We'll do it the oldfashioned way. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m41s)

[uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m50s)

[Uh, list.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m52s)

[Hey, don't help me. C-pilot, that was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m56s)

[not helpful.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h35m59s)

[list dot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m00s)

[um let's see or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m03s)

[list dot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m06s)

[and then we need pns otherwise we run](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m09s)

[into the or and problem. There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m11s)

[All right. So this is a null check and a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m14s)

[pattern match into a local variable. If](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m16s)

[it's here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m18s)

[we return and we don't close our popup.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m21s)

[So I suspect because I've got the I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m28s)

[got the break point in here still right](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m31s)

[now. I should not hit my break point.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m33s)

[That is my assertion. Run test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m35s)

[The drinking Mountain Dew part is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m42s)

[essential for making sure that you have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m44s)

[appropriate amounts of uh cognitive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m47s)

[ability to read the results of your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m50s)

[test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m52s)

[Okay, there we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m53s)

[There we go. We did not hit that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h36m59s)

[selected index to not be equal to two.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m02s)

[Oh, that's just incorrect.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m05s)

[Should not select the item.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m09s)

[No, I think in this case because the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m13s)

[interactive element that we've set is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m16s)

[text block, the only way we would expect](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m20s)

[this to not go through is if the element](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m24s)

[itself handled the click, which a text](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m28s)

[block is not. So we are um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m31s)

[the list box item should select because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m38s)

[the text block does not handle the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m43s)

[click.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m47s)

[Okay. So we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m51s)

[just put this up here because that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m53s)

[kind of a long line. Um and actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m54s)

[let's bring this we'll do it like that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m56s)

[there. Now we should pass.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h37m59s)

[So, without debugging, hands up. No](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m02s)

[touchy keyboard or mouse. Let the test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m06s)

[run.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m09s)

[And then then I think I uh this will be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m11s)

[a much cleaner.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m14s)

[Yeah, there we go. That's what we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m16s)

[looking for. That's what we're looking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m18s)

[for. Okay, let's just make sure we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m19s)

[haven't broken anything with our](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m21s)

[changes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m23s)

[At least At least this will guarantee](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m26s)

[that we haven't regressed anything,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m28s)

[the material design project initially,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m40s)

[there was no good way to do these types](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m43s)

[of tests and it meant that there was a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m44s)

[couple releases where things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m48s)

[accidentally broke and every time before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m49s)

[a release, I would spend so much time](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m51s)

[testing stuff. The number of times this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m55s)

[has saved me from a failure is high.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h38m57s)

[Okay. So, there's all that. There's all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m28s)

[I've got a couple of my own apps that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m29s)

[want to update to 531](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m32s)

[when I update my own apps, I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m37s)

[occasionally find more pain points than](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m39s)

[there otherwise might be. And so I just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m41s)

[want to um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m44s)

[I I I kind of want to go through those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m47s)

[just as a way of making sure that I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h39m49s)

[oh, the flying heer. I saw someone else](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m06s)

[using Gemini, but it looked a lot like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m08s)

[chat GPT. Are they two different things?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m09s)

[Uh, great question. So there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m12s)

[there are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m16s)

[there are large language models which is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m19s)

[when people are talking about like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m22s)

[GPT41, Gemini etc. often times they are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m24s)

[talking about the large language model.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m28s)

[Think of it as the um it's kind of like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m30s)

[when people uh point to their computer](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m33s)

[tower and say that's the CPU. It's kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m36s)

[of more in a general general sense,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m39s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m41s)

[um the the large language model is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m42s)

[actual CPU component uh of it. But when](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m44s)

[people are using say chat GPT like going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m49s)

[through the web interface, those are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m52s)

[client applications that are usually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m55s)

[calling out to uh an AI service to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h41m57s)

[the interaction. So the lines get blurry](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m00s)

[and this is where things get get really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m04s)

[wacky, right? Because like in Visual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m06s)

[So, your chat GPTs, there's your uh 41,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m25s)

[5 mini, 50, those types of things. Most](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m29s)

[people think of chat GPT as going to the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m32s)

[website and talking to it that way. But](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m34s)

[there's AI services behind the website.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m37s)

[expose a lot more capabilities, more of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m47s)

[the developer level. It's kind of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m50s)

[difference between using an application](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h42m52s)

[it's not what your end users are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m00s)

[developer flow for we'll call them power](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m04s)

[are two different language models but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m11s)

[people may be mixing GPT gemini](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m13s)

[make that comment about Gemini only](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m18s)

[because inside of Git Kraken desktop,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m20s)

[always go through and pick different](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m36s)

[models um to be able to leverage those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m38s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m43s)

[stuff is set to Gemini 25 flash. They](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m52s)

[have a bunch of different ones in here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m55s)

[The default ones are we'll call them](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h43m57s)

[cheap models. They are very these, if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m00s)

[small caveat. If a major bug or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m47s)

[something comes up, I oftentimes try to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m49s)

[get a release out quicker if I know that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m51s)

[there's something in there that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m53s)

[blocking people. But the fact that we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h44m55s)

[all of these changes here for like these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h45m51s)

[key changes. These key changes are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h45m53s)

[generated from all the things that I put](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h45m56s)

[the release notes label on. So this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h45m58s)

[more or less all generated. I give it a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h46m02s)

[quick look over and go, "Yeah, good](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h46m04s)

[Okay. Okay. So that that'll get that in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h46m13s)

[these boxes, they will stay checked](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h47m10s)

[until somebody pushes a change to this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h47m13s)

[reviews, it means that you can come back](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h47m17s)

[bring it in. And often times that will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h54m06s)

[bite you because if B has a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h54m08s)

[another thing I would add into my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h56m56s)

[long as you're revving, you're fine. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h58m03s)

[and in our case, because we're using the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=01h58m07s)

[here. Reset my master to here. It's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h00m40s)

[because I I changed my master to point](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h00m43s)

[to a different remote. We're going to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h00m49s)

[that. We're going to go here back to my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h00m52s)

[That's actually a good point.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h01m59s)

[always send lots of feedback. They love](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m24s)

[feedback. I will say I we had a meeting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m26s)

[of the Get Kraken ambassadors this week](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m29s)

[Get Kraken team was I really appreciate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m33s)

[how well they take feedback. like they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m36s)

[don't like they don't have infinite](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m39s)

[resources so it's not like they can act](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m41s)

[on every bit of feedback or issue thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m43s)

[like everything gets prioritized like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m46s)

[any other dev team but they do accept](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m47s)

[feedback well which I very appreciate JC](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m49s)

[good morning good to have you about to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m53s)

[pivot we're about to pivot okay so this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m56s)

[is automerge](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h02m59s)

[that's going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m00s)

[uh gonna send it okay so now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m03s)

[uh been Been a while since I've done](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m07s)

[this. So, we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m09s)

[see how far back this is because we we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m10s)

[might have to do Oh boy, I've got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m12s)

[pending changes on one of these. Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m15s)

[fix 302.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m17s)

[And I've got generators and all kinds of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m20s)

[stuff. So, we're just going to stash](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m22s)

[where we're at because I got no idea](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m24s)

[where we're at. Okay, so we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m25s)

[stop there because my commits way back.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m27s)

[We're gonna go here and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m30s)

[we're gonna start with a Nougat package](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m32s)

[update because we we know we are behind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m33s)

[on our packages. So, let's let's just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m37s)

[address that problem first](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m39s)

[because we've got Dependabot PR sitting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m42s)

[out there like crazy. We got we got to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m44s)

[get some we got to get some stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m47s)

[moving. So, let's let's start with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m48s)

[getting ourselves up and latest because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m50s)

[it's like we are we are a bit old. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m52s)

[So, our global.json JSON. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h03m57s)

[Yeah. So, we're gonna](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m01s)

[we're going to just we're going to just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m04s)

[jump that sucker right on forward.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m06s)

[The nice part, I mean, as you've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m09s)

[probably figured out, is I had something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m11s)

[to do with this project. So, some of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m13s)

[these things are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m14s)

[brought forward.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m17s)

[Um, okay. And then we have all these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m19s)

[manages centralized packages. Oh, hey,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m22s)

[look at that. Let's do the same little](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m25s)

[magical](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m29s)

[my thingy. Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m31s)

[that it. There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m35s)

[We're going to add that in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m38s)

[And then let's just grab this thing up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m42s)

[Uh, let's see. Minor Velopac request.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m46s)

[Can the update exe have a -h to show](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m49s)

[available commands? I can never remember](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m52s)

[that it is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h04m59s)

[uh uninstall under pressure. Oh, that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m00s)

[a good point. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m03s)

[that's probably I'm trying to think if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m08s)

[there's any reason we can't do that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m11s)

[The only reason I'm hesitating is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m15s)

[because update exe is used as a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m17s)

[bootstrapper](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m19s)

[and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m22s)

[I think it's I think it's fine. I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m25s)

[we fixed the forwarding of it. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m27s)

[just in case](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m33s)

[uh you are unaware](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m35s)

[right. Um, oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m38s)

[oh, that's right. Because it doesn't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m49s)

[have a help output, these things don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m51s)

[generate anything. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h05m53s)

[that's so these reference pages are all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m00s)

[autogenerated](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m03s)

[but the CLI output is generated from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m06s)

[the help output.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m10s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m12s)

[yeah, documented documented is probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m17s)

[the first step, but you might get both](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m20s)

[as a way of doing it, right? Is you I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m23s)

[mean you probably get equivalent options](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m26s)

[here, right? Which will give you the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m28s)

[dash H. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m29s)

[because I think our our generator relies](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m32s)

[on d-help. I don't remember exactly, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m34s)

[let me let me put that in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m37s)

[Uh let's see vevelopac and then I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m41s)

[our docs repo is public.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m46s)

[Yeah, docs is public. Um issues.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m49s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m54s)

[yeah. So let's go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m56s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h06m59s)

[update exe does not show](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m02s)

[uh any](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m13s)

[not have any documented](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m15s)

[commands or options. There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m19s)

[So, we'll go we'll go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m24s)

[Uh, we'll go here. Here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m29s)

[Looking at the docs page. There.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m32s)

[Uh, there are no CLI options](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m38s)

[documented.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m44s)

[And I'm just going to screenshot it. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m50s)

[I Oh, I'm going to wait for my Carac to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m51s)

[close so that when I screenshot it, it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m54s)

[doesn't capture it. And then we'll just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m56s)

[do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h07m59s)

[Um, that way it's shown.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m01s)

[There we go. Yeah, I think that is very](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m07s)

[reasonable. Like at a bare minimum, we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m11s)

[should get it documented. I completely](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m13s)

[agree with this. I might just I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m15s)

[only hedging on putting in full help](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m18s)

[support.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m20s)

[Something in the back of my mind is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m22s)

[telling me we didn't add that originally](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m24s)

[and there was a reason because I think I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m25s)

[had done something around that before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m28s)

[and it broke the bootstrapping,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m30s)

[but it could have just been a bad](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m34s)

[implementation. This was pre us](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m35s)

[converting stuff over to Rust and so I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m37s)

[think some of those weirdnesses have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m40s)

[have been worked out. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m43s)

[but yes, if you are interested](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m47s)

[subscribe to that issue](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m51s)

[um and you will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m54s)

[and you'll see it get fixed because yeah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h08m56s)

[um I I am I'm going to hold off fixing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m00s)

[it right now only because there is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m02s)

[fairly big change coming with the MSI](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m06s)

[stuff and I am doing my best to not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m09s)

[that needs to merge](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m13s)

[There's there's a big like it's a big](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m16s)

[change much bigger than what we wanted](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m18s)

[it to be but it's it's necessary.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m21s)

[So, um, because it sounds easy of, oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m25s)

[we'll just add MSI support, but it's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m28s)

[just MSI support. It's also](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m29s)

[making Velopac handle non uh per user](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m33s)

[installs, right? That's that's secretly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m36s)

[the the secondary objective because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m39s)

[before everything was just uh per user](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m41s)

[installs and so with the MSI work, it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m44s)

[adding in the functionality to support](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m47s)

[per machine installs.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m51s)

[The vehicle just happens to be MSI, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m54s)

[it's it's going to open up a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m56s)

[other areas for us as well, which will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h09m58s)

[be better. And I think a lot of these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m01s)

[Nougat package problems probably go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m02s)

[away. Um, oh, shut up. You're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m05s)

[make me rev these individually.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m08s)

[Um, this is one of the problems that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m11s)

[I've run into quite a bit is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m13s)

[Microsoft dependency chain is a pain in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m15s)

[the neck. This is probably where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m17s)

[Benjamin would yell at me and tell me to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m19s)

[use Copilot to do it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m21s)

[Not not wrong. Um, actually, you know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m24s)

[what? Go pilot. Impress me.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m28s)

[Update all of my Nougat dependencies to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m32s)

[their latest versions. Go, Copilot.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m36s)

[Impress me.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m40s)

[This is absolutely something you should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m45s)

[be able to handle.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m47s)

[So, I'm signing because it goes and rips](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m54s)

[through each project file to see the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m56s)

[dependencies. I probably should have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m58s)

[told it it's centralized package](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h10m59s)

[management. It'll probably get there in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h11m01s)

[a minute because it's reading all these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h11m03s)

[Copilot, you didn't quite do what I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m11s)

[asked.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m14s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m17s)

[yeah, they put the setting in. They](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m20s)

[should expect people to use it. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m21s)

[No, absolutely. And it used to be there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m22s)

[was an extension I grabbed for a while.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m25s)

[Um, and oftentimes when I would log](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m44s)

[setting it was changing behind the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m49s)

[kicked back to me going, "Well, that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m53s)

[an extension problem, not a Visual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m55s)

[the appropriate setting behind the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h16m58s)

[this. This is an accessibility issue.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m01s)

[Yeah, so this is flagging a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m11s)

[vulnerability because this is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m13s)

[downstream dependency. So we just need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m14s)

[to bring this guy up to latest. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m16s)

[actually, maybe I don't do this one yet](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m20s)

[because this guy probably gets fixed by](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m22s)

[bringing these ones up. Okay, Copilot,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m25s)

[you you lose because you didn't do a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h17m28s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m21s)

[Uh let's see here. And then we are just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m22s)

[going to rev both of these guys up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m24s)

[because this library we actually have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m30s)

[three separate sets of tests just to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m32s)

[make sure we cover. We should probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m35s)

[add a TUN one honestly. Like that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m36s)

[probably not a bad one to do. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m39s)

[now after all of that, do I still have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m43s)

[that vulnerability?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m46s)

[Okay. So, it's still flagging it. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m51s)

[I'm now curious](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m54s)

[why. What's the reference?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h18m58s)

[can do the .NET CLI.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h19m03s)

[I guess it really doesn't matter who's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h19m07s)

[question.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m09s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m10s)

[let's rebuild and it should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m15s)

[fix it. Oh, I wonder if it I may not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m19s)

[need to Hold on. Let's kill this for a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m22s)

[minute. I may not need this. The fact](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m24s)

[that it's not building this guy may be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m25s)

[holding on to an old reference that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m27s)

[since been fixed, but because we have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m29s)

[build failures, we're not getting all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m31s)

[the way there. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m33s)

[Um yes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m37s)

[the this changed with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m45s)

[cert throws.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m47s)

[Yeah. So this got changed.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m50s)

[There we go. So that'll go there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h21m57s)

[Oh dang it. I hate that the tab complete](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m01s)

[for fixing is great, but I find that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m04s)

[occasionally get hosed by things not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m07s)

[working. Um, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m12s)

[here we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m19s)

[Close that up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m21s)

[This is this is how long it is because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m25s)

[this was a breaking change in XUnit when](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m26s)

[I when XUnit v2 went to I forget which](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m29s)

[version](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m33s)

[they rename this member or no this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m35s)

[wasn't XUnit this is MS test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m38s)

[Why did I think XUnit?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m42s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m47s)

[let's clean.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m48s)

[I'm tempted to go through.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m50s)

[We're gonna do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m55s)

[Just gonna make sure I get them all. Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h22m58s)

[because this will probably replace some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m01s)

[files.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m03s)

[Throws](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m06s)

[booyah. Replace all.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m08s)

[34. There. You've saved me some time.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m11s)

[Yeah. No, I've been so my day job I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m16s)

[been doing XUnit. My material design](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m20s)

[stuff I've been doing TUnit and I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m22s)

[been doing T-Unit in another one of my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m24s)

[private projects. And then this project](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m26s)

[I haven't touched in I think a year.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m29s)

[Let's see. And now we've got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m33s)

[true because we've got better analyzers.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m37s)

[That's fine. So, we're just being](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m41s)

[flagged by being flagged by analyzers,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m43s)

[which I'm okay with.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m46s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m48s)

[I wonder is there a do you have a use](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m51s)

[has count? Fix them all for me. Thank](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m54s)

[you. That's what I would like. Great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h23m57s)

[Clean all of them up. Um, you could go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m02s)

[xunit v3 unless you want both xunit and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m05s)

[xunit v3. I think I do. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m08s)

[because there's there's two separate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m12s)

[tests that I'll just call out here,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m13s)

[right? There's the actual test project](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m15s)

[for AutoMacher,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m18s)

[which is MS test, but we have source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m20s)

[generators that I need to make sure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m22s)

[generate appropriate code for XUnit,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m24s)

[NUnit, and MS test. And so I would like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m27s)

[those to work for both um XUnit, V2, and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m30s)

[V3. So, those we will probably add in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m33s)

[like I'll probably rename this to be V2](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m36s)

[and do a V3 and I will probably add T](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m40s)

[unit as well. Um, we just did these a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m42s)

[couple years ago cuz couple years ago,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m46s)

[these were your big three. If you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m48s)

[covered those three test frameworks, you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m49s)

[basically hit everybody.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m51s)

[Um, yeah, but use N substitute instead](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m53s)

[of mock. No, and that's totally fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m56s)

[Like there's I think like four](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h24m57s)

[maybeish reasonable mocking libraries](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m02s)

[that are out there and N substitute is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m05s)

[one of them. And this is some people got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m07s)

[a little annoyed at mockq.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m11s)

[Um because the author made a pretty big](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m14s)

[boo boo. Was it like a year ago, year](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m18s)

[and a half ago where um he was trying to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m21s)

[figure out how to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m25s)

[solve the problem of developer burnout](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m28s)

[and not getting support on an open](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m30s)

[source project. And he did it in a bad](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m32s)

[way that angered a lot of people via](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m35s)

[GDPR. And so that and it and it kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m38s)

[came through like he posted it on his](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m42s)

[blog but his blog didn't get a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m44s)

[readage or it didn't get a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m46s)

[attention and so then when the release](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m49s)

[went live uh yeah things went crazy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m50s)

[Need to add Striker. Yeah, you're not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m53s)

[wrong Izzy. You're not wrong. That's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m55s)

[actually on my list of things I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m57s)

[start adding because Striker is pretty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h25m59s)

[cool. Yeah, I heard about that. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m02s)

[And it was one of those things when it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m04s)

[happened, everybody freaked out and like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m05s)

[immediately like jumped to a different](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m07s)

[like, oh, we're going to refactor our](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m09s)

[entire test project to use a different](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m10s)

[um mocking library. And I was like, that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m13s)

[feels excessive. At a bare minimum, just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m16s)

[pin your Nougat version back before the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m19s)

[update. There was nothing in the update](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m21s)

[that anyone needed to take. Like, there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m24s)

[wasn't like bug fixes or anything else.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m27s)

[I'm like, just don't take the update.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m29s)

[Like the library has been stable for a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m31s)

[long time. There's not a lot of updates](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m33s)

[in it because there's not a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m35s)

[changes needed. So just don't and wait,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m37s)

[right? So I think people freaked out a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m41s)

[little prematurely, but okay. Anyway,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m43s)

[yeah, all those TFMs are still old by](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m47s)

[the way. Yeah. Yeah. Um, we are going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m50s)

[be bumping this to like I kind of want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m54s)

[to keep](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h26m57s)

[this library. I actually will keep older](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m00s)

[TFMs as possible](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m03s)

[until they cause me grief because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m07s)

[there's a lot of people using this on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m10s)

[really old stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m11s)

[But yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m14s)

[so there there will be a handful of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m16s)

[those that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m18s)

[don't get rid of. until I have a until I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m20s)

[have an a an absolute reason to let's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m25s)

[see what what are you yelling about here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m28s)

[is empty possible no reference exception](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m30s)

[assert is empty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m34s)

[uh let's see so resolved has a count of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m39s)

[one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m43s)

[resolved is a dictionary and it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m45s)

[expecting that the key is a string array](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m48s)

[and pulls it back out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m50s)

[Um I think the solution here is assert](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m54s)

[uh is instance of type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h27m58s)

[and we do string array here and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m05s)

[rather than doing an as we just do that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m09s)

[and then the problem goes away.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m13s)

[I think that's the better way of doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m16s)

[it. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m18s)

[C is instance of type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m21s)

[Let's see I service to array.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m25s)

[This way we get uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m31s)

[get nice asserts and nice type checks.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m36s)

[Okay, great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m38s)

[Uh let's see data test method is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m40s)

[obsolete.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m43s)

[Use test method instead. Yep.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m45s)

[There we go. Multi-target then before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m49s)

[release. Uh probably maybe I I want the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m52s)

[next release to go out with because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h28m57s)

[don't I need to review everything that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m01s)

[in it, but I don't think there's any](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m03s)

[breaking changes. And so I'd like to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m05s)

[ship it as is before I modernize it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m08s)

[That way people can bring in a handful](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m12s)

[of things because there's one bug in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m14s)

[here that I actually want to go through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m16s)

[and fix. So this one here, I actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m17s)

[want to get this bug fixed and out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m22s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m26s)

[partly because my team ran into this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m28s)

[this week and I didn't realize that I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m30s)

[was sitting there going, there's no way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m34s)

[there's a bug in Automark. Well, sure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m36s)

[enough. And apparently somebody else ran](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m37s)

[into it back in May. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m40s)

[okay. So, let's go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m44s)

[Uh, let's see. Explicitly enable or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m48s)

[disable test parallelization.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m51s)

[Um, okay. Can I not copy this? I'd](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m54s)

[really like to copy that URL out please](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h29m57s)

[because that would be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m02s)

[I assume I can do this in my build props](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m06s)

[which would be ideal.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m09s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m11s)

[bum](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m14s)

[assembly is not marked with assembly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m16s)

[paralyze or do not parallelize.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m18s)

[Uh the default configuration is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m22s)

[equivalent to blah blah blah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m24s)

[This is kind of annoying.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m30s)

[They don't show. So I assume what it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m32s)

[wants to see here is this assembly level](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m36s)

[attribute.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m38s)

[I'm tempted to do it with my directory](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m43s)

[build props, but I'm also a little](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m45s)

[hesitant](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m48s)

[because I have to do this in only some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m52s)

[of my test projects. I guess I'll just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m55s)

[embed it. Where's What do I What do I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h30m57s)

[got here? What is a reasonable tople](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m00s)

[class?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m03s)

[I don't know that I have one.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m05s)

[Let's just add a new file because I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m12s)

[don't see a good one here that I can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m14s)

[leverage.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m16s)

[Um, and so I think we'll just do this a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m19s)

[separate file. Wow. Really? That took](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m22s)

[way too long to load. Okay. And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m26s)

[we're just going to whack all the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m29s)

[contents and paste it. Nope.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m31s)

[Nope. assembly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m35s)

[parallelize done. Okay. So, you're going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m38s)

[to go there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m42s)

[and like your whole purpose in life will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m44s)

[be to do that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m46s)

[and then I believe you are the same.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m48s)

[Yeah. So, we're going to do the same](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m52s)

[file here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m55s)

[Okay. So, that should fix two of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h31m59s)

[errors.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m01s)

[And then we really just have the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m02s)

[generator problem.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m04s)

[Let's see. Generator example MS test.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m08s)

[And I think we're just going to copy](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m15s)

[this one into there as well.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m16s)

[Paste. There we go. So that all of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m20s)

[errors should go away. And now now I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m24s)

[think we're going to go and steal some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m26s)

[code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m28s)

[Wow, the indentation on this file is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m31s)

[horrible.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m33s)

[How did we How do we do that? That took](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m34s)

[That took some doing. That took some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m37s)

[doing. Is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m39s)

[uh We'll come back to doing that. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m43s)

[don't think we need to worry about the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m46s)

[cancellation token just yet. We'll want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m48s)

[to do that, but I I think we're about to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m51s)

[refactor all this code quite](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m53s)

[significantly. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m55s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h32m58s)

[yeah, non-incremental source generators](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m01s)

[are banned. So, this is where we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m03s)

[going to need to actually rev the source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m05s)

[generators forward into actual source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m06s)

[generators and functionally rebuild](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m10s)

[these because what we have previously is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m12s)

[garbage.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m17s)

[Okay. So, we are going to go here. We're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m18s)

[going to make a uh uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m20s)

[see updates. We're going to we're going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m25s)

[to make a commit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m28s)

[Uh Copilot did that kind of indentation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m31s)

[to a whole project on me yesterday.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m33s)

[Yeah, there's some things that Copilot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m35s)

[is absolutely amazing at. And then I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m38s)

[ran into an issue where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m42s)

[it like it wrote I don't know a 200line](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m44s)

[fairly complex method and I was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m48s)

[impressed at the function. Um but it was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m49s)

[inside of like it was uh PowerShell it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m54s)

[No, what was it?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h33m58s)

[It was a string literal um where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m01s)

[everything has to be indentation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m04s)

[indented at least as far as your closing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m06s)

[triple quotes. Right? Fine. Um and it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m08s)

[could not get that correct. It just it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m12s)

[went round and round and round and round](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m15s)

[and could not figure itself out. And I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m17s)

[was so annoyed at it. I I could not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m19s)

[believe that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m22s)

[like it wrote hundreds of lines of a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m25s)

[fairly complex method really well and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m28s)

[then couldn't figure out how to indent](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m30s)

[it. I was like, "Oh boy, oh boy. Oh boy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m32s)

[Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Okay, so we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m35s)

[going to start here. Submit. And I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m36s)

[this was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m39s)

[this was my attempt at updating a bunch](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m41s)

[of stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m44s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m46s)

[no. This is adding a compiler generator](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m48s)

[flag and all that stuff. We're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m50s)

[ignore all this for now. Okay, we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m53s)

[going to throw all that away. Okay, so I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m54s)

[would like to go and take a look at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h34m57s)

[so the way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m00s)

[um to write better source generators](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m06s)

[uh there is a wonderful](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m10s)

[repo So, I love the um community toolkit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m14s)

[stuff. Um Sergio is a freaking wizard](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m18s)

[when it comes to making](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m23s)

[uh code run fast and efficiently. Like,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m26s)

[if you see Sergio doing work, like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m30s)

[there's a reason the MVVM toolkit is as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m32s)

[awesome as it is. I I met him in person](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m35s)

[at the build conference this last year.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m37s)

[Great guy, very nice. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m39s)

[but I am going to blatantly poach what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m44s)

[he did for his source generators because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m47s)

[my opinion is he knows how to do this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m52s)

[stuff well. Uh, really well. And so we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m55s)

[are going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h35m58s)

[maybe I should just clone the whole](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m01s)

[repo.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m03s)

[That might not be a bad idea.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m05s)

[Yeah, let's just clone the whole repo.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m08s)

[No, I want this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m12s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m15s)

[yeah. Open.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m17s)

[Open says me.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m20s)

[Uh, let's see. Clone from URL.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m28s)

[Umn](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m31s)

[net](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m35s)

[uh community.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m38s)

[Okay. Uh clone repo.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m41s)

[There we go. I didn't need to copy the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m47s)

[thing. I just needed to use the button.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m49s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m57s)

[there we go. So, let's just pop this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h36m58s)

[sucker open and we're going to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m00s)

[blatantly steal some of Sergio's code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m04s)

[because when in doubt,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m07s)

[part of being a senior engineer is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m10s)

[knowing the proper people to plagiarize](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m12s)

[from.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m14s)

[Uh, yeah, shut up. Don't care. Don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m17s)

[care. Setup assistant is cool, but in my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m19s)

[case, I'm not actually trying to build](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m22s)

[this sucker. I am trying to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m24s)

[I need to look at what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m29s)

[source generator props project items](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m33s)

[label shared.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m35s)

[Oh, he has a shared asset project. Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m38s)

[yeah. Boy, Vi,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m41s)

[you did this hard mode, buddy. Okay. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m44s)

[so for people who are unfamiliar,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m50s)

[this icon here,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m52s)

[this is something that came out in I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m55s)

[think around the same time as you might](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h37m58s)

[have heard phrases like net uh net](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m01s)

[standard or what was the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m05s)

[there was a term for this where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m09s)

[Microsoft was trying to figure out how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m11s)

[to effectively handle um multiplatform](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m13s)

[form. This was early net core days and a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m16s)

[shared asset project was popular in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m20s)

[Zamron and I I can't remember if it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m23s)

[lived into Maui or if it died before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m25s)

[then, but the idea was it was kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m27s)

[this CS Progy like thing that all of its](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m30s)

[stuff got copied into the projects that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m35s)

[referenced it. So, it was kind of like a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m38s)

[poor man's import all my stuff, which is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m40s)

[what these things are doing. So all of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m43s)

[these projects that appear empty are not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m45s)

[actually empty. They secretly have all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m48s)

[this stuff inside of them.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m49s)

[So that's exciting, right? So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m52s)

[um yeah, so really what we care about is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m56s)

[here. Analyzers. Uh no, we don't want an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h38m59s)

[analyzer. We want a source generator.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m03s)

[Where's his generators?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m04s)

[Uh relay command generator. This is what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m09s)

[we would like to do.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m11s)

[Okay, so we want to pretty much throw](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m14s)

[away all of my code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m19s)

[per line](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m22s)

[and instead and actually here I realized](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m24s)

[I did I was not nice and did not share](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m25s)

[the link.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m28s)

[Here is the link if anybody's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m30s)

[interested. So I also have videos on my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m31s)

[YouTube on the MVVM toolkit um and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m34s)

[leveraging it in both WPF and Avalonia.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m38s)

[So, if you're interested, um, it is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m41s)

[absolutely awesome, especially for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m44s)

[people if you're new to MVVM stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m45s)

[Okay. So, cuz this is the relay command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m50s)

[generator, which I believe is probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m54s)

[just looking Yeah. So, it looks for the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m57s)

[relay command attribute on top of a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h39m59s)

[method and then generates out the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m01s)

[relevant code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m03s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m07s)

[Get the filtered sequence to enable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m12s)

[caching. Generate the command.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m14s)

[Okay, so this is basically the pattern](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m17s)

[that we want for incremental source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m19s)

[generators because source generators](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m20s)

[came out and the original API was sucky](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m22s)

[for performance. And so then they came](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m24s)

[out with incremental source generators.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m27s)

[And that's why because we've revved our](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m29s)

[C uh compiler uh Nougat package up, we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m32s)

[are now getting flagged and yelled at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m36s)

[saying don't use this anymore. Well,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m38s)

[okay, we need to.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m40s)

[So in this case, the entire point of and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m42s)

[I'll show it in XUnit land um is we have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m46s)

[this attribute inside of the automaker](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m52s)

[library because some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m54s)

[some projects that I have worked on,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h40m58s)

[excuse me,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m03s)

[got a tickle in my throat and I can't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m05s)

[make it go away. Some projects I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m06s)

[worked on have code coverage metrics and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m08s)

[I hate them, especially when there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m11s)

[minimum coverage numbers that your code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m13s)

[has to reach. Um, because code coverage](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m15s)

[does not tell you anything about the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m18s)

[quality of your tests. And so unless](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m19s)

[you've done something extra, often what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m22s)

[I see happen is people put null checks](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m25s)

[on their constructor arguments to verify](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m28s)

[that dependencies were appropriately set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m30s)

[up. fine except for those checks then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m31s)

[hit your code coverage numbers unless](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m35s)

[you check both the null and not null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m38s)

[case. Right? Right. That makes sense. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m40s)

[the problem is those are pretty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m43s)

[worthless test to write and I got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m44s)

[annoyed writing them. So instead I wrote](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m46s)

[a source generator with the automacher](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m48s)

[library that you can decorate your class](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m50s)

[with. And what it ends up doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m52s)

[is if I go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m55s)

[analyzers and I go automach generator](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h41m58s)

[and I look at this guy down here and I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m01s)

[look at this guy here, I can see it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m05s)

[generated out all of my tests for me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m08s)

[just to assert that particular](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m11s)

[parameters are null. It throws an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m13s)

[argument null exception and the argument](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m15s)

[null exception appropriately sets the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m17s)

[pram name. Right? So, because I did not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m19s)

[want to write all of these tests, that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m22s)

[was way too much bloody work. I'm way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m24s)

[too lazy for that. So, this gets me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m27s)

[around needing to deal with that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m30s)

[problem. So, I can source generator my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m32s)

[way to victory.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m34s)

[Um, we do also have uh this automacher](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m36s)

[options extensions. So if you are using](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m41s)

[I options](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m44s)

[um automacher will automatically](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m46s)

[generate this extension method for you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m48s)

[because we didn't want to take a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m51s)

[dependency on um the Microsoft abstract](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m52s)

[I think it's abstract configuration that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h42m58s)

[contains the I options interface. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m00s)

[instead what it does is it looks to see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m02s)

[if your project references that and if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m04s)

[it does it generates this extension](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m06s)

[method for you. So it's just a shorthand](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m08s)

[way of being able to add extra](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m10s)

[functionality based upon what your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m13s)

[library references like the because the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m15s)

[constructor generated one it generates](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m18s)

[different code depending on which test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m20s)

[pro test framework you're going against](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m22s)

[right if you are MS test and unit or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m24s)

[xunit right because for example here's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m27s)

[the controller class right so it's got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m30s)

[some constructors and it's null checking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m32s)

[all of these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m34s)

[uh let's see my job monitors code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m36s)

[coverage, but rather than a guideline](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m38s)

[for what the number should be, there's a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m40s)

[rule that a commit can't be merged to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m41s)

[main if it lowers the uh the coverage](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m43s)

[number. But I agree that coverage is at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m46s)

[best one of several metrics to evaluate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m48s)

[how good bad of job you're doing with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m51s)

[testing. Yeah, it and it and not to say](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m52s)

[that code coverage is a bad number. Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m55s)

[even on the projects I'm on, we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m57s)

[absolutely run code coverage and we keep](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h43m59s)

[those numbers. I just don't like the I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m02s)

[I get annoyed at the metrics that that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m06s)

[kind of force it into there. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m09s)

[that that's that's kind of my workound](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m13s)

[is because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m15s)

[you can sometimes get away without](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m18s)

[writing these null checks on your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m19s)

[constructor if you aren't building a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m21s)

[library. The whole reason why you null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m23s)

[check these things is because if you've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m25s)

[got nullable reference types turned on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m28s)

[and you know that you're the only](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m30s)

[consumer, you can kind of trust that the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m32s)

[the DI container, as long as you're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m36s)

[using the built-in Microsoft one or most](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m39s)

[of the popular ones, like they're going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m41s)

[to throw if they don't have an instance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m42s)

[to hand you, right? It's going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m45s)

[kind of hard to get a null through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m48s)

[there. And so doing this check is kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m49s)

[of worthless anyway. But if you're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m51s)

[building a library or where you can't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m53s)

[guarantee that the all the consumers are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m55s)

[going to have noble reference types](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h44m59s)

[enabled and actually address those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m00s)

[warnings,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m02s)

[now you might want to do it. And it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m04s)

[just I get lazy and do not want to write](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m06s)

[these things because you are right,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m08s)

[Izzy. Software engineers,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m09s)

[we are lazy and we absolutely will spend](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m12s)

[three hours automating something to save](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m16s)

[30 seconds.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m18s)

[We 100% will do that and we'll justify](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m20s)

[it that we'll get that time back in the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m22s)

[long run. Really, I think we get it back](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m24s)

[in our sanity rather than in actual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m26s)

[minutes. Uh let's see. Optimizing for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m29s)

[speed is hard. And see, we often trade](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m31s)

[space for time or time for space. Is it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m33s)

[the same in C?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m36s)

[Yes and no. Um the the running joke in C](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m41s)

[is you don't have uh performance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m45s)

[problems, you have memory problems,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m48s)

[memory problems, and memory problems. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m49s)

[because in a lot of cases, the slowest](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m52s)

[part of C is whenever the garbage](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m55s)

[collector runs. And a lot of speed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m57s)

[improvements that have come into C and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h45m59s)

[recently have been around reducing the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m01s)

[amount of allocations that are made](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m04s)

[because if you don't ever allocate the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m06s)

[memory, the garbage collector never](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m08s)

[needs to clean it up. means it doesn't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m10s)

[run as much, means it doesn't pause you.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m12s)

[There's also been some garbage collector](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m14s)

[improvements for being able to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m16s)

[parallelize things, not run as often,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m17s)

[different things in server and client](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m20s)

[mode, all kinds of cool stuff. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m21s)

[there is still times where you do do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m26s)

[that kind of space for time tradeoff in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m28s)

[in some cases, right? Um there was there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m31s)

[was some code I was working on I'm going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m35s)

[to phrase this properly where the data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m38s)

[set we were after there was a there was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m41s)

[a bit of a thing of well it's the query](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m44s)

[is kind of expensive of going back all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m47s)

[the time let's just load the whole thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m49s)

[into memory. Well shoot how big is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m51s)

[going to get? Like it's it's nice to say](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m53s)

[let's just load the whole collection](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m56s)

[into memory. that only works if you can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h46m57s)

[appropriately constrain the collection.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m00s)

[Um, but in this case, we're like, we can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m03s)

[constrain it down to only like a few](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m06s)

[hundred records. Okay, we can if we can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m08s)

[constrain it down to that, it's and we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m11s)

[know how big these records are going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m13s)

[get. It's not that bad to load it into](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m15s)

[memory, do all the calculations we need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m18s)

[to do, and then trash it, right? So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m20s)

[there's there there are some times where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m22s)

[that happens, but usually the space in C](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m24s)

[is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m28s)

[um memory allocations in a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m30s)

[of how much are we willing to bring in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m33s)

[um to be able to say hey this is this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m36s)

[worth doing. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m40s)

[but most of the time if we are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m43s)

[optimizing for speed](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m44s)

[we are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m47s)

[dropping into areas where we are looking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m50s)

[to avoid allocations like often times](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m52s)

[that's where the speed comes now there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m55s)

[plenty of cases where it's like oh yeah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m57s)

[you can change this algorithm that kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h47m58s)

[of thing like those things still happen](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m00s)

[too but I think more often than not when](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m01s)

[I see people optimizing C for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m03s)

[performance it's around addressing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m05s)

[allocations around addressing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m08s)

[allocations Um because with reduced](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m09s)

[allocations you also see you know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m13s)

[execution time improve as well.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m16s)

[Yeah. So not exactly the same but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m20s)

[there's the the themes are the same.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m24s)

[I'll put it that way.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m25s)

[Um because at the end of the day it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m28s)

[software engineering.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m31s)

[Okay. So, I want to go to my generator](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m33s)

[and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m38s)

[um let's start here cuz this one's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m41s)

[probably the easiest to do. Um actually,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m44s)

[this one is probably closer to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m48s)

[what the community toolkit is doing. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m53s)

[first things first, we only are going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m57s)

[run in C](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h48m59s)

[and we are going to go to town here. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m02s)

[we're just going to we're just going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m05s)

[start doing this one step at a time. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m06s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m14s)

[We're going to do this. We're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m16s)

[do this. We're going to just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m17s)

[We are just going to go down here and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m20s)

[I'm going to whack everything.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m22s)

[Come on, catch up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m28s)

[there. Ah, problem solved. We just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m33s)

[deleted all the code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m36s)

[Okay. And then go ahead and implement](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m38s)

[the interface. There we go. Okay. Gather](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m41s)

[information for all annotated method.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m45s)

[I'm just going to steal all of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m47s)

[code. I'm going to just steal all of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m49s)

[this because this is again](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m52s)

[Sergio is a wizard and being a senior](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h49m57s)

[from.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m02s)

[Okay, so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m04s)

[incremental values,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m10s)

[we might need to look at how much of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m13s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m15s)

[his code versus built-in stuff. So from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m17s)

[attribute with metadata name, let's take](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m20s)

[a look. Where is that coming from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m23s)

[This is his own code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m26s)

[for attribute with metadata name. This](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m29s)

[feels like something that I want.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m32s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m38s)

[cuz how does he limit it down?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m41s)

[How does he limit it down? Oh, it's the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m47s)

[second parameter here. If node is So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m49s)

[what is that second parameter?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h50m52s)

[provider](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m04s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m40s)

[so let's go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m44s)

[I want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m47s)

[something similar.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m51s)

[Open file explorer.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h51m54s)

[Shows how dumb I am. File Explorer](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m00s)

[opened and I tried to click on it in my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m01s)

[OBS. Turns out that doesn't work.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m03s)

[Uh, okay. So, we're going to go here. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m06s)

[am still curious why](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m09s)

[why they compile separate target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m14s)

[assemblies for each of their generators](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m15s)

[versus putting them all in one. That I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m17s)

[don't understand yet. Uh we will get to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m19s)

[that in a moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m21s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m23s)

[we're going to get rid of that, that,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m28s)

[and that and see what bites us.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m29s)

[If Roslin](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m34s)

[431 or greater.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m36s)

[Okay, what do we got going on? Is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m43s)

[external init not defined or imported?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m45s)

[Oh, because what are we targeting here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m49s)

[We are net standard 20. That that going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m53s)

[to be a problem. That that is going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h52m57s)

[be a problem.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m04s)

[what are you targeting?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m06s)

[You are targeting net standard 20. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m11s)

[how are you? Did you polyfilled? Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m13s)

[look at that. You polyfilled it in, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m16s)

[bet.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m18s)

[Um, so a nit is a keyword that is used.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m20s)

[Where is it? I don't see the polyfill](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m27s)

[for a knit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m29s)

[Um, there has got to be something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m32s)

[polyfilling a knit in here. Let's just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m35s)

[do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m38s)

[Um, that's not it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m40s)

[There's got to be a polyfill for this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m44s)

[somewhere.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m47s)

[Uh and the reason I say that is because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m54s)

[net standard did not have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h53m57s)

[that. And if we are targeting net](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m02s)

[standard on each of these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m09s)

[let's see uh how is uh Sergio able to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m13s)

[implement zeroation features in the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m17s)

[community toolkit? Was it made possible](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m18s)

[by new C features? Does it require](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m20s)

[assembly knowledge? Probably spent a lot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m23s)

[of time analyzing the generate assembly.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m25s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m27s)

[so uh it does not require nearly as much](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m30s)

[assembly knowledge as you might think.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m34s)

[So the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m37s)

[uh the library in question that is I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m42s)

[think basically the de facto standard](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m47s)

[for doing a lot of this work is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m50s)

[benchmark.net net um because it gives](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m53s)

[you a way of uh setting this stuff up um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h54m57s)

[as effectively a way of figuring out how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m03s)

[efficient or not efficient your code is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m06s)

[in terms of allocations CPU etc etc etc](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m09s)

[right it's a it's a great library and so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m13s)

[you will oftentimes see when people are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m15s)

[doing performance work on GitHub you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m17s)

[will see the tailtale signs of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m20s)

[benchmark.net net because you will see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m21s)

[this markdown chart get copied from the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m24s)

[output and pasted directly into the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m27s)

[GitHub issue to say like when somebody's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m29s)

[doing benchmark work it's usually here's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m31s)

[the benchmark this proves that you know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m33s)

[XYZ changes this much faster or has this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m35s)

[much fewer allocations or whatever it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m39s)

[going to be right of showing the before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m40s)

[and after um which is what this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m43s)

[incredibly good at doing right so this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m46s)

[is effectively whenever you see somebody](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m49s)

[doing performance work. This is often](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m52s)

[the proof that things are getting better](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m54s)

[or at least not getting worse. Um, and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h55m58s)

[what you end up needing to do to achieve](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m03s)

[that depends a lot. Um, and there is as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m07s)

[much art as there is science for it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m09s)

[It's usually less about the IIL. Um and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m12s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m17s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m20s)

[where is it? Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m23s)

[uh Steven](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m26s)

[blogs.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m28s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m34s)

[these blogs here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m38s)

[So Stephen Ta doesn't know how to write](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m42s)

[a blog. Um specifically he only knows](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m44s)

[how to write novels. So I will call your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m47s)

[attention](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m49s)

[to the the size of the thumb on this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m50s)

[scroll bar. Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m54s)

[this like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m56s)

[these things are packed with knowledge.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h56m58s)

[absolutely packed with knowledge of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m02s)

[fairly like if you want to know the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m04s)

[low-level](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m07s)

[C stuff, these performance blogs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m09s)

[are usually considered the de facto](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m14s)

[standard. You can see there's a there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m17s)

[a pattern in them that is emerging um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m19s)

[that that comes through here of all of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m24s)

[the stuff that goes in here. Um, often](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m26s)

[times people who who are doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m29s)

[performance improvements and here I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m31s)

[just actually you know what I'll just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m33s)

[paste in this one and then you can click](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m35s)

[on whichever one is relevant to you.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m37s)

[When it comes to how to optimize code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m39s)

[Stephen goes through a lot of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m44s)

[improvements that are coming in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m45s)

[either.NET NET or C because sometimes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m47s)

[it's language improvements, sometimes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m50s)

[it's framework improvements, a lot of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m53s)

[times it's the combination of those](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m55s)

[things coming together. So um several](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h57m56s)

[versions back we got like span and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m00s)

[readonly span which was a way of if you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m02s)

[imagine like a database view over a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m05s)

[table. span was kind of the the C#](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m06s)

[equivalent of the same thing where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m10s)

[rather than having to make uh multiple](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m12s)

[array allocations, you could kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m15s)

[just view sections of it. Um and so once](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m17s)

[again, cut down on allocations, better](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m20s)

[performance, which was great. Um and so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m22s)

[a lot of these improvements that come in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m24s)

[here um come from and again you'll see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m27s)

[him using benchmark.net going through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m30s)

[showing some of these improvements. Some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m33s)

[of these improvements you just get by](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m36s)

[updating your version of C andNET. You](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m38s)

[like some of the improvements they just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m41s)

[make the compiler better and faster.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m44s)

[And this just then shows how much where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m47s)

[is it of the same function going from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m50s)

[net to 89](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m56s)

[20 uh what is that 22%.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h58m59s)

[uh improvement. That's pretty good. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m03s)

[all they're doing is generating out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m06s)

[Now, do you need to do anything? No. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m08s)

[this is why you'll see people um like I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m10s)

[think Stack Overflow is usually one of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m13s)

[the big ones that posts it. Every time a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m15s)

[new version ofNet comes out, they](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m17s)

[usually update their system to it and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m18s)

[they oftentimes post a nice blog](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m20s)

[showing, hey, you know, we went from,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m23s)

[you know, net 8 to net 9. This is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m25s)

[performance increase that we see. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m27s)

[each version just gets faster. And so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m29s)

[often times just updating your app you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m31s)

[will pick up some of it. Some of it does](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m33s)

[come from areas where as people look at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m36s)

[the new features that are coming in. Net](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m40s)

[sometimes being able to leverage that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m43s)

[inside of your code. for the source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m46s)

[generators themselves. Um I know um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m48s)

[Sergio had uh access to a lot of very](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m51s)

[smart Microsoft engineers that know the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m55s)

[source generator stuff really really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m57s)

[well. And there was quite a few code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=02h59m59s)

[reviews done um to provide feedback.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m01s)

[And so I think some of it came from one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m06s)

[being a very good net engineer um and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m09s)

[understanding kind of the memory](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m13s)

[allocations because it may not be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m14s)

[obvious from from this here but there's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m17s)

[a different color green for syntax](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m21s)

[provider extensions than say this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m23s)

[incremental values provider and this was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m26s)

[one of the changes with the source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m29s)

[generators is they moved away from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m31s)

[classes and interfaces into strrus so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m33s)

[this lighter green again it's I I assume](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m37s)

[it's very difficult to see. In fact, if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m40s)

[I zoom way in, you can probably see the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m42s)

[difference between like say syntax node](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m44s)

[and cancellation token, right? The](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m46s)

[lighter green is a value type versus a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m49s)

[reference type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m52s)

[Um, reference types are allocated on the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m54s)

[heap, value types on the stack. And so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m57s)

[you avoid those heap allocations, lower](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h00m59s)

[memory allocations, fewer garbage](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m02s)

[collections, things go burr. Um it's not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m04s)

[just as simple like you can't just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m06s)

[change everything from a a class to a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m08s)

[strruct. Um but there are uh times where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m11s)

[that is a a fast and easy way of going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m16s)

[through and doing it. Some of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m19s)

[changes um and I think I saw referenced](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m21s)

[in the code that we just copied in is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m25s)

[even something simple like this this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m29s)

[record type, right? records are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m31s)

[inherently immutable. Structuring your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m34s)

[code in such a way and this is what the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m36s)

[because you don't have to worry about an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m53s)

[instance changing on you if it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m56s)

[immutable. Right? Every time there's a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h01m58s)

[change, it's effectively a copy or a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m00s)

[reference switch or or however it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m03s)

[going to work. But if your reference](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m04s)

[doesn't change, you don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m07s)

[about synchronization.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m09s)

[Um, except records aren't immutable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m11s)

[details. Stop making it hard, Benjamin.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m14s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m16s)

[things get weird, right? Things get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m18s)

[weird. Value pupil, another beautiful](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m20s)

[example of a nonimmutable value type or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m22s)

[a mutable value type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m27s)

[So it's it's just like so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m29s)

[yeah oftentimes I find that the people](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m32s)

[doing performance allocations don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m35s)

[necessarily spend a lot of time looking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m38s)

[at the IL but they often have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m40s)

[benchmark.net net up and running and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m44s)

[they are often times](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m46s)

[um at least aware of some of the common](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m50s)

[pitfalls, right, of how can I make this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m53s)

[code as fast and efficient as possible,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m56s)

[right? Cutting down on loops, cutting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h02m59s)

[down on nesting in conditions, early](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m01s)

[exits, being hyper conscious of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m04s)

[allocations, especially hidden](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m07s)

[allocations.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m09s)

[Um it like it may not be obvious in some](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m10s)

[cases. Uh I'm sure I've got some around](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m14s)

[here. Even things like lambdas inside of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m18s)

[link statements, there's allocations](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m21s)

[occurring there. So you'll see people](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m23s)

[who are hyperfocused on performance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m25s)

[work at re rejiggering code into a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m28s)

[different form that does the same thing,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m31s)

[but usually then cuts those allocations](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m35s)

[down. And again, oftentimes it starts](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m37s)

[with benchmark.net net to say, okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m38s)

[what is it currently at? Okay, if I make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m41s)

[the following change, is it getting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m43s)

[better or worse? And even just doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m44s)

[that and and knowing those kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m46s)

[techniques of going, well, where are my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m49s)

[allocations coming from? Okay, let's go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m51s)

[from there. The other thing I will say,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m53s)

[the new co-pilot inside of Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h03m55s)

[um does have a where is it? Where is it?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m00s)

[It's the the performance profiler.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m05s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m13s)

[yeah, I definitely use benchmark.n on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m15s)

[the occasion that I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m17s)

[performance tune. Yeah, it is it is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m18s)

[de facto standard. The the new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m20s)

[performance profiler inside of VS2026](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m23s)

[can also be really handy. Um I can't run](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m27s)

[it because I'm not compiling at the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m30s)

[moment. Um, but it can actually call out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m31s)

[and uh find quite a few spots in your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m35s)

[code where a lot of that lowhanging](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m38s)

[fruit where it's like, oh, if you just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m40s)

[do this other thing a little bit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m41s)

[differently, you can get better](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m42s)

[performance out of it. And it's worth](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m44s)

[noting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m46s)

[most of the time you don't need to worry](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m48s)

[about performance, right? I usually tell](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m51s)

[people don't performance tune. Um, oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m54s)

[is that what it is, Benjamin? Thank you.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h04m59s)

[oh yeah, app profiler. Thank you. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m02s)

[which is one of those things where the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m07s)

[the copilot in VS 2026 has a couple a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m09s)

[couple tricks up its sleeve that the one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m13s)

[in VS Code doesn't have. Um, still on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m14s)

[2022. Yeah, if you want to try it, you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m18s)

[can pull it down side by side. They do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m20s)

[they do happily coexist. it it is side](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m22s)

[by side which means it is you consumes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m26s)

[twice as much space because you have two](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m29s)

[of them now but they they can live](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m30s)

[independent of each other. Um but yeah I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m32s)

[usually tell people don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m36s)

[don't performance tune until you've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m38s)

[until you've written a a benchmark or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m41s)

[have some way of measuring that your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m43s)

[performance is going to go better.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m45s)

[Right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m47s)

[Like the general practice that I tell](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m49s)

[people is make it work, make it right,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m51s)

[make it fast. Those are the three steps](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m53s)

[in that order that the order is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m55s)

[important. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m57s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h05m59s)

[and not everything needs all three](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m02s)

[levels, right? Some things, demoare,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m03s)

[uh, simple proof of concepts, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m08s)

[Make it work is good enough, right? You](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m09s)

[can stop at step one.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m11s)

[uh some production level apps, line of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m13s)

[business apps, making it right is good](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m16s)

[enough. As long as your performance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m18s)

[doesn't tank, you're fine. Like you've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m20s)

[got a forced user base of like six](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m23s)

[people. Like we don't spend time](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m25s)

[optimizing for Perf in those cases,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m27s)

[right? Make it fast. Now you're talking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m29s)

[like big enterprise level scale consumer](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m32s)

[grade application, right? Like things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m35s)

[that have to deal with more stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m38s)

[Now, now you go into the the make it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m41s)

[fast, right? But usually until you have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m43s)

[a a use case and a test where you need a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m46s)

[performance tune at that level, the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m49s)

[individual functions in your code are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m51s)

[generally not that big of an issue.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m54s)

[Right? Optimizing your your data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m57s)

[retrieval for um your database queries](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h06m59s)

[or similar oftentimes can net you better](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m03s)

[PF than optimizing the C functions](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m05s)

[around it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m08s)

[Yeah, I generally try to write code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m11s)

[that's going to be reasonably perform](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m12s)

[going actual performance when we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m14s)

[starting to see performance issues.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m17s)

[Yeah, 100% agree. 100% agree. Like I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m18s)

[don't intentionally do things bad like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m20s)

[yeah, you shouldn't like just, you know,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m24s)

[double nested for loop over something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m26s)

[that you could dictionary look up. Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m28s)

[there's a handful of little things like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m30s)

[that like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m31s)

[iterating through an array to find the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m33s)

[element multiple times just to see if it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m36s)

[exists. Well, that's a hash set, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m38s)

[There's a there's a few of those kind of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m40s)

[small tricks where it's like, yeah, just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m42s)

[refactor that a little bit. Your world](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m43s)

[will be much nicer. Your world will will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m45s)

[get better. And then from there, you can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m49s)

[chase it out to see where it goes. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m51s)

[So, we snagged that sucker. But I am](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m54s)

[curious.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m56s)

[We still have like this hierarchy info.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h07m58s)

[What is this? What is this? So this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m01s)

[definitely](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m05s)

[model describing the hierarchy info of a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m07s)

[specific type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m09s)

[file name metadata name space.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m12s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m19s)

[Um I don't know that I actually care](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m23s)

[about all of this because I don't think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m27s)

[I need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m30s)

[most of this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m32s)

[at least not right now. So, what is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m40s)

[being used for? Because this is just a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m44s)

[record that contains a file name hint,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m47s)

[metadata name, and a namespace. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m51s)

[you'll note there's there's a a thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m52s)

[here that's intentionally being done](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m54s)

[where this is going to strings because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m56s)

[it's getting it down to to primitives](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h08m58s)

[um from type symbol and a lot of this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m02s)

[So this is another example of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m05s)

[performance-based code. Um when you do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m06s)

[this immutable array builder rent uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m10s)

[object pooling is another common](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m13s)

[technique inside of net cuz there is um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m16s)

[uh like array pools that you can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m21s)

[leverage or in this case array builder](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m23s)

[where it's giving you are you are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m25s)

[reaching in saying I need this space um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m28s)

[it will probably allocate once but then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m31s)

[as it's returned which is what this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m34s)

[using is doing it's sending it back,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m36s)

[it'll reuse rather than reallocate](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m38s)

[multiple times. So once again, it if it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m41s)

[never has to be cleaned up, garbage](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m44s)

[collector doesn't run, things go faster.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m46s)

[Um, okay. So this is just walking up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m49s)

[for each of the hierarchies, building a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m53s)

[new type info, which I assume is his own](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m55s)

[type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m58s)

[qualified name, type kind is record.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h09m59s)

[Whether the type is a record, I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m04s)

[think I care. Like I think I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m06s)

[need something similar to this,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m08s)

[but I don't think I need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m12s)

[like I don't think I need most of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m14s)

[because I think I'm going to need the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m19s)

[qualified name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m20s)

[because I'm hunting an attribute that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m24s)

[going to be on a class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m27s)

[I don't like I don't need a lot of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m30s)

[stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m34s)

[I think I really just need the qualified](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m37s)

[name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m39s)

[And I think that's this function here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m42s)

[Append fully qualified metadata name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m48s)

[And what is this doing?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m52s)

[Yeah, nested types append. This this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h10m59s)

[the stuff where I I was really hoping to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m02s)

[steal some code because this is where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m04s)

[I've gotten bit before where I feel like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m07s)

[this type of function should be built](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m09s)

[into the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m11s)

[the compiler ones](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m14s)

[or similar,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m17s)

[but it is not quite there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m19s)

[Okay. So, we probably are going to need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m24s)

[that because I think at the end of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m26s)

[day, I don't need this hierarchy info](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m28s)

[because the generation that I'm doing,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m34s)

[right? I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m40s)

[I want to make sure the auto mocker](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m43s)

[is referenced.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m46s)

[We want to the the language check is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m50s)

[fine, but I believe that's handled by](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m52s)

[the attribute for us. So that's no](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m54s)

[longer necessary.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m57s)

[We'll need to figure out the assembly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h11m59s)

[reference.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m00s)

[That's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m02s)

[that may not be necessary](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m04s)

[because this is brought inside. This is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m10s)

[probably something that can go away.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m13s)

[Um because this is just reporting out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m18s)

[diagnostics.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m21s)

[This is figuring out which of the test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m25s)

[frameworks we need. Sorry, I'm just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m28s)

[looking at what I actually need to get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m29s)

[this because this is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m31s)

[context syntax receiver](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m37s)

[because this is the guy that's act that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m40s)

[was previously ripping through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m43s)

[all of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m46s)

[all of the code to find where um the bit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m49s)

[was. And this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m53s)

[this bit here I think is what I need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m56s)

[convert over to what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h12m58s)

[Sergio was doing because this is going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m02s)

[through the the Roslin syntax tree, the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m05s)

[abstract syntax tree as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m09s)

[to find the relevant bits because all I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m12s)

[care about is is it a class?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m15s)

[Check the attributes. Does the attribute](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m19s)

[match mine?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m22s)

[And if it does, I need to get the target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m26s)

[type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m29s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m33s)

[from there, I think I just rip through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m35s)

[because I need the test class. Yeah. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m39s)

[this is this is I think I can replace](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m42s)

[mine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m45s)

[Uh, accelerate builds in Visual Studio.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m47s)

[Oh, thank you, Benjamin. Yeah, I'll I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m50s)

[make sure to add it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m52s)

[This is effectively the model I have for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m54s)

[tracking all of the data that I need.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h13m58s)

[And I think that's what I wanted to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m03s)

[validate inside of here is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m04s)

[this rips through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m09s)

[and builds up this hierarchy class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m12s)

[And this result class with a command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m18s)

[info is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m21s)

[effectively his metadata as well about](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m24s)

[what what do we actually need? And I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m27s)

[think in all of these cases, these are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m31s)

[either his own classes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m34s)

[or primitives. And that's the key thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m36s)

[with the incremental generators.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m39s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m45s)

[Command with errors because where is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m49s)

[this guy coming from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m51s)

[So it's coming out of here. Incremental](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m54s)

[values provider. So this is what needs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m56s)

[to go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h14m59s)

[So, I might be able to flatten this even](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m03s)

[further for mine. Like, we may end up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m05s)

[wanting this bit here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m08s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m12s)

[JDT Alivan, thank you for the follow. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m14s)

[appreciate it. I appreciate it. I am I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m17s)

[am muddy following through figuring out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m20s)

[incremental source generators. I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m25s)

[not written one yet and so I am](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m28s)

[blatantly digging through the community](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m31s)

[toolkits MVVM ones because these are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m34s)

[great and I want to make sure I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m36s)

[understand them.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m38s)

[Uh, Enigma PR merge didn't delete](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m42s)

[branches. Not sure if you're still using](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m45s)

[it. Oh, thank you, Izzy. Um, I'll I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m47s)

[torch it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m51s)

[If it's merged, there's nothing in there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m53s)

[that I need. though cuz all I have is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m55s)

[pushed. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m57s)

[uh, origin feature delete appang.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h15m59s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m04s)

[Okay. So, I think I do want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m08s)

[this function,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m11s)

[but I'm not going to be returning back.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m14s)

[I think I just need to change the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m17s)

[generic type because for me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m19s)

[the generic type that I have is the so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m26s)

[this s class is effectively](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m29s)

[all of my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m33s)

[native types and we can we can optimize](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m35s)

[some of these here too, right? Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m38s)

[simple like do you need to do this? No.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m41s)

[But this is there is a small performance](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m44s)

[gain with this. So, you know what? Might](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m46s)

[as well,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m48s)

[right? If you're not going to derive](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m50s)

[from it, these are just data classes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m51s)

[And some of these could be turned into](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m54s)

[records as well,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m55s)

[which we and I could probably go through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h16m58s)

[and make several of these immutable on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m01s)

[top of that. And we could add some extra](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m04s)

[stuff. But](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m06s)

[before getting too carried away,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m09s)

[let's go back here. And I think what I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m12s)

[want to do is up here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m15s)

[because result was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m19s)

[why don't I have result](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m23s)

[thought result was in that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m25s)

[where was result coming back from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m31s)

[is this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m35s)

[diagnostic errors. I think we probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m40s)

[want this class as well.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m43s)

[Open file floor. I'm going to steal this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m47s)

[guy. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m50s)

[he needs to land](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m54s)

[here. We haven't really broken stuff out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m57s)

[into name spaces. And we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h17m59s)

[adjust this here. And I need to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m01s)

[through and look at what I need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m03s)

[change on the licensing thing. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m05s)

[equatable array.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m07s)

[Wait, equatable array is Oh, and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m10s)

[diagnostic info. Oh, yuck, yuck, yuck,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m13s)

[yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m15s)

[yuck. Hold on. Do we actually want this?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m17s)

[Do we need it is the question. Do we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m21s)

[need it? Because this is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m25s)

[set class. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m29s)

[right. I think so.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m35s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m41s)

[we're going to do that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m47s)

[But what is this? What is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m50s)

[this extension method want that second](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m54s)

[generic to be?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h18m59s)

[wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m03s)

[This actually lives off.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m07s)

[Do I need this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m10s)

[for attributes with metadata? This now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m14s)

[exists down here. So, I may not need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m16s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m19s)

[I may not need this. Oh, this might make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m22s)

[it even easier.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m24s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m26s)

[for attributes with metadata.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m29s)

[Yeah. And so in my case, what I am after](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m33s)

[is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m35s)

[constructor test attributes. So it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m37s)

[going to look more akin to the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m40s)

[following.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m41s)

[And then it looks like this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m47s)

[While we're in here, seal that sucker](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m54s)

[up, too.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m56s)

[Uh there we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h19m59s)

[And then node is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m02s)

[class declaration syntax, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m11s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m15s)

[we're just going to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m18s)

[like that for now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m20s)

[as our filter. But this guy here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m23s)

[Is there a reason](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m31s)

[increment value provider](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m35s)

[because where is this where are these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m38s)

[diagnostics coming from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m39s)

[execute try get info that's what's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m44s)

[generating these diagnostics where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m47s)

[uh where because diagnostic info yeah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m53s)

[that's his own type where do you come](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h20m57s)

[from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m01s)

[where do you come from what actually is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m03s)

[generating a diagnostic](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m05s)

[builder to immutables where did builder](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m08s)

[come](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m11s)

[gets All for attributes. Don't stop in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m14s)

[case of an error. Just ignore ignore](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m16s)

[faulting attributes. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m19s)

[See, I don't know that I need all of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m28s)

[these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m30s)

[cuz I don't need to do the same stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m32s)

[So, we may not need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m38s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m42s)

[At least for the moment I don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m46s)

[that I need it at least.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m49s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m54s)

[yeah. So his diagnostic class is just a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m56s)

[simple wrapper over the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h21m59s)

[Oh no, this isn't this diagnostic is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m02s)

[Oh, this is the real diagnostic.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m08s)

[But this is the diagnostic info is his](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m11s)

[wrapper with the relevant bits in it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m15s)

[Yeah. Arguments syntax tree descriptor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m19s)

[blah blah blah blah blah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m22s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m25s)

[This is why once I get this done, I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m28s)

[going to put together a template with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m29s)

[all of this stuff in here because I feel](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m31s)

[like there's a bunch of these helpers](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m32s)

[that kind of just need to live](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m34s)

[everywhere. Okay. So I don't know that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m36s)

[we care. So we're going to go without](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m40s)

[until I understand the reason why I need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m43s)

[it. And then we're going to come back.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m44s)

[So has language at least equal to. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m47s)

[we're going to drop this and have this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m52s)

[be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m55s)

[just this for now.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h22m57s)

[All right. So we're going to go there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m01s)

[And then this is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m07s)

[new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m09s)

[subclass. This should get us to there,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m11s)

[right? Does that not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m15s)

[where item hierarchy](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m18s)

[where item](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m20s)

[is not null?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m22s)

[Does that not get me compiling there?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m25s)

[What is your problem here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m32s)

[Uh, let's see. Using the generic tag.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m36s)

[Oh, because I'm an idiot. That's not how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m39s)

[you declare generics. There we are.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m41s)

[Okay, so that's now working. Has](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m43s)

[language version at least. I don't think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m46s)

[I care about lang version. I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m49s)

[generating fairly old C sharp.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m51s)

[But even though I'm generating oldish](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h23m58s)

[car, how do how does this language check](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m01s)

[work?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m03s)

[Uh so it looks at the compilation and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m06s)

[checks lang version equal.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m09s)

[So let's do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m14s)

[So this effectively comes down to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m22s)

[uh a cast on this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m28s)

[If I take you,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m33s)

[put you up here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m36s)

[and bring you down onto here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m39s)

[Um and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m48s)

[uh lang version](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m52s)

[only cased appropriately lang version](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m55s)

[greater than or equal uh let's see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h24m59s)

[less than](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m03s)

[this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m06s)

[there's a problem okay so what's your](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m08s)

[problem here uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m10s)

[that is a not and that doesn't make](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m13s)

[sense okay](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m15s)

[show that gets me there. I don't know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m18s)

[that I care about C 8.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m21s)

[I don't use any of those. I think we can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m25s)

[go older.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m28s)

[C. Oh, wait a minute. This lang version](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m31s)

[enume is decorated with what was in each](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m34s)

[version.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m36s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m39s)

[Let's see what does our generated code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m45s)

[leverage.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m47s)

[We don't leverage any of this stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m53s)

[Oh, we might leverage string](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m57s)

[interpolation.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h25m58s)

[Think we leverage string interpolation.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m01s)

[And honestly, I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m03s)

[I think doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m07s)

[um less than C# 5 I I cannot imagine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m10s)

[anybody's updating a Nougat package and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m14s)

[targeting an older version.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m16s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m20s)

[so that gets me to there. That gets me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m22s)

[to here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m24s)

[You're basically talking to past Kevin.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m26s)

[100% correct, Hay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m28s)

[100%.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m31s)

[Um, okay. I don't think I want any of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m33s)

[this code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m37s)

[I think I don't want that. What I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m40s)

[down here is what we ended up doing with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m43s)

[the syntax stuff receiver down further.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m48s)

[So, the syntax receiver](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m54s)

[was doing all of this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h26m58s)

[So, I wanted uh Okay, let's let's talk](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m00s)

[you to the side for a second. Let's talk](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m04s)

[you to the side. Okay, so if we wanted a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m06s)

[class declaration syntax,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m10s)

[this was getting the name type symbol. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m13s)

[don't know if I care. And I wanted](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m15s)

[um let's see class declaration](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m19s)

[because I wanted to ensure that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m24s)

[it has an attribute matching mine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m27s)

[find attribute with metadata name. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m32s)

[think this is going to do most of what I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m35s)

[want though](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m37s)

[because it's going to limit it down and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m40s)

[find me things in the syntax tree that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m43s)

[have that attribute on there. I'm going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m46s)

[to filter here. I don't think I actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m49s)

[need to check](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m52s)

[I don't think I need to check for the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m57s)

[attribute because that's the whole point](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h27m59s)

[of what this is doing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m01s)

[is it's pulling it back. Well, we've got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m05s)

[tests. So, I don't think I actually need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m07s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m11s)

[Um, let's see here. So, what is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m13s)

[diagnostic here? Uh, must specify target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m15s)

[type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m19s)

[So this is looking at the data on the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m22s)

[because the the attribute usage in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m29s)

[question is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m31s)

[if we go back to our XUnit sample right](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m34s)

[of we are hunting out this attribute and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m37s)

[it's that diagnostic is verifying that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m40s)

[there's a target type specified because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m42s)

[not specifying one is an error. So we](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m44s)

[care a little bit about that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m47s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m51s)

[let me look because the relay command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m53s)

[one has things like can execute or](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h28m56s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m00s)

[try get info.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m02s)

[Where is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m04s)

[execute get syntax?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m08s)

[Where where does it pull off the can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m15s)

[execute bits?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m19s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m22s)

[does some stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m23s)

[field declaration. Yeah, this is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m29s)

[other thing I don't like about source](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m31s)

[generator stuff. You have to write stuff](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m32s)

[like this to get somewhat simplistic C](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m35s)

[to output, which makes me always feel](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m38s)

[yucky. Um can execute expression. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m41s)

[Can execute expression type. Where did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m45s)

[this guy come from? Where did you come](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m47s)

[from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m50s)

[I want to know where this constructor is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m51s)

[invoked from.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m55s)

[Uh return.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h29m57s)

[There there's there](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m01s)

[is the constructor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m09s)

[can execute. Where is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m12s)

[can execute expression type? Where did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m15s)

[you come from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m17s)

[Try get can execute expression type. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m19s)

[this is going from a method symbol and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m22s)

[my case I will have a so this is this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m23s)

[the equivalent right? So it's doing the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m27s)

[try get info.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m29s)

[So this is okay. So here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m31s)

[it casted it down to a method symbol. In](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m36s)

[my case, I'm going to cast it down to a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m39s)

[I class symbol. And this is try get info](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m43s)

[where it comes in here. Love the go-to.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m49s)

[Like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m54s)

[this stuff wasn't so bloody efficient. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m56s)

[would mock it, but](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h30m58s)

[it's well tested and clean, so it's hard](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m01s)

[to mock it too much. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m03s)

[try get can execute expression type. How](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m08s)

[do you work? So you take in the method](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m12s)

[symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m14s)

[and then on the attribute data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m16s)

[try get named argument](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m20s)

[pulls that out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m23s)

[gets the can execute me member if any.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m26s)

[So we basically need to do the same](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m28s)

[thing. We need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m30s)

[where did it get the attribute data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m35s)

[from? So we need to get our symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m37s)

[attribute data. Where did attribute data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m39s)

[come in from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m41s)

[Attribute data came from further up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m43s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m45s)

[Context.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m48s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m50s)

[okay. So context attributes.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h31m56s)

[I think given the given the method I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m02s)

[don't think it's possible to have two](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m07s)

[but we'll check we'll check I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m08s)

[context attribute subzero is safe in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m10s)

[this case.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m13s)

[Um, so](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m15s)

[var let's see constructor test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m18s)

[attribute is going to be that. All](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m23s)

[right. So that's that's going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m25s)

[there. And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m26s)

[from here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m29s)

[we want to go back to the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m31s)

[try get can execute. Right? So, we want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m35s)

[to effectively do something like this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m38s)

[because we need to pull that little bit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m42s)

[back out.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m45s)

[And instead of can execute in my case, I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m47s)

[want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m52s)

[uh target type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m54s)

[I am curious.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h32m57s)

[Oh, try get named argu. Oh, is that his](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m01s)

[own method? He's got so many helpers. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m03s)

[many helpers.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m06s)

[Um, let's see. It is his own helper. Try](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m08s)

[get named arguments. So, it's ripping](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m12s)

[through the attribute data, looking for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m14s)

[the named arguments where it matches and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m16s)

[then pulling that out accordingly.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m19s)

[Um, rather than named arguments, is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m24s)

[there just because I have both.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m26s)

[There's also constructor arguments.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m29s)

[So, I'm going to need to search for both](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m33s)

[to know which one mine is because my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m36s)

[attribute in in his case, his relay](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m39s)

[command, the only there isn't an](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m41s)

[overload on the attributes constructor.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m43s)

[Mine](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m48s)

[um has both a constructor that takes the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m50s)

[target type in or allows you to specify](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m53s)

[it here. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h33m58s)

[the oh I guess I closed it. So rather](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m00s)

[than specifying it of this nature](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m04s)

[alternate syntax is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m07s)

[this right? So that's the other way of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m11s)

[doing it. And so I need to not just hunt](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m14s)

[name types but I need to hunt](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m17s)

[constructor arguments.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m19s)

[And I need to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m22s)

[check](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m26s)

[which I am in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m29s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m31s)

[this is where I think I want to take](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m35s)

[that syntax receiver code and start](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m37s)

[breaking it aart](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m40s)

[into something different because this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m42s)

[where separating this stuff out is going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m46s)

[to matter.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m49s)

[But I think I I'm going to just keep](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m52s)

[everything right here for now and then I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m53s)

[will break it into different classes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m56s)

[later. Uh, private](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h34m58s)

[uh static](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m05s)

[type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m06s)

[I don't know. I don't know what the I I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m09s)

[don't think type is the right one. Get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m10s)

[uh target set type. We're going to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m13s)

[that for the moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m17s)

[And then it's going to take in is it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m19s)

[attribute data? Yeah,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m22s)

[attribute data. uh instructor tests](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m25s)

[attribute,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m31s)

[right? And so we are going to just yank](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m32s)

[this little bit out. We're going to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m35s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m38s)

[if and then I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m47s)

[is I think I want to start by iterating](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m50s)

[the constructor arcs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m52s)

[and see if I find it there and if I if I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m54s)

[find it there I can stop](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h35m58s)

[and if I don't find it there then I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m02s)

[to go after name args](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m03s)

[Um, yeah, that's completely wrong. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m06s)

[let's go with this arg. What do we have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m09s)

[on arg?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m11s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m13s)

[value type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m16s)

[Okay, so that checks the type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m21s)

[for to display string.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m25s)

[I don't know that that's the best way to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m29s)

[check.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m31s)

[How does he do type checking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m34s)

[or does he just skip type checking?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m38s)

[Uh, let's see. Pulls it back.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m44s)

[Get named argument.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m48s)

[Um, try get named argument](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m52s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m57s)

[containing type get all members](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h36m59s)

[to immutable array.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m02s)

[I'm looking to see where the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m05s)

[ooh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m12s)

[I type symbol is not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m14s)

[special type. Oh, is there a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m17s)

[ah the built-in happiness?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m21s)

[Is there a special type for system type?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m26s)

[Because that would be really really](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m29s)

[convenient](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m32s)

[if there was a system type in this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m34s)

[object enume delegate value type void.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m37s)

[It's got all the primitives. It's got](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m41s)

[array](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m44s)

[innumerable generic innumerable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m46s)

[nullable disposable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m50s)

[type reference.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m53s)

[That's not it. I don't think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h37m57s)

[indicates the type is a runtime type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m04s)

[handle. I'm trying to think if there are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m06s)

[any](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m08s)

[arguments inside of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m12s)

[the MVVM community toolkit where it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m16s)

[using a system type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m19s)

[I don't because I I do wonder if if](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m23s)

[system type reference is the right way](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m27s)

[to check this. Let me just check. Are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m30s)

[there any references in here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m33s)

[No, there are no references to that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m37s)

[specific one.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m40s)

[Let me check this one. I don't think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m44s)

[runtime type handle is going to have one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m45s)

[either. Okay, so let me do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m47s)

[System.t type. I don't think I'm going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m51s)

[to find any hits here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h38m53s)

[Get nest to type. No, those are all just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m03s)

[in there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m05s)

[Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m08s)

[Cuz I that's really what I want to see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m11s)

[is where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m13s)

[has qu has fully qualified name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m19s)

[I think that's the better check.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m26s)

[Is this his? Of course it is two display](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m31s)

[string full of qualified name format.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m35s)

[I think this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m44s)

[let's see gets the fully qualified name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m51s)

[for a given symbol including nullability](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m53s)

[annotations.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m55s)

[That'll be good to know.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h39m57s)

[Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m00s)

[Has I'm just looking at what extra](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m04s)

[things he's got in here cuz he's got a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m06s)

[lot of useful stuff. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m08s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m12s)

[what we actually want to do instead](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m13s)

[is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m16s)

[this has fully qualified name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m19s)

[Oh, wait. Uh, but has fully qualified](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m23s)

[name was the extension method. Duh. Duh.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m25s)

[um has fully qualified name is just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m30s)

[calling to display string and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m32s)

[equaling the type. So just to flat again](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m36s)

[some of these we may flatten out better](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m40s)

[later we're going to we're going to get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m41s)

[make it work make it right then make it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m44s)

[fast.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m46s)

[Okay so we're going to go like that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m48s)

[is named type symbol. I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m53s)

[care about it being a named type symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h40m56s)

[Why do I care about that copilot?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m00s)

[Oh, because to display string probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m04s)

[had has a requirement on that I symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m07s)

[there. Don't need a name type. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m15s)

[and this is doing type getit type. But](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m20s)

[we don't actually like, and this is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m22s)

[key thing is I don't actually want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m24s)

[this. I only need enough like it it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m26s)

[generated this because I set my return](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m30s)

[type here. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m32s)

[because this is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m38s)

[constructor argument.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m40s)

[Um, and what does my s class actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m44s)

[need? Because I think I just need the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m48s)

[parameter name and its fully qualified](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m50s)

[type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m53s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m55s)

[because all I really care about is name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h41m58s)

[and full name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m00s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m05s)

[I just need that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m07s)

[Uh so this actually should be set class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m11s)

[There's that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m19s)

[So if I have this, I can go return new](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m22s)

[and then name is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m32s)

[uh let's see target type symbol to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m34s)

[display string](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m38s)

[and then I want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m40s)

[the symbol display format of I I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m43s)

[want the full name. I just want the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m46s)

[simple name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m48s)

[Uh let's see because that's full name. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m50s)

[guess we can just do full name there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m53s)

[Fully qualified format, right? And then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m56s)

[we can do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h42m58s)

[name. It's target type symbol to display](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m00s)

[string.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m04s)

[Um oh wait, was there two minimal](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m07s)

[display string?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m10s)

[It's probably what I want.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m13s)

[What does two minimal display string](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m16s)

[return?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m17s)

[Um, too minimal display string converts](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m20s)

[a symbol to a string that can be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m23s)

[displayed to the user may be tailored to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m24s)

[a specific location in source code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m27s)

[I don't so I think I use name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m36s)

[I think I use name for building up a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m40s)

[test method name if I remember right.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m42s)

[Yeah. So it gets used as part of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m46s)

[unit test method name. So I think I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m48s)

[actually want to go back to to display](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m51s)

[string I think.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m54s)

[Uh symbol display format](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h43m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m02s)

[feel like this is going to get me](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m06s)

[feel like this is going to get me right](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m10s)

[back to the same thing. But maybe that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m11s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m12s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m15s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m20s)

[two display parts.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m23s)

[What is the difference here? What is two](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m30s)

[display parts do? Because I think it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m32s)

[breaks it apart. Converts a symbol into](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m35s)

[array of string parts. Each of which has](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m36s)

[a kind useful for colorizing. Oh, look](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m39s)

[at that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m42s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m44s)

[uh let's see. Can we just do where?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m49s)

[Do where x do.ind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m54s)

[equals class name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h44m57s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m01s)

[Struck name is never going to be a thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m03s)

[because we don't generate code valid for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m06s)

[that. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m08s)

[and then I want last, I think,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m14s)

[there. Something like that. That will](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m20s)

[probably get me where I want to go. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m22s)

[and then we're going to make this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m26s)

[nullable.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m27s)

[Okay. And then the very end of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m28s)

[method is going to be return null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m31s)

[And then we need the optional case where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m33s)

[if we didn't find it in the constructor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m36s)

[arguments.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m39s)

[See Izzy, have a good one. Looking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m41s)

[forward to next week. Uh I can't deal](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m44s)

[with less than four screens. Hey, I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m47s)

[only on three right now, so you know,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m49s)

[but have a good one. I would tell you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m52s)

[not to overwork yourself, but I I know](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m54s)

[better than that. Uh let's see. So for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m56s)

[each var](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h45m59s)

[in constructor test attributes named](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m01s)

[arguments.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m04s)

[Um okay. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m06s)

[uh let's see here. So we can probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m10s)

[break this into a local function because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m13s)

[this is going to end up being the exact](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m16s)

[same thing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m18s)

[Yeah, I think so because both of these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m22s)

[are iterating over](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m24s)

[one is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m27s)

[immutable key value pair string type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m32s)

[constant](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m35s)

[typed constant. So I can probably just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m37s)

[do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m40s)

[because this arg is just the type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m42s)

[constant, right? Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m44s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m48s)

[let's see. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m53s)

[what do I want? Static pool](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h46m55s)

[uh try get uh set class something like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m00s)

[that typed constant](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m04s)

[uh arg just to make things simple.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m09s)

[Thank you copilot. Um, and then I need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m15s)

[out set class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m19s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m24s)

[found class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m28s)

[We're going to do something like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m30s)

[found class gets that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m33s)

[uh return true.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m37s)

[Uh, found class gets null.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m40s)

[turn false.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m45s)

[I guess we could actually we don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m49s)

[really need a try pass. We could just do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m51s)

[we could just do this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m54s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h47m57s)

[we do this and then I guess we just go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m04s)

[basically back where we were. This is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m06s)

[probably not bad because then that means](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m09s)

[this logic comes down here. If get set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m12s)

[class arg is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m17s)

[return I think we do this as our null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m21s)

[check instead right that goes away now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m24s)

[and then this comes down here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m29s)

[and this becomes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m32s)

[we get rid of that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m35s)

[and then we do that and then we get rid](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m40s)

[of all of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m42s)

[Um, and it's going to be argal in this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m45s)

[case.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m48s)

[And there, now we've collapsed that. And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m52s)

[that feels better. Okay. So now we've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m54s)

[got a little a little guy here who given](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h48m56s)

[a constructor test argument can get us a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m00s)

[test class. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m02s)

[subclass](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m07s)

[subclass gets](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m09s)

[get target sub type uh constructor test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m13s)

[attribute. Okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m17s)

[And](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m20s)

[I think we do if set class is null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m22s)

[return default because that's one of the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m26s)

[things with these incremental generators](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m27s)

[the earlier you can exit the better.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m29s)

[So if you can if you can bail fast, do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m32s)

[so immediately.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m35s)

[Okay. So now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m38s)

[we need to finish parsing out the stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m42s)

[If we find it, I guess maybe I should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m47s)

[look at this. What does our syntax](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m49s)

[receiver do to get the rest of this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m51s)

[data? Um, so once it's found a target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m52s)

[type, we should we probably need to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m57s)

[diagnostics,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h49m59s)

[right? So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m01s)

[we're going to go here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m04s)

[Uh, and I'm just going to todo.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m06s)

[Uh, maybe I'll come down here and do it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m12s)

[down here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m15s)

[Uh, todo diagnostics.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m16s)

[So, we'll we'll we'll plug this in. I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m21s)

[leave myself a note so I don't forget](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m24s)

[about it and then I'll forget about it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m25s)

[later. Yeah, you found code in similar](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m27s)

[repositories. What a shock.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m29s)

[Are they mine?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m31s)

[Um, because if they are, I don't care.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m33s)

[Copilot.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m36s)

[No, we're not simplifying that. Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m38s)

[okay. So, it checks that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m40s)

[skip nullable parameters.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m42s)

[Uh, let's see here. This is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m48s)

[looking to see](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m54s)

[the constructor attribute has a behavior](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h50m59s)

[on it and it wants to know if this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m04s)

[set to ignore nullable par. So it wants](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m07s)

[to know if the behavior is ignore](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m11s)

[nullable parameters.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m13s)

[So, we need to we'll need to get that at](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m16s)

[some point.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m20s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m22s)

[I don't know that I care at the moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m24s)

[I'm more interested in figuring out how](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m26s)

[to build the rest of this stuff.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m27s)

[Uh, let's see. Class class is partial.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m30s)

[So, we need to know if it's a partial](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m35s)

[class or not. And I think the community](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m37s)

[toolkit does this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m40s)

[Um, let's go back. Where is the partial](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m43s)

[check? Cuz I'm I'm fairly confident I've](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m46s)

[seen this thing flag me when I failed to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m50s)

[make things partial. So, I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m52s)

[confident it does something in here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m55s)

[Uh, let's see. Relay command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h51m58s)

[um from containing type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m02s)

[Um, the only diagnostics have to come](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m08s)

[from here. So, it's got to be in here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m10s)

[somewhere.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m12s)

[Um, is command definition unique?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m13s)

[Generate field and property names. Try](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m19s)

[get map types from method.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m22s)

[Command types. command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m26s)

[command class type. So I have to believe](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m43s)

[this guy here does the partial.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m45s)

[I think there's got to be a check in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m49s)

[here somewhere.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m51s)

[Parameters return type. Where is it?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m53s)

[because this has the class type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h52m56s)

[This is not I'm looking at the wrong](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m03s)

[thing because this is specifically](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m05s)

[mapping because the relay command one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m09s)

[has different types that will work for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m11s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m13s)

[Async relay command. Relay command.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m15s)

[Yeah. So, it's it's just dealing with](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m18s)

[those.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m21s)

[That's not what I'm after. I want to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m23s)

[know about the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m26s)

[the method symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m29s)

[Do you do it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m32s)

[containing type multiple relay commands](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m41s)

[overload? So this is adding in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m45s)

[diagnostics. Okay, so you do have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m47s)

[diagnostics in here. Check for dup.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m49s)

[Okay, if there's a duplicate present,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m53s)

[there is no need to check for order.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m55s)

[Blah blah blah. Type down check has to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m56s)

[be done for check for duplicates the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h53m59s)

[containing type for the annotated](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m01s)

[method.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m02s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m04s)

[two method symbols are partial and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m10s)

[either implemented.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m12s)

[There's got to be a check in here for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m15s)

[partial.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m16s)

[Or maybe they just generate and let and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m19s)

[don't bother](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m23s)

[if the method is a partial definition](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m28s)

[also gather attributes from the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m30s)

[implementation part.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m32s)

[So they check if the method is partial](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m35s)

[but that's the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m42s)

[but that's it. So they don't bother to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m47s)

[check if the class is partial. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m49s)

[maybe we'll just generate and let the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m52s)

[compiler yell.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m54s)

[So we may not care. Okay. So let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h54m57s)

[Test class name. We already got that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m00s)

[Uh namespace declaration blah blah blah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m04s)

[Oh, so we were do min minimally](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m11s)

[qualified format before and fully](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m12s)

[qualified format. Great. Okay. Great.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m14s)

[Great. Great. Great. Great. Great,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m16s)

[great, great, great. Okay. And then this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m17s)

[is the code.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m20s)

[This is the code that is generating up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m26s)

[um generator target class. What is this?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m33s)

[Why do I have this?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m36s)

[Oh, so I actually probably need one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m41s)

[level up. So I need this bit of code. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m42s)

[need this bit of code. This is actually](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m45s)

[probably what I want.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m47s)

[Oops. Probably didn't want to close](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m50s)

[that. Oops. Oh well. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m52s)

[So, this is the next bit of stuff that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h55m58s)

[we needed to do.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m02s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m04s)

[uh, context attributes, but we know in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m06s)

[this case the context is going to be a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m10s)

[class definition.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m11s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m13s)

[I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m16s)

[cuz the their root level one was an I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m20s)

[method info something something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m23s)

[something something something something.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m25s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m27s)

[right I method symbol because it was](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m31s)

[context target symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m34s)

[and there has got to be a class symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m36s)

[something or another in here. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m39s)

[class symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m45s)

[What is the What is the derived I symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m47s)

[thing? That's a class](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m49s)

[I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m52s)

[uh I array I event.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h56m58s)

[Oh, named type symbol is probably what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m03s)

[we're after.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m07s)

[glass symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m09s)

[Yeah. So, it's going to be something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m12s)

[akin to that, I believe.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m13s)

[So, that'll get me to there. And I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m18s)

[need this yet. So, let's not do it until](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m21s)

[we need it. Cuz if we can early exit,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m24s)

[early exit's good. We're going to go](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m26s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m29s)

[And do you have constructors? Yeah.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m31s)

[Name type symbol has constructors. Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m35s)

[that gives me a lot of confidence that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m36s)

[we're in the right place. This guy comes](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m38s)

[in here. We build up parameters](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m40s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m45s)

[I name this guy s. My old code just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m48s)

[works](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m51s)

[for the moment. So, we'll do that for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m52s)

[the moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m54s)

[This builds that up. That builds that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m57s)

[up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h57m59s)

[And then I just need this. And then I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m01s)

[actually want this to be generated](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m05s)

[target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m08s)

[class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m11s)

[And then what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m13s)

[turn there. We should probably bring](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m18s)

[this guy up.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m21s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m24s)

[I don't know how how often I should be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m26s)

[checking this token.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m28s)

[Feels like I probably do something like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m32s)

[that maybe.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m34s)

[Um, and then I think the key is checking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m38s)

[it right before the return is the last](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m41s)

[one that you want to have to make sure](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m44s)

[that you've actually gotten everything.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m47s)

[Okay, so now I just need to get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m49s)

[that gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m53s)

[So I need the rest of these to make this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h58m56s)

[work. So I need namespace.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m00s)

[What was my syntax receiver doing for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m04s)

[namespace before?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m07s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m12s)

[namespace declaration. Where were you](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m13s)

[coming from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m15s)

[Containing namespace to display strings.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m17s)

[So that seems pretty simple and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m19s)

[straightforward.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m21s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m23s)

[uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m29s)

[I don't want to use symbol here, but I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m35s)

[do want to do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m38s)

[class symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m40s)

[there. That's at least feature parody](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m46s)

[for where I was before. Why do I have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m49s)

[the class name in two places?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m51s)

[Why did I do that?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m55s)

[Test class name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=03h59m58s)

[Oh, cuz one of these is the target type](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m04s)

[and this is the test class.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m06s)

[So this is the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m11s)

[Okay, so I may be getting my own code](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m18s)

[confused. So I need test class name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m19s)

[down here as well.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m26s)

[What](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m30s)

[syntax receiver? I need this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m34s)

[um test class name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m39s)

[and this is the class symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m42s)

[Okay. Oh, and this is actually wrong](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m47s)

[because this is not right. I don't want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m51s)

[this is the symbol. This is the unit](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m55s)

[test class that has the constructor test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h00m57s)

[attribute on top of it. Not the target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m00s)

[type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m02s)

[This guy is the one that has the target](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m05s)

[type. So I need to get that back, not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m07s)

[just as a s class. I need the actual](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m11s)

[thingy that goes with it. And that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m15s)

[what I want to iterate here. So down](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m18s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m21s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m28s)

[so I think what I want to do is this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m31s)

[and this. And then I want to get rid of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m35s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m39s)

[or at least I'm going to cut it and put](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m42s)

[it up above for the moment because I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m44s)

[going to need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m46s)

[I need something in this vicinity.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m47s)

[Um, not exactly the same, but something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m51s)

[close.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m54s)

[So, I want this to actually be this guy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h01m55s)

[Return target type symbol because I'm](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m01s)

[going to need the symbol for whatever](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m04s)

[that target type is, which is fine. It's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m06s)

[what I want.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m09s)

[This is going to be I symbol](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m19s)

[we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m22s)

[intentionally rename this so that it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m23s)

[breaks compilation down below. Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m25s)

[because this is where we want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m28s)

[actually I think what we want is named](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m34s)

[type symbol out of this instead](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m36s)

[because that's what has the constructor](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m39s)

[on it. So we want to catch that there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m41s)

[We catch that there. Catch that there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m44s)

[That flows up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m48s)

[sype.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m51s)

[Um, this is going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m53s)

[sype.constructors.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h02m56s)

[Um, and I'm going to rename this so I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m00s)

[make more sense of it. Test class](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m02s)

[symbol.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m05s)

[Uh, so this is this is different. We are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m07s)

[going to need you, but we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m10s)

[need you down here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m11s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m15s)

[I don't know why did I do original](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m18s)

[definition.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m19s)

[So dry for say type substitution. This](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m22s)

[gets the original symbol as was defined](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m24s)

[in the source and metadata. Interesting.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m26s)

[I'm going to leave it because that's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m29s)

[what it was, but I'm not confident](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m30s)

[that's right. Uh bum. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m32s)

[Constructor.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m35s)

[So this gets me my system under test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m36s)

[target type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m39s)

[Iterate through the constructors, builds](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m41s)

[up my parameters.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m43s)

[This guy here is a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m53s)

[set class set gets new.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m55s)

[And this is where we're going to need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h03m59s)

[this bit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m02s)

[Um and I think I can probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m06s)

[steal from wherever I built it up](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m10s)

[before. S type.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m12s)

[This is what we were doing before. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m16s)

[we're going to just steal that again.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m19s)

[And that now works. Matches this. Builds](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m23s)

[that up. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m27s)

[That gets me a lot closer. Rips through](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m30s)

[there. Takes that. And then we rather](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m33s)

[than building up a collection like what](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m36s)

[we were doing before,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m38s)

[we are](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m40s)

[just going to return it. We probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m43s)

[need to add in that diagnostics check.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m46s)

[We need to know if we skip nullable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m50s)

[parameters. So that's the other thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m53s)

[that we had in here. So this is checking](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h04m55s)

[let's see argument list.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m03s)

[This is interesting because I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m10s)

[think we get the argument list.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m11s)

[I don't think we get the argument list,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m17s)

[but let's look. Uh, constructor test](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m18s)

[argument are. Yeah. So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m21s)

[have to go through constructor arguments](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m24s)

[and named arguments. There's not a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m25s)

[argument list. It doesn't look like.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m28s)

[Yeah, that's fine. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m32s)

[So, let's just wrap that up in a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m34s)

[function. I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m38s)

[um yeah, we're going to just going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m43s)

[steal that code and bring it down here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m46s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m51s)

[get skip nullable parameters and we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m53s)

[going to change you to be attribute data](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h05m55s)

[and then we're going to rename you to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m00s)

[here. Rename you to here. Okay. And so I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m01s)

[think we're going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m05s)

[something very similar to what we did](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m07s)

[here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m09s)

[where it's going to look a lot like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m11s)

[this. And again, we can wrap this up in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m12s)

[helpers in a bit. Make it work, make it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m16s)

[right, make it fast.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m18s)

[And in this case, what we are after is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m20s)

[on the attribute, we want to know if the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m24s)

[type is this enume. So we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m27s)

[start there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m34s)

[gonna go there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m38s)

[Then we're going to grab](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m41s)

[type name.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m44s)

[There we go. So if the type is our enume](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m56s)

[I don't know if this check on the other](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h06m59s)

[one is going to be right.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m01s)

[We'll have to debug and find out. I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m05s)

[think that's going to actually be wrong](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m06s)

[because it's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m11s)

[Yeah, we'll have to look. I not](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m13s)

[confident. So, get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m15s)

[uh uh let's just call this get behavior.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m20s)

[Hey, that's what caps lock looks like.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m27s)

[get behavior](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m30s)

[and then we're going to drop you into](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m32s)

[both cases here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m34s)

[and here. And the name of that is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m37s)

[behavior. And you know, there's a reason](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m42s)

[we're not doing a name of is we don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m43s)

[want hard references between these two.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m45s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m48s)

[generation is actually a good thing.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m50s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m54s)

[we may end up declaring some constants](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m57s)

[or similar if we use if we use these](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h07m58s)

[strings in multiple places. I'll I'll](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m00s)

[declare them. Um let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m02s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m08s)

[is skip](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m13s)

[nable](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m18s)

[parameter.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m20s)

[Do this. Do this. So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m22s)

[rename that function](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m25s)

[get](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m27s)

[skip. Uh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m33s)

[yeah, whatever. We'll leave it like that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m36s)

[for now.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m37s)

[And then this guy is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m39s)

[nullable.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m46s)

[And then we want the default behavior to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m50s)

[be default I believe.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m53s)

[So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m56s)

[skip nullable is going to be false.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h08m58s)

[Second](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m02s)

[uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m12s)

[Oh, I guess that one got blocked by my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m22s)

[automation. So, yay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m24s)

[Um, okay. So, this guy here is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m27s)

[if the type is there.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m32s)

[Uh, I don't know what this is going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m37s)

[be.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m39s)

[I I'm trying to think if there's a a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m41s)

[sample similar where I can](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m44s)

[look. Let me go look at the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m47s)

[relay command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m54s)

[attribute. Is there an ENU member on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m56s)

[here at all?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h09m59s)

[I don't know that there's any](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m02s)

[attributes I can think of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m04s)

[that has](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m09s)

[notify property change attribute. Do any](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m12s)

[of these things have](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m14s)

[enumes on them?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m16s)

[I don't know that they do.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m19s)

[Specifically, enume properties.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m23s)

[Yeah, they don't have properties on](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m35s)

[them.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m39s)

[Okay. So, that might be an interesting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m41s)

[one to solve.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m44s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m46s)

[we're just going to return true for now](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m52s)

[and put it to-do do check enum value.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m54s)

[That needs to be a thing. And then this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h10m59s)

[is going to be a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m02s)

[turn false](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m05s)

[because that's the default. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m08s)

[So, we have this. We come back up here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m11s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m16s)

[Something like that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m19s)

[Uh, let's see. A static anonymous](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m23s)

[function. Mine should be static as well.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m26s)

[Problem solved.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m30s)

[Okay. Skip nullable ones. Okay. So, that](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m32s)

[gets me all the way through here. What](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m35s)

[is your problem?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m37s)

[uh cannot be inferred by usage. Try](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m44s)

[special.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m47s)

[Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m49s)

[let me help you. That's the type I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m52s)

[expect.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m54s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h11m57s)

[so, what is the right return type then](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m00s)

[for these?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m04s)

[This thing was returning default.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m11s)

[Where is the difference here?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m16s)

[That's returning. Oh, is it because this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m25s)

[thing wants a value type? Is that the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m27s)

[difference?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m31s)

[Uh values](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m34s)

[incremental generator node.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m38s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m50s)

[confused why this thing is unhappy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m53s)

[Is it can you not figure it out from](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h12m59s)

[there?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m01s)

[possible null reference return. Oh,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m08s)

[it doesn't want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m10s)

[Got it. It doesn't want](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m15s)

[a null. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m18s)

[Got it. Public static uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m20s)

[generator target class. We're just going](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m25s)

[to we're going to just cheapo mode this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m27s)

[for the moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m30s)

[probably won't keep this,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m32s)

[but because the because this is mutable,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m35s)

[there's too many ways this goes poorly.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m38s)

[But for now,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m40s)

[uh we're going to do this, which is why](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m43s)

[it's unhappy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m46s)

[So, that should make it happy.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m48s)

[That should make that happy. Okay,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m53s)

[figure it out now. You happier now?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m56s)

[Okay, so he got away with the default](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h13m58s)

[keyword because he was using a value](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m01s)

[tuple. We are not.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m03s)

[We should](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m05s)

[um we may go bringing those in.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m11s)

[Command info get the filtered sequence](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m16s)

[to enable caching.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m19s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m23s)

[this is the same thing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m32s)

[cuz what is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m38s)

[cuz okay hold on I want to look at the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m41s)

[two types here. So what's the difference](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m43s)

[here? So incremental values provider](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m45s)

[value tupil hierarchy result command](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m48s)

[info.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m51s)

[This is grabbing](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m55s)

[where the command info is nonnull.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h14m57s)

[because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m12s)

[info is the command.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m14s)

[So finding where we actually have a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m19s)

[command info versus having a null one](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m21s)

[with diagnostics.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m24s)

[Okay, I don't know that I need this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m30s)

[either on mine, at least not yet.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m33s)

[This will probably go along with the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m36s)

[heirs, but I I think what I do instead.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m38s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m44s)

[and actually, no, we we can do we can do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m46s)

[the same thing. I don't need to get rid](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m49s)

[of this because I do I do because I just](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m50s)

[added the the empty case. I do have I do](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m52s)

[have a concept of this already, right?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m56s)

[So it's in my case it's going to be this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h15m59s)

[but it's going to be where uh item set](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m03s)

[class](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m07s)

[right um or s is not null right because](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m09s)

[I didn't find one so we're going to cut](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m12s)

[those in](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m14s)

[and then here](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m17s)

[we need to get the declaration syntax](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m20s)

[and this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m25s)

[a I think we still want a member](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m30s)

[declaration syntax cuz in his case he's](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m32s)

[declaring](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m35s)

[uh the relevant like uh properties and](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m38s)

[otherwise but that's going to be fine.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m42s)

[Uh file name hint.g.cs CS](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m47s)

[and I believe in my case](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m54s)

[mine were being labeled as](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h16m58s)

[because if I look at what these things](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m02s)

[were generating before](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m04s)

[it's actually testname.g.cs.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m07s)

[So in my case](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m10s)

[item here is my](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m14s)

[um so it's not going to be file name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m17s)

[hint mine is going to be test class name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m19s)

[and then I don't need method name](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m25s)

[hereg.cs](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m26s)

[cuz I'm I put all mine in the same](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m29s)

[individual one. What's compilation unit?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m32s)

[Oh, that's here. So](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m35s)

[um his hierarchy has a get compilation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m38s)

[unit.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m42s)

[What does that do?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m44s)

[Uh let's see here. Takes in the member](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m50s)

[declarations](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m53s)

[uh creates a parallel type B uh](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m56s)

[declaration with the given member](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h17m59s)

[declarations that declares as false.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m00s)

[type kind](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m04s)

[name members. So, this is just building](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m05s)

[up all of that, which we're going to](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m08s)

[want to do something kind of similar,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m11s)

[I think.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m15s)

[I think we're going to want something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m17s)

[somewhat similarish to this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m19s)

[Um, but not quite the same, I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m24s)

[think. We're going to Let's strip this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m28s)

[for the moment.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m30s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m34s)

[but I don't think I want it exactly](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m36s)

[this. But this is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m40s)

[Yeah. Get compilation](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m45s)

[cuz wait, how does that thing reference?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m48s)

[Where does hierarchy come from?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m54s)

[Where where are you coming from? Where](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h18m58s)

[are you declared?](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m00s)

[Oh, this is the other partial of the So,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m03s)

[this is actually on the hierarchy info.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m06s)

[Got it. Um, because this actually has](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m11s)

[the type info and the get syntax and all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m15s)

[of that stuff to go along with it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m18s)

[Okay. Okay. So, we will need something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m22s)

[similarish because I think I've dropped](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m27s)

[I have dropped enough of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m31s)

[I've dropped enough of that data, but I](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m35s)

[will need I will need something similar](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m42s)

[in here because my item doesn't have all](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m44s)

[of the stuff. And then we will need](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m48s)

[um something of private static](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m52s)

[mutable array](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h19m58s)

[member declaration syntax](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m00s)

[uh get members.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m04s)

[We're going to do something about like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m07s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m09s)

[And it's going to look something like](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m10s)

[this. And it's going to go something](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m12s)

[like this. And it's going to be](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m14s)

[item dot](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m18s)

[uh probably](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m24s)

[s because it doesn't care about anything](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m27s)

[else.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m29s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m31s)

[see return](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m34s)

[mutable array](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m37s)

[member declaration syntax. I think](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m42s)

[there's just an empty here. Yeah, we're](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m45s)

[going to do that.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m47s)

[Uh let's see. In this case, we can null](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m50s)

[bang because we null checked it here.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m53s)

[And then to get the compilation unit,](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m56s)

[we're going to need to clean some of](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h20m58s)

[this stuff up. But it is 1:00 a.m. for](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m00s)

[me. And I think what I'm going to do is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m02s)

[I am going to commit this so I don't](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m05s)

[lose any of it.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m08s)

[Uh we're going to just go with starting](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m10s)

[work on re doing the](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m13s)

[source generators.](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m18s)

[And I think we will circle back to this](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m21s)

[at a later point or I may I I may poke](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m25s)

[at this as well. So, we will see how it](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m28s)

[goes. The good news that was about half](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m31s)

[a Mountain Dew, so that that worked out](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m33s)

[pretty well. Um, for anybody who stuck](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m35s)

[all the way around, just going to plug a](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m38s)

[few things one more time. Uh,net comp is](https://youtu.be/mlXBHQkEb5A?t=04h21m40s)
