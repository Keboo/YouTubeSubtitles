[okay everyone welcome back](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m03s)

[um so tonight i thought i would do um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m05s)

[something a little bit uh different i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m08s)

[there had been a request i had gotten](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m10s)

[for doing um like off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m12s)

[sorry visual studio would like to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m15s)

[install an update there's no way this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m17s)

[going to go poorly uh so i got a request](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m18s)

[to do uh authentication and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m20s)

[authorization inside of a wpf app and i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m22s)

[i started looking at doing that and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m25s)

[quickly realized](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m27s)

[there's a few other concepts that kind](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m28s)

[of need to be covered um before getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m30s)

[all the way into that most specifically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m32s)

[configuration and secret management](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m34s)

[which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m36s)

[is oftentimes quite problematic for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m37s)

[thick client apps like wpf it's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m40s)

[trivial when you have something that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m42s)

[contains say a client secret or a client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m44s)

[to d where do you put that how do you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m46s)

[share that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m48s)

[and put it out securely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m49s)

[one thing i'm going to say just straight](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m51s)

[up front](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m53s)

[when possible avoid putting anything](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m55s)

[in your wpf app that you don't want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h00m59s)

[someone to have access to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m01s)

[effectively once you put the code on a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m03s)

[your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m06s)

[your user's machine you've lost control](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m06s)

[of it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m09s)

[there's nothing stopping them from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m10s)

[breaking it apart there are things like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m11s)

[off you skaters that you can apply to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m13s)

[your code to make it harder but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m14s)

[nothing's impossible um all you do is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m16s)

[slow them down make it not worth it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m19s)

[quite often um the best solution is to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m20s)

[put all of your uh proprietary stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m23s)

[that you don't want somebody to see not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m26s)

[in the app but somewhere else put it on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m27s)

[a web service or similar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m29s)

[and just don't put it on the machine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m32s)

[because like i've demonstrated on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m33s)

[previous streams with like snoop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m35s)

[somebody could just go on and turn those](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m37s)

[ui elements on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m38s)

[you haven't really blocked them if all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m40s)

[you're doing is controlling local bits](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m42s)

[somebody could always get by it and you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m44s)

[have to keep that in mind when you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m45s)

[writing your code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m47s)

[so but with that i wanted to look at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m48s)

[eye configuration setup inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m50s)

[c-sharp so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m53s)

[this is something that web developers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m54s)

[are probably very familiar with um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m56s)

[asp.net core when it came out microsoft](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h01m58s)

[added in this great configuration thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m01s)

[um and a lot of people kind of assume](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m03s)

[that oh that's just asp.net core well no](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m06s)

[it's not actually specific you can use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m08s)

[it anywhere so we already started an app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m10s)

[before um already leveraging the generic](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m13s)

[host the color kraken stream two or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m15s)

[three ago i've worked on it a few times](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m18s)

[now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m20s)

[um so we're gonna dive back into that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m21s)

[one again and see about actually getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m23s)

[it set up um for secret management for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m25s)

[configuration with a key vault have all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m29s)

[of that stuff plugged together see what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m31s)

[it takes kind of what what is a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m33s)

[weird and different about when you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m35s)

[doing it as a desktop app and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m36s)

[hopefully that gets you set up for doing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m39s)

[configuration elsewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m40s)

[so um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m43s)

[before we get too carried away i wanted](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m44s)

[to call one thing out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m46s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m48s)

[i need to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m49s)

[that button there we go um i wanted to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m52s)

[call out this tweet from dimitri because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m54s)

[i thought this was rather awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m56s)

[because this question has come up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h02m58s)

[um i know on this stream before as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m00s)

[but uh and there's the link for anybody](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m03s)

[interested so uh dimitri is a principal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m06s)

[program manager with microsoft and he](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m08s)

[was just posting out a thing asking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m10s)

[examples of windows clients](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m12s)

[that are open source on github and this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m14s)

[whole thread is awesome so it's not all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m17s)

[wpf um some of these things are winforms](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m19s)

[related stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m22s)

[some of these tools i use and and love](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m24s)

[very much so there's a lot of there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m26s)

[lot of good ones so if you are looking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m29s)

[for really cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m30s)

[projects to look at and learn from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m32s)

[i threw chocolaties one in there because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m35s)

[i think that's the one i used on my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m37s)

[stream last time someone asked as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m39s)

[but if you're interested that is a great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m41s)

[one to take a look at um okay and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m44s)

[for people who](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m47s)

[are interested or want to follow along](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m48s)

[so it is the the color kraken repo which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m50s)

[is live on chocolaty now so if you if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m53s)

[you would like to install it you can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m56s)

[either grab the the pre-compiled](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h03m58s)

[binaries here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m00s)

[or you can um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m02s)

[just do choco install color cracking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m05s)

[and you're off to the races i think i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m08s)

[actually have the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m10s)

[i do have it i do have it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m13s)

[so here is what the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m16s)

[for those people who may have forgotten](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m18s)

[here is what the app looks like it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m19s)

[just a simple way of being able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m21s)

[manage your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m22s)

[um theming inside of get cracking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m23s)

[because get cracking is awesome and i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m26s)

[realizing i haven't left the title set](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m28s)

[this main window](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m30s)

[we might need to go fix that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m32s)

[there's a 1.1 release](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m34s)

[but before i get the release going i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m36s)

[will do that i will also say i had a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m38s)

[colleague](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m40s)

[um interested in building a port of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m41s)

[for mac](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m43s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m44s)

[i don't know mac but he does so i said](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m45s)

[have at it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m48s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m50s)

[people are interested there's a swift](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m51s)

[project in here i'm not entirely sure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m52s)

[how far along he's got look](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m54s)

[a little bit of work in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h04m59s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m02s)

[go bruce go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m03s)

[um three days ago was the last one into](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m05s)

[there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m08s)

[sweet and i just installed an update to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m10s)

[visual studio so there's no way that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m12s)

[messes up anything i was thinking of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m14s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m16s)

[okay so let's go back into the code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m18s)

[visual studio time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m22s)

[and color crack how can be it was my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m24s)

[last thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m27s)

[what a shock](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m29s)

[okay and then i thought i had did to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m35s)

[where did i put it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m40s)

[yeah so if people are interested the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m45s)

[documentation page for this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m47s)

[here makes that bigger](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m53s)

[oh no problem justin bieber yeah those](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h05m59s)

[those wpf apps from that that twitter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m01s)

[feed are pretty cool stuff so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m04s)

[some of them i've looked at before some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m06s)

[of them were new to me so there were](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m08s)

[several repos that got new stars from me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m09s)

[because i'd never heard of them before](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m11s)

[um okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m13s)

[this one here this is the the eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m15s)

[configuration or as they labeled it here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m17s)

[configuration and dot net and the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m19s)

[big idea here is inside of wpf back from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m22s)

[ye olden days um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m25s)

[people used to go properties](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m28s)

[and obviously this ui is different now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m31s)

[but there's this settings thing here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m34s)

[where you can create application](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m35s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m37s)

[and this is back](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m38s)

[oh man i don't even remember i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m40s)

[this is a pre-existence when i started](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m42s)

[in wpf and.net so this has been around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m44s)

[for a long bloody time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m47s)

[um and with these settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m49s)

[yeah goes back to forms](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m52s)

[with these settings here you really have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m54s)

[two choices the settings come in two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m56s)

[forms user and system system are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h06m58s)

[shared across the system as you might](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m01s)

[expect if there's multiple installs from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m02s)

[different user accounts](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m04s)

[and are read only and then user settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m07s)

[are read write and are saved often](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m12s)

[user profile directory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m13s)

[off in la la land which is great um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m15s)

[these work for very simple use cases if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m18s)

[that's all you want to do is hey i just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m21s)

[want to store some strings i don't want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m23s)

[to think too hard about my configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m25s)

[i just want it local that's fine um so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m27s)

[if all you're doing is something really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m31s)

[simple this will work there's one tiny](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m32s)

[little gotcha um depending on how you do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m35s)

[your installers or what your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m39s)

[distribution mechanism is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m40s)

[sometimes you can get bit by settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m42s)

[not updating or every install blows away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m45s)

[my settings and it starts fresh from the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m48s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m49s)

[really annoying um just be aware of that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m50s)

[that can be that could be somewhat](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m53s)

[problematic because it's tied to um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m55s)

[or the it's tied to the identity of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h07m58s)

[assembly and so without like upgrades or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m00s)

[things like that it can be a pain](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m02s)

[um so this is an option it's not the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m05s)

[option i'm gonna recommend though](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m08s)

[so the configuration and net this is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m10s)

[option we're going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m13s)

[going to take a look at um and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m15s)

[out of the box without doing anything](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m18s)

[you get several of these things for free](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m23s)

[you get settings files such as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m24s)

[appsettings.json again asp.net core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m26s)

[developers are very familiar with this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m28s)

[one they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m29s)

[their project template comes with these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m30s)

[files just sitting there ready to go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m34s)

[environment variables we also get for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m35s)

[free and then we also get command line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m37s)

[arguments for free just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m39s)

[for doing nothing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m41s)

[and by](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m42s)

[doing nothing what i mean is with the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m44s)

[current state of our app because before](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m46s)

[we talked about the generic host and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m48s)

[setting up this host builder and getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m50s)

[that running with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m53s)

[a wpf app for the purposes of dependency](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m55s)

[injection it turns out it's a lot cooler](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h08m58s)

[than that and can do more than just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m00s)

[dependency injection so down buried here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m01s)

[in our create host builder there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m04s)

[another nice little method oops j is not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m07s)

[what we're going for so what is it it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m09s)

[configure blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m11s)

[app configuration so you'll note there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m13s)

[two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m15s)

[configure star configuration methods](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m16s)

[here um app configuration you're wanting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m18s)

[to configure it for your app not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m21s)

[configure it for the generic host so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m23s)

[just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m25s)

[separate those two things in your head](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m26s)

[um but this guy here and so you'll note](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m28s)

[it takes a delegate the two parameters](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m30s)

[are a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m33s)

[a host builder context and a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m34s)

[configuration builder so we'll do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m36s)

[the host](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m38s)

[builder context](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m42s)

[configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m43s)

[builder long and verbose names just so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m45s)

[it's clear](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m47s)

[boom okay so the host builder contacts](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m48s)

[we don't care too much about the more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m51s)

[interesting one is this configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m53s)

[builder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m55s)

[so this guy here as the name implies](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h09m57s)

[this is where we can start plugging in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m00s)

[configuration to do stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m02s)

[which is pretty cool so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m04s)

[how do we go about doing this because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m06s)

[this uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m09s)

[configuration builder ultimately is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m10s)

[going to get us to the point where we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m12s)

[can pull out an eye configuration so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m13s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m16s)

[let's muck with our view model real](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m17s)

[quick just so we can see what i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m19s)

[talking about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m20s)

[so let's do an eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m22s)

[configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m24s)

[but we'll we'll note this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m28s)

[oh no use the right name space pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m30s)

[please okay so break point at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m33s)

[beginning of our view model and you'll](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m35s)

[note this eye configuration interface is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m37s)

[coming from microsoft extensions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m39s)

[configuration namespace](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m41s)

[that is not something i have explicitly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m43s)

[registered here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m47s)

[just by just by default we're gonna pick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m48s)

[some stuff up for free and i like free](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m51s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m55s)

[fire this guy off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h10m56s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m02s)

[diagnostic tools you are in the way uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m07s)

[go away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m11s)

[and you will note our configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m12s)

[now has stuff and so if we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m15s)

[do my locals window](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m20s)

[so i can because this way i can keep it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m22s)

[going without worrying about my tooltip](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m23s)

[closing okay so underneath our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m25s)

[configuration you'll note we have some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m26s)

[providers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m28s)

[and so a couple of these that should be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m29s)

[obvious right away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m31s)

[the ones that we were picking up for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m33s)

[free so our app settings one that just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m35s)

[automatically came in which is great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m38s)

[um and then we've got another uh json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m40s)

[provider that's pointed at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m44s)

[appsettings.production.json so there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m46s)

[some concept of environment that we can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m48s)

[use to kind of toggle that's a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m50s)

[less useful for a wpf application where](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m52s)

[you don't usually control the host where](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m55s)

[your application's running it's a lot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m56s)

[more useful for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h11m58s)

[things like web services where you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m00s)

[will you'll have a little bit more of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m02s)

[that control](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m03s)

[but somebody can feel free to prove me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m05s)

[wrong and then environment variable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m06s)

[provider and you'll note it's just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m08s)

[defaulting to no prefix](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m10s)

[so the first question comes well how do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m12s)

[i get my configuration out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m14s)

[because we could go through the i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m16s)

[configuration interface directly this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m18s)

[this is one option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m20s)

[this is not a great option right so we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m22s)

[could do configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m24s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m27s)

[get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m29s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m31s)

[or get value is probably easier and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m32s)

[start pulling something out uh how about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m34s)

[my value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m37s)

[and string](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m40s)

[my value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m42s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m44s)

[put that there we'll pull it out as a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m48s)

[string we'll read it there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m50s)

[we should really put this stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m53s)

[somewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m54s)

[i was kind of thinking it might be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m57s)

[useful to like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h12m58s)

[rather than grabbing the the default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m00s)

[theme like remember the last theme or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m02s)

[something but eh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m04s)

[for now we'll just we're just going with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m06s)

[breakpoints](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m08s)

[this will be good enough um so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m09s)

[that will read the value out and then in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m11s)

[order to actually get something in there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m14s)

[we probably need our json file so let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m15s)

[go ahead and do one of those guys](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m27s)

[json file and we're just gonna do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m28s)

[appsettings.json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m32s)

[boom okay now one thing to know right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m35s)

[away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m39s)

[i right clicked on the file and with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m40s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m41s)

[so this is something worthwhile to to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m43s)

[know about is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m44s)

[when you have file type so the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m48s)

[default cs proj for all of the new](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m50s)

[projects so the it's called the sdk](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m52s)

[project format which comes from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m54s)

[this little bit right here at the top if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m56s)

[you see like an xml thingy above this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h13m58s)

[you're not on the sdk project format and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m01s)

[your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m03s)

[project file is probably huge](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m03s)

[um and you'll note there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m05s)

[stuff that we get for free like the old](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m07s)

[cs proj file you had to reference all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m08s)

[your files and it was big and ugly this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m10s)

[is much cleaner and nicer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m12s)

[because it comes with a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m14s)

[well-defined defaults such as if it's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m16s)

[dot cs file compile it as though it's c](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m18s)

[sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m21s)

[how what a wonderful default um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m22s)

[but you'll note our app settings one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m25s)

[when we look at his property its build](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m26s)

[action is set to none and copied output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m29s)

[directory is set to do not copy and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m31s)

[that's not quite what we want so what we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m33s)

[can do here is we can drop down and say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m35s)

[okay copy the file to our output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m36s)

[directory if the file is newer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m38s)

[and this is going to be pretty good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m41s)

[but you'll note when we edit it through](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m45s)

[visual studio the the helpful uh ui does](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m46s)

[what we want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m51s)

[but it does it very specific to an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m53s)

[individual file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m54s)

[i prefer to do something more akin to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m57s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h14m59s)

[let's say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m00s)

[if i add a json file to my project](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m01s)

[always copy it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m04s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m06s)

[i almost never have a situation where i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m07s)

[have a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m09s)

[oh that looks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m11s)

[my indentation settings are funny](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m13s)

[or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m16s)

[there i almost never have a situation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m18s)

[where i have um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m20s)

[json files added and i don't want them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m22s)

[to go anywhere and i just want them to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m25s)

[stay at my project room that's pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m26s)

[unusual okay so appsettings.json and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m28s)

[then we called the setting we wanted my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m31s)

[sounds great let's come in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m34s)

[my value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m37s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m40s)

[value from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m42s)

[apps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m43s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m44s)

[okay let's fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m46s)

[and hopefully it works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m49s)

[otherwise i'm going to feel a little bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m50s)

[like a fool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m51s)

[hey look at that it pulls it out yay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m55s)

[we can read a string huzzah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h15m57s)

[and what's important to note is that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m00s)

[this set of providers this is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m03s)

[hierarchy so the order that providers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m05s)

[are added in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m08s)

[matters because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m09s)

[the um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m11s)

[the more specific providers or the later](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m13s)

[providers are going to override the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m15s)

[previous providers which is great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m17s)

[because now you can start to build up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m19s)

[sort of hey these are my common settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m22s)

[and then these are my more specific ones](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m24s)

[for my particular use case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m26s)

[again when you don't control the host](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m28s)

[you got to be a little bit more careful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m29s)

[with that but we don't have to rely on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m31s)

[just these settings files](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m33s)

[we could](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m35s)

[choose to change this up and add in our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m36s)

[own json configuration provider that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m39s)

[does something more specific](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m41s)

[which is cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m43s)

[the one the one thing about this setup](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m45s)

[here which is which is great for getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m48s)

[configuration in and rolling](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m50s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m52s)

[this is checked into source control](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m53s)

[right so i don't actually want to put](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m56s)

[things like username and password in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h16m58s)

[here that's a bad idea so i will say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m01s)

[that again please please please do not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m04s)

[put sensitive values in your repos that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m07s)

[is bad bad bad](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m10s)

[fortunately that's what we're gonna fix](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m15s)

[tonight](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m17s)

[i may have had too much caffeine today](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m18s)

[it's possible if i'm talking too fast](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m20s)

[please tell me to slow down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m22s)

[i may have had a lot of caffeine today](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m25s)

[you wake up tired and now you feel like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m29s)

[there's a bit of a buzz](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m31s)

[okay so one other thing to one other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m32s)

[thing to note too so rather than just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m34s)

[string value let's do something a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m35s)

[more interesting more mountain dew](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m38s)

[robert you're a badass bad influence](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m43s)

[okay so let's let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m45s)

[let's go through and let's do something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m47s)

[more interesting than strings real quick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m48s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m51s)

[well i'll just do it right here so let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m52s)

[go through we'll create a record so how](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m54s)

[about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m56s)

[uh public record uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h17m57s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m01s)

[yeah that sounds good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m03s)

[uh string uh string](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m04s)

[uh value and how about string](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m08s)

[uh last](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m12s)

[template](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m13s)

[is that the does that match the name of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m15s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m17s)

[last theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m18s)

[that's the word i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m20s)

[boom okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m21s)

[simple record](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m24s)

[nothing fancy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m26s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m27s)

[let's now imagine i want to do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m28s)

[and i'm going to pull the value out of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m32s)

[settings instead so before i just had a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m34s)

[simple string and i was pulling uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m36s)

[i mean how else are you going to beat](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m43s)

[your high score on the blood clearance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m44s)

[machine oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m45s)

[oh that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m47s)

[why don't that one go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m49s)

[before i say something i regret](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m51s)

[so before we were just pulling a simple](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m53s)

[string out and that was easy name value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m55s)

[name value but more often than not what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h18m57s)

[we have is we want to have something a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m00s)

[lot more complex we don't want just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m02s)

[simple types we can do simple types](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m04s)

[that's a good place to start but very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m06s)

[often we want to start organizing these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m08s)

[things into nicer groupings and json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m10s)

[conveniently has a hierarchy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m13s)

[right like json isn't just a set of name](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m15s)

[values](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m18s)

[it kind of is except for the values can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m19s)

[be complex objects that then have more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m21s)

[name values and descends all the way in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m23s)

[so let's go through and let's do this so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m26s)

[we go settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m28s)

[and we're going to do this and i already](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m31s)

[forgot what i called the things value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m33s)

[and last name so we'll do value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m39s)

[my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m41s)

[awesome value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m42s)

[that's not expel value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m44s)

[and it's important to get your json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m46s)

[syntax correct](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m47s)

[and then we said last theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m54s)

[custom thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h19m59s)

[now obviously we could put more things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m00s)

[in here we could keep doing more nested](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m02s)

[types but what we can do now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m04s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m07s)

[put a breakpoint here and fire it up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m09s)

[oh and it didn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m16s)

[what did i do wrong](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m21s)

[uh if the wpf app doesn't have jason's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m24s)

[stuff dependencies is it good to add](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m27s)

[them in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m28s)

[in the settings format](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m29s)

[um you can still go through and do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m32s)

[with the settings so the and here let me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m35s)

[actually let me pop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m38s)

[because i didn't actually show them i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m40s)

[just didn't want to add them to the repo](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m41s)

[but here i will let me actually go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m42s)

[through and show what that looks like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m45s)

[because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m47s)

[so it is it is not bad to do it this way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m50s)

[i will say that it is not horrible so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m53s)

[when you when you go into the project](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m56s)

[properties and click the little button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m57s)

[to add it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h20m58s)

[so you'll note here there's a list of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m00s)

[types there's kind of a lot of the usual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m02s)

[characters you would expect with your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m04s)

[your primitives and you've got some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m06s)

[special built-in support for like date](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m08s)

[time grids time spans that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m10s)

[um and you can actually add in your own](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m13s)

[types here that is a thing you can do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m15s)

[the ui doesn't help you but you can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m17s)

[certainly make it do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m19s)

[and then you'll note scope](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m20s)

[user or i guess application not system i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m22s)

[had that name wrong i think i said](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m25s)

[earlier but the short version is read](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m26s)

[write read](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m28s)

[and you can and you can set them up here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m31s)

[so if you're just looking for a quick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m33s)

[and dirty way to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m35s)

[persistent settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m38s)

[this definitely works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m39s)

[it works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m41s)

[the moment you want to get more complex](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m43s)

[this quickly runs into limitations](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m46s)

[it's also worth knowing that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m50s)

[this is not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m52s)

[this is because this is stored on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m54s)

[local system](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m56s)

[if you want to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m57s)

[have something stored out elsewhere like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h21m59s)

[for example maybe after somebody logs in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m01s)

[you want to give them some sort of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m04s)

[access or whatnot this is not the place](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m07s)

[to store that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m09s)

[this is just an xml file in a well-known](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m10s)

[directory so worth noting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m13s)

[so it's not bad to store it there it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m16s)

[just limiting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m22s)

[if you're cool with the limitations it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m22s)

[not bad i'll say that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m27s)

[get value settings what the heck did i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m28s)

[do here settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m33s)

[did i not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m34s)

[just get value not appropriately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m37s)

[break apart custom types what did i do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m40s)

[wrong here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m45s)

[we might just do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m46s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m47s)

[the other thing you can do is just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m51s)

[straight go right in on it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h22m53s)

[the application settings area is where i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m00s)

[like to store all of the default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m02s)

[settings and again that's not a bad](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m03s)

[place to put it if you're just looking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m05s)

[for where do i put my configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m07s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m09s)

[it works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m10s)

[it definitely works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m12s)

[why are you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m15s)

[what am i what am i missing here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m21s)

[configuration oh is it configuration get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m22s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m27s)

[that's okay that's what i did wrong oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m31s)

[please](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m34s)

[i can't remember the apis okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m35s)

[ignore that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m39s)

[that's a lie um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m40s)

[so configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m44s)

[get section](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m46s)

[settings there we are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m48s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m52s)

[settings section](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m54s)

[and please don't copy this code there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m56s)

[a cleaner option we'll get to it in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m57s)

[minute um settings section and then we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h23m59s)

[can do something like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m01s)

[get value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m03s)

[there we are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m07s)

[so if we wanted this is the manual way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m08s)

[so if you ever find yourself in need of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m11s)

[it this this is the the manual option so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m12s)

[value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m15s)

[last name](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m17s)

[value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m19s)

[and this is the last part i'm going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m22s)

[do the manual way because it's already](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m23s)

[annoying me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m25s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m26s)

[last theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m27s)

[last thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m31s)

[filling counts](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m32s)

[but not always as i discovered earlier](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m35s)

[today i was doing pipeline work and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m37s)

[spelling definitely bit me okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m39s)

[pull out the nested section inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m44s)

[the section you can pull out into that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m46s)

[individual values it's very similar to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m48s)

[what we did pulling values straight off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m50s)

[the eye configuration but with this you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m52s)

[can start](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m55s)

[building up hierarchies for this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h24m59s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m00s)

[let's let's not do this anymore because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m01s)

[in general](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m03s)

[taking in an eye configuration um is not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m05s)

[something that i typically would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m08s)

[recommend you bring in through your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m12s)

[into your view model](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m13s)

[because very typically your view models](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m14s)

[are not going to need the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m17s)

[entirety of eye configuration that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m19s)

[almost certainly not what they're after](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m22s)

[more often than not your your view](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m24s)

[models or services they're going to need](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m26s)

[bits and pieces of the configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m28s)

[they're going to need maybe the the base](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m30s)

[url for a web service they're going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m33s)

[need to know the last theme that the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m35s)

[user had selected something like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m37s)

[they aren't going to need](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m39s)

[all your configuration so this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m40s)

[usually way overkill and it's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m42s)

[in my opinion a bit of a code smell to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m46s)

[have it in so what is the better option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m48s)

[so i made this lovely little settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m51s)

[class up here so let's actually use it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m54s)

[so there is another lovely interface](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m57s)

[called eye options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h25m59s)

[and you should stop debugging when you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m02s)

[start typing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m03s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m06s)

[so we are going to use eye options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m10s)

[and we're going to call this settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m14s)

[instead because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m16s)

[that other one is bad okay get rid of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m18s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m20s)

[okay this is by far preferable because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m21s)

[you'll note now inside of my code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m23s)

[i'm not thinking about eye configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m26s)

[i'm not thinking about settings or about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m28s)

[i'm not thinking about individual values](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m30s)

[anymore i'm literally just going oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m32s)

[here's my options let's pull the value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m36s)

[off and now i've got last theme and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m38s)

[value i can work with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m40s)

[this is by far more preferable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m43s)

[because now in my code here in my view](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m46s)

[model i can focus on the portion of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m49s)

[configuration that's important to me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m51s)

[i don't need to worry about all of my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m53s)

[configuration i don't need to remember](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m55s)

[keys i don't need to remember any of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m56s)

[that stuff i just need to do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h26m58s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m02s)

[so but how do we set this up because if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m03s)

[we run this right now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m05s)

[there's no way for this this to get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m07s)

[populated for us because we haven't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m09s)

[given the configuration any knowledge](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m11s)

[about hey](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m13s)

[how do you populate this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m15s)

[so let's go back to our app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m17s)

[there i already have it open okay in our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m22s)

[configuration here and actually down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m25s)

[here on our services so what we need to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m27s)

[do is we need to actually register up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m30s)

[um the options so that we have them so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m33s)

[what we will do is we will do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m35s)

[uh services uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m37s)

[and then there's add](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m40s)

[options hey](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m42s)

[almost like exactly what we wanted and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m43s)

[we will do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m45s)

[our settings option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m49s)

[should i rename this is that clear that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m51s)

[this isn't a built-in class i'm going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m52s)

[rename this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m56s)

[just to be clear that this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h27m58s)

[not some built-in type](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m00s)

[uh we decided to try this way we use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m02s)

[light db for application settings and we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m05s)

[store all small settings classes as is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m07s)

[so it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m10s)

[unusually convenient i can believe that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m11s)

[i've seen other people do something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m14s)

[similar with like a um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m16s)

[a sql light database](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m18s)

[and it oftentimes works rather well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m20s)

[um i'm trying to remember is light db a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m24s)

[sequel or no sql based setup](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m28s)

[uh it's nosql right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m32s)

[yeah which means you can probably just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m37s)

[dump everything in and it works great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m38s)

[yeah i i i came across this when people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m43s)

[were looking for alternatives to sql](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m45s)

[light at one point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m47s)

[i have not had any](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m49s)

[opportunity to use it in a project but i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m52s)

[remember it being on the list of um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m54s)

[options we were considering](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h28m56s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m00s)

[having uh linky style support over it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m01s)

[just awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m04s)

[and then of course anything in c sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m06s)

[is just great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m08s)

[that it that is another option as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m11s)

[um and we will see in a little bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m13s)

[if you wanted to use eye configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m16s)

[as an abstraction into that so that your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m18s)

[code didn't need light db that would be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m20s)

[an option as well because we're going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m22s)

[end up writing a little provider in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m24s)

[moment okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m26s)

[uh so we are going to add settings and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m27s)

[then or i'm sorry add options and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m29s)

[what we want to do is actually tell the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m32s)

[the i configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m35s)

[where where are the values for this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m37s)

[going to come from so that would be the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m38s)

[bind and then we're going to go with our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m41s)

[host context](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m42s)

[so recall that this is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m44s)

[first parameter from up here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m46s)

[it has access to an eye configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m49s)

[uh let's see i configuration and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m53s)

[we're gonna call it get section so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m55s)

[the whole reason for writing that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h29m58s)

[earlier stuff before of iterating over i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m00s)

[configuration is just showing that's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m02s)

[where the data comes from it's really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m04s)

[most important for doing this binding up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m06s)

[front](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m09s)

[so in our case the section in question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m10s)

[that we care about is called settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m12s)

[so we will just put that there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m15s)

[do that and i think that's all we need](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m19s)

[fire this up real quick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m23s)

[and you'll note now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m29s)

[when we hit our constructor](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m31s)

[what is it saying missing value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m38s)

[something or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m40s)

[another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m45s)

[uh reload](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m48s)

[settings value something is weird so i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m52s)

[going to just do this here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m55s)

[var](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m56s)

[settings gets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h30m58s)

[settings dot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m00s)

[oh uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m02s)

[oh it's a much better name](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m06s)

[reload and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m10s)

[nope nope](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m13s)

[okay we're gonna relaunch i think the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m14s)

[historical debugger just got all kinds](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m17s)

[of confused when i did that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m18s)

[uh i cannot dynamically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m22s)

[uh oh no pro oh because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m24s)

[grumble grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m27s)

[because one of us made it a record type](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m29s)

[it was so bloody convenient until it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m33s)

[wasn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m35s)

[so we'll do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m38s)

[this this this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m43s)

[public](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m46s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m49s)

[get set](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m52s)

[get set okay this is actually a question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m56s)

[that came up with several colleagues](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h31m58s)

[two days ago](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m03s)

[when you have a poco so a plain old c](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m04s)

[sharp object like this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m06s)

[um and you have nullable reference types](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m09s)

[turned on which i do in this project or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m11s)

[if you're on dot net six that they're on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m13s)

[by default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m16s)

[of i i want to declare this as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m17s)

[non-nullable because i know that there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m19s)

[always going to be a value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m21s)

[and the this one particularly came up in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m25s)

[the idea of entity framework where the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m28s)

[pocos were used to represent um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m31s)

[rows in a database table and you know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m34s)

[the column in the database is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m36s)

[non-nullable therefore when i read the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m38s)

[poco out of ef i know that that value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m40s)

[will always can that value will always](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m42s)

[be present](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m45s)

[even though](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m46s)

[there's nothing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m47s)

[even though i may set it as noble the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m50s)

[problem is is there's um a little bit of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m52s)

[a catch catch-22 here the noble](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m54s)

[reference type is not designed to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m56s)

[reflect what you know at runtime it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h32m59s)

[designed to reflect what is known at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m02s)

[compile time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m04s)

[and so you are always going to get a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m05s)

[warning and i have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m07s)

[my my personal rule is if it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m09s)

[serializable it's nullable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m11s)

[and to date i have not seen a counter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m13s)

[example of it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m15s)

[i'm sure somebody will find one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m16s)

[but i think it's probably pretty safe to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m19s)

[say as a general rule if it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m21s)

[serializable it's nullable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m22s)

[and it's really hard to come up with a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m27s)

[case where it's where it's not possible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m29s)

[to be known](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m32s)

[so in this case this is definitely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m33s)

[serializable so let's try this again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m35s)

[i think this time around it'll probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m38s)

[do a little better](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m40s)

[hey look at that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m43s)

[and it read the values app so don't use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m46s)

[a record](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m49s)

[as your settings type it doesn't work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m50s)

[well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m52s)

[or at least use a record with a default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m54s)

[constructor and make sure to do your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m56s)

[auto properties on it i suppose that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m57s)

[would work too](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h33m59s)

[here proof is in the pudding](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m02s)

[we'll declare it as record class uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m04s)

[worth noting um when records were first](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m06s)

[added you didn't have record class you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m08s)

[just had record but when they added](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m10s)

[record struct they also allowed record](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m12s)

[class to exist](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m16s)

[it is identical to just omitting the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m17s)

[word class this is completely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m19s)

[superfluous however given that there are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m20s)

[now more than one type of record it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m23s)

[usually recommended to always say record](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m26s)

[class rather than just record by itself](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m27s)

[but you'll note the only advantage by](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m30s)

[doing that is now we pick up the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m32s)

[benefits of records we've got a nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m33s)

[two-string implementation now that just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m35s)

[shows us all our properties i've got](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m38s)

[nice equality members built up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m39s)

[okay so that gets us there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m46s)

[okay so quick recap](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m51s)

[we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m55s)

[can set up our view models with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m56s)

[eye options classes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h34m58s)

[we can structure our settings inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m00s)

[json files in nice pretty ways](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m03s)

[um if you wanted to do this same sort of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m06s)

[hierarchy with environment variables](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m08s)

[this would actually as an environment](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m11s)

[variable this would end up being](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m13s)

[settings underscore underscore](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m14s)

[value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m17s)

[would get you this one so because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m18s)

[environment variables are inherently](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m21s)

[just name values](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m23s)

[they aren't anything fancy and actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m25s)

[i think we can show that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m26s)

[if i have a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m29s)

[i might have to do it through the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m32s)

[i don't have a launch settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m34s)

[pretty sure we can do it here uh debug](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m38s)

[launch profiles ui](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m42s)

[environment variables so if we come in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m44s)

[here and do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m46s)

[settings we'll do underscore underscore](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m51s)

[value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m53s)

[launch this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m54s)

[and then environment variables](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m55s)

[the settings underscore underscore value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h35m58s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m02s)

[uh from enb](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m05s)

[if i save that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m09s)

[there's my launch settings that's all i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m13s)

[wanted](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m14s)

[there's all that's all i wanted okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m16s)

[if we fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m19s)

[do do oh did i turn off my break point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m23s)

[well if you turn off your break point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m27s)

[you don't stop at the break point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m29s)

[that's not helpful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m31s)

[that doesn't help anyone](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m32s)

[so you'll note now our value here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m36s)

[didn't catch it quickly let's try that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m40s)

[again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m41s)

[okay locals window it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m44s)

[boom our value here now shows from env](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m46s)

[and the only reason it does that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m51s)

[because the providers that are added in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m53s)

[order start off with the the json file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m55s)

[so it's appsettings.json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h36m58s)

[appsettings.environment which in our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m00s)

[case is always production.json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m02s)

[then environment variables so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m04s)

[environment variables get to supersede](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m05s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m07s)

[so because we added an environment](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m08s)

[variable that's now overriding what we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m10s)

[had here which can be a quite a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m12s)

[convenient way of doing this and again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m14s)

[you can clear these reorder them do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m16s)

[whatever you need to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m18s)

[if you wanted to manipulate them right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m20s)

[inside of here is where you would do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m22s)

[with configuration builder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m26s)

[or is it host builder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m28s)

[one of you guys host builder context has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m30s)

[the providers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m33s)

[builder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m36s)

[providers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m39s)

[why am i confused one of these guys has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m41s)

[the the list of them in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m43s)

[could be the latter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m47s)

[it might just be hidden from me oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m51s)

[sources](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m52s)

[there it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m53s)

[so if you wanted to clear one add one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m55s)

[remove it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m57s)

[reorder them you can do what you'd like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h37m59s)

[the default is just in that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m01s)

[particular setup](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m03s)

[and it's worth noting the for all of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m05s)

[this eye configuration stuff that i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m07s)

[showing here this is exactly as it works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m08s)

[in asp.net core so if you're doing web](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m11s)

[related stuff this probably seems](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m13s)

[remarkably familiar but it doesn't have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m14s)

[to be related to asp.net core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m16s)

[be any c-sharp app where you use the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m19s)

[generic host you can get all of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m21s)

[behavior](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m23s)

[just by doing this kind of setup](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m24s)

[which is great we can get all of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m27s)

[awesomeness](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m29s)

[beyond everything else](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m31s)

[because asp.net core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m33s)

[often times what people don't realize](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m35s)

[isn't much fancier than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m37s)

[a framework built on a console app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m39s)

[real that's all it really is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m42s)

[um it's a really cool framework with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m44s)

[lots of stuff but that's all it is and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m46s)

[so because all of uh because we now have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m49s)

[gotten into this wonderful state where](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m51s)

[there's kind of one.net with dotnet5](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m53s)

[and.net six](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m55s)

[all of the stuff that we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m57s)

[we get to love on one framework we can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h38m59s)

[just pull those bits in and use them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m01s)

[elsewhere which is awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m03s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m05s)

[uh been learning to love asp.net at my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m07s)

[job](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m09s)

[see that's what i love to hear metal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m10s)

[slug](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m12s)

[that is awesome uh are you i assume](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m13s)

[you're on asp net core given that you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m15s)

[saying that you're loving it i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m18s)

[assuming it's core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m19s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m21s)

[three year later](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m22s)

[i'm guessing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m24s)

[because that's when it that's when i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m26s)

[feel like i got really good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m27s)

[uh yeah 3-0](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m31s)

[yeah um about the 3-0 time frame i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m34s)

[is when it got really good because they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m36s)

[initially did net core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m38s)

[and the initial release was a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m39s)

[rough they smoothed over a lot of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m41s)

[rough edges in like the 202 or i should](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m43s)

[say 2x range](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m46s)

[and then when they hit 3x things started](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m48s)

[to get a lot nicer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m50s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m52s)

[5-0 and 6-0](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m53s)

[came with a lot of changes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m55s)

[but a lot of it wasn't like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h39m57s)

[ground-breaking shaking stuff it was the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m00s)

[the the cool new stuff was all around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m03s)

[like language features for c-sharp and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m05s)

[a lot of performance huge performance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m08s)

[increases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m10s)

[uh in five and six okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m13s)

[eye options in there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m16s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m18s)

[i promised something about secrets when](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m19s)

[i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m21s)

[started darn it we're going to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m22s)

[something with secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m24s)

[because secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m26s)

[happen all the bloody time and very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m28s)

[often](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m31s)

[they are forgotten about and because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m33s)

[people often deem them as hard they just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m34s)

[get checked in please please please](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m37s)

[please please please please do not do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m39s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m40s)

[okay so let's start with the the stupid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m41s)

[simple option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m44s)

[stupid simple option so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m46s)

[uh where is the secrets option manage](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m48s)

[user secrets that's the button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m50s)

[and then conveniently visual studio goes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m53s)

[hey would you like the nuget package and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m55s)

[all of the right required setup](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m57s)

[yes write all the code for me please](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h40m59s)

[it should have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m02s)

[i don't know why it does this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m07s)

[i ran into this problem earlier today](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m10s)

[i don't know if it's a bug in my visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m13s)

[studio or the fact that i'm not on a the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m15s)

[expected project type but it doesn't do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m17s)

[the right thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m19s)

[boo](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m22s)

[okay specifically it doesn't go and add](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m23s)

[the nougat package so we're gonna go out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m24s)

[and get the new get package ourselves](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m26s)

[so something something something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m29s)

[secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m32s)

[uh boom that one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m34s)

[and let's not grab a pre-release](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m37s)

[so yeah in general you can just do a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m40s)

[quick search and just kind of going down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m42s)

[by download numbers the one with 182](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m44s)

[million yeah that's the one you want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m48s)

[just from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m51s)

[sheer download numbers wait is there an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m52s)

[it has an update](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m55s)

[do i need to update a package](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h41m57s)

[oh look at that there's a new release](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m00s)

[there yeah sure why not let's grab that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m02s)

[too](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m04s)

[we'll grab that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m05s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m06s)

[see this is the beautiful thing about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m07s)

[semantic version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m09s)

[when you see the minor version there you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m11s)

[can be fairly confident that it only](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m13s)

[contains things that are bug fixes and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m15s)

[there should be no breaking changes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m17s)

[for people not familiar with semantic](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m21s)

[versioning](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m23s)

[december.org this is something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m24s)

[if you're building libraries](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m28s)

[specifically this is important to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m30s)

[um if you are building apps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m33s)

[apps do not necessarily need to follow](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m35s)

[semantic versioning](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m38s)

[and yes assuming people follow it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m40s)

[correctly that is a very good point um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m41s)

[a lot of people don't the microsoft](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m45s)

[libraries do thank goodness](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m47s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m51s)

[secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m54s)

[and the reason to follow it is because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m56s)

[if people real know that you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h42m58s)

[following it um it ends up making um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m00s)

[upgrades a lot easier so you'll note it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m03s)

[was a whole lot easier for me to just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m06s)

[adapt and say yes please](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m08s)

[okay now i've got the user secrets guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m10s)

[added in huzzah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m13s)

[now we'll manage user secrets there we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m15s)

[go that's what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m18s)

[okay so you'll note here it gave me a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m20s)

[secrets.json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m22s)

[the other change that it made is inside](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m24s)

[of my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m27s)

[cs proj you'll note it's it randomly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m29s)

[generated a guide and set it as its use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m32s)

[uh user secrets id so if we build our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m35s)

[app now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m38s)

[i think i'm going to go with um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m40s)

[i normally show off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m43s)

[oh see i already have it open i normally](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m46s)

[show off dnspy but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m48s)

[the n spy has been archived with no](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m51s)

[indication that it's going to continue](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m54s)

[on which doesn't make me happy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m58s)

[uh if you look at your compiled](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h43m58s)

[application when that uh user secrets id](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m00s)

[so 2ce](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m04s)

[ca something or another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m06s)

[uh when your application gets compiled](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m08s)

[it gets turned into an assembly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m10s)

[attribute so there's now something in my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m12s)

[compiled code with that same guide](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m14s)

[now why is that important](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m17s)

[because down here back in our app.xaml](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m19s)

[we can tell it to use that as a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m24s)

[configuration source so if we go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m26s)

[uh configuration builder let's see was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m28s)

[it add user secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m31s)

[the crets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m35s)

[find it boom thank you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m38s)

[uh and then you'll know it wants an id](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m41s)

[so you can either type in your grid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m44s)

[manually uh but that's that's a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m45s)

[work and i don't want to type in width](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m48s)

[because i don't hate myself](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m51s)

[but if i just grab my type and feed it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m54s)

[the assembly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m56s)

[what it will then do is it will look at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h44m58s)

[the assembly say okay go into the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m00s)

[assembly look for that assembly level](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m02s)

[attribute and read the grid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m04s)

[why is that useful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m07s)

[well these secrets.json files if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m08s)

[just right click on it and hit open](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m11s)

[containing folder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m12s)

[all this thing is doing when it does](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m15s)

[user secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m17s)

[this is just a really fancy json](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m19s)

[provider that's it it's not any more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m21s)

[advanced than that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m23s)

[so what it ends up doing is creating](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m25s)

[this uh secrets.json inside of a user](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m27s)

[secrets folder and you'll note that grid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m31s)

[shows her up again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m33s)

[that's it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m36s)

[so if you have multiple apps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m37s)

[as you can see i've got at least several](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m40s)

[occasionally i will clear stuff out of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m42s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m44s)

[that are using the grids](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m46s)

[this is where they all are and i'm not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m48s)

[going to open those up because i can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m49s)

[almost guarantee that the files in there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m50s)

[contain things that i should probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m52s)

[not show on stream](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m55s)

[as much fun as it is to go and cycle my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m56s)

[keys for things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h45m58s)

[so if you want a quick and easy way to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m00s)

[to do secret management this is a nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m02s)

[way to do it because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m04s)

[one you get nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m06s)

[id support inside of visual studio but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m08s)

[it is just a json file now it's worth](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m10s)

[noting that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m13s)

[this file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m16s)

[was in my local user profile directory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m17s)

[or nested underneath my my local user](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m20s)

[profile so if i can get that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m22s)

[i can do this boom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m24s)

[yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m26s)

[so you'll note underneath my user](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m27s)

[underneath my roaming app data folder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m29s)

[so microsoft user secrets so this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m32s)

[just a local json file now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m34s)

[i don't know how many people are like me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m38s)

[but i've got my desktop here that i use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m39s)

[for streaming but i also have a laptop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m42s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m44s)

[this can be mildly obnoxious when i am](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m45s)

[working on my desktop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m48s)

[push my repo and then go and pull down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m50s)

[it on my laptop because then it's like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m53s)

[dang dabbit what were those user secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m56s)

[and one option is you can legitimately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h46m58s)

[just go and copy this file around that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m00s)

[that's one option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m04s)

[and we'll get to that here in just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m05s)

[second but let's start with this so now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m07s)

[that we've added user secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m09s)

[it's worth noting that when we call an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m11s)

[add method in here we're being added](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m13s)

[after the built-in ones](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m18s)

[before we had](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m19s)

[we had this value that was my awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m22s)

[value that we then overrode](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m24s)

[with our launch settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m27s)

[from an environment variable and now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m29s)

[we've got a user secrets so what we can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m31s)

[do here is we can actually steal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m33s)

[straight out of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m35s)

[gonna be lazy real quick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m38s)

[and then i'm just gonna delete the stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m40s)

[i don't care about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m44s)

[super secret local value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m47s)

[all right so we fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h47m52s)

[and if we go look here now you'll note](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m00s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m03s)

[and i gotta figure out a way to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m04s)

[to show that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m06s)

[there we go locals](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m07s)

[so you'll note now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m09s)

[this super secret local value has now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m11s)

[overridden our environment variable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m13s)

[because well we added our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m15s)

[our secrets provider last so anything in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m17s)

[our secrets file now gets to win](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m20s)

[and you know this one is still coming](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m23s)

[from our base json file because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m25s)

[no one's bothered to change it yet](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m27s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m30s)

[do i have a stray](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m32s)

[apostrophe in my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m34s)

[json file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m37s)

[i do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m38s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m40s)

[that's what happens when you let stray](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m42s)

[characters float around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m44s)

[i joked with a colleague a few days ago](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m49s)

[wondering how many developer hours have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m52s)

[been wasted because of single character](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m54s)

[level mistakes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m56s)

[because i know i've contributed my fair](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h48m58s)

[share of hours to that pool and i'm sure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m00s)

[most of you probably have as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m02s)

[feels](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m06s)

[feels horrible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m10s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m12s)

[uh okay so there's that so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m16s)

[local settings are a great option uh or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m18s)

[i should say local secrets are a great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m22s)

[option when you want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m24s)

[uh effectively](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m26s)

[uh to set up uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m27s)

[local secrets that you want to work with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m32s)

[and they're basically developer level](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m35s)

[stuff the single white space that hurts](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m37s)

[so much](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m41s)

[that sounds like the voice of experience](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m43s)

[robert](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m45s)

[um let me find because i had a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m46s)

[i had a wonderful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h49m50s)

[oh that is that is something we didn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m02s)

[didn't show in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m04s)

[uh maybe we'll come back to that here in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m08s)

[a minute because i was going to show](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m12s)

[i wanted to get all the way into some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m14s)

[more that more interesting secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m16s)

[i think this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m19s)

[yeah this is the page](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m22s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m24s)

[this is this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m25s)

[this is the guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m27s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m29s)

[and i'm gonna just clean up the link](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m32s)

[before i post it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m34s)

[it's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m35s)

[quite as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m37s)

[ugly boom there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m38s)

[so there are a large number and actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m42s)

[i should find the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m45s)

[the full link](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m46s)

[uh there oh oh i just saw it i just saw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m48s)

[it come back](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m51s)

[there that'll work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m54s)

[um this one here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m55s)

[so there is actually uh that's not the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m56s)

[full list](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h50m59s)

[providers there is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m04s)

[no](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m09s)

[no no no no no](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m13s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m14s)

[one of that's more like what i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m16s)

[expecting to see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m18s)

[okay so there are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m21s)

[a lot of providers out there so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m23s)

[basic ones that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m25s)

[that i think we've shown most of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m27s)

[basic file providers environment](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m31s)

[variable virus command line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m33s)

[configuration provider](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m34s)

[arbitrary in memory configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m37s)

[provider if you just want to feed it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m39s)

[like a dictionary](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m40s)

[because you have a dictionary from some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m41s)

[source maybe you read it out of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m44s)

[something there are built-in support for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m45s)

[those so if you want the a quick and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m48s)

[easy way of using eye configuration and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m50s)

[perhaps maybe you're storing your stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m52s)

[in maybe a light db and you've already](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m54s)

[read the thing out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m55s)

[um but you'd like your code to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m56s)

[decoupled from that and going through a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h51m59s)

[common like eye options interface](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m00s)

[you could simply use the memory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m03s)

[configuration provider all of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m04s)

[providers um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m06s)

[are either in the box with the i uh the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m08s)

[configuration or they are in their own](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m11s)

[nougat package](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m14s)

[uh this one i believe the memory one i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m16s)

[think is in its](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m19s)

[uh yes this guy is in his own nougat](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m20s)

[package it looks like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m22s)

[but you can feed it your arbitrary](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m25s)

[dictionary of stuff and now the stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m27s)

[just works which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m30s)

[it is important to note that different](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m34s)

[providers have different ways of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m35s)

[specifying hierarchy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m37s)

[because there's a desire to have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m39s)

[configuration be hierarchical so so like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m41s)

[i want you know this option contains](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m44s)

[this option contains that all the way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m46s)

[down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m48s)

[um with json it's easy with things that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m48s)

[are inherently string based there are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m51s)

[always the limiter characters the common](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m54s)

[ones are double underscore colon or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m56s)

[double hyphen i think that covers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h52m58s)

[between those three i think that will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m01s)

[cover most of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m02s)

[configuration providers and this if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m05s)

[want a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m07s)

[long read](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m08s)

[this is the long read one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m10s)

[boom there's the long read one of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m16s)

[all of the stuff now it's worth noting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m19s)

[this is this one is specifically um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m21s)

[under the asp.net documentation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m23s)

[but again we can pull in those nuget](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m27s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m29s)

[so even though this was built for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m30s)

[asp.net core](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m32s)

[a lot of the stuff built for asp.net](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m33s)

[core is usable elsewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m36s)

[unless it's something that's like tied](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m38s)

[to http or something it's usually pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m40s)

[simple to pull it in elsewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m44s)

[and configuration isn't webby by nature](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m46s)

[so yeah we just referenced nuget](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m49s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m51s)

[okay so something something something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m53s)

[something something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m55s)

[where'd i go ah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m56s)

[now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h53m59s)

[the one i want to get to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m00s)

[keeval](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m02s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m03s)

[the problem i run into uh and the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m04s)

[problem that that bit me earlier this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m06s)

[week is i had an app that was connecting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m09s)

[to a third party service](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m11s)

[the third party service](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m13s)

[so i it was just a simple cli app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m15s)

[nothing fancy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m18s)

[but to connect to the the third party](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m20s)

[services api you had to pass a key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m22s)

[fairly common um the problem is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m25s)

[the the repo is public i obviously](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m28s)

[didn't want to check my key into a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m31s)

[public repo that would be bad](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m32s)

[so i was like well let's just put it in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m35s)

[the user sequence quick easy work fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m37s)

[great everyone was happy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m40s)

[the the problem is is because i've got](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m42s)

[multiple machines and then it's like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m43s)

[well i want to give somebody else access](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m45s)

[and i was like ah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m48s)

[dang it how do how do i effectively](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m50s)

[start to almost do secret level](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m53s)

[management of this because the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m55s)

[secrets.json is not a great way to do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h54m57s)

[and at the end of the day this cli app i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m00s)

[just publish it as a net global tool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m03s)

[that's fine wonderful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m05s)

[here i can i can keep talking about or i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m07s)

[can just show it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m10s)

[it's not it's not fancy it's not fancy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m11s)

[at all and i'm actually in the process](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m13s)

[of updating it uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m15s)

[so uh where i work we use a app called](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m19s)

[oh that's not where i want to go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m23s)

[nope that's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m25s)

[i need to learn how to use a mouse i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m28s)

[apologize so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m29s)

[there's the repo uh where i work we use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m31s)

[a thing called toggle to keep track of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m33s)

[our our time it's just a simple way of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m36s)

[doing timesheets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m39s)

[because i work largely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m40s)

[in a consultant type role so we have to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m42s)

[know how much time we spend working for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m45s)

[various projects and clients so that we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m46s)

[can build them appropriately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m48s)

[so i am way too lazy to open their](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m50s)

[website yes i am aware that they have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m52s)

[apps that are wonderful and awesome but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m54s)

[i am a developer and developers write](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m57s)

[code so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h55m59s)

[something had an api i can write code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m01s)

[and i went i got this so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m03s)

[naturally what i did is i took](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m06s)

[actually hang on visual aid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m09s)

[total sidebar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m19s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m21s)

[what i did to manage my timesheet](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m22s)

[because that was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m24s)

[that was a little too much effort](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m28s)

[i went through and i bought a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m34s)

[i bought a a little nine key keyboard i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m37s)

[don't know if that's visible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m40s)

[oh some of my keys are green so this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m42s)

[going to be interesting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m44s)

[you can guess which ones are green the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m46s)

[ones that are being chroma keyed out so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m47s)

[i bought this little nine key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m50s)

[i took a 3d printer and printed custom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m52s)

[keycaps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m54s)

[and this little nine keys it's uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m56s)

[programmable so i programmed it to like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h56m59s)

[upper function keys so like f16 on up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m01s)

[or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m05s)

[no f13 on up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m07s)

[and then i used uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m08s)

[auto hotkey to map to map those key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m11s)

[presses into invoking my cli app which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m13s)

[calls toggle to monitor my time entries](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m17s)

[so then when i start work i press button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m19s)

[and when i'm done working i press button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m23s)

[it was a lot of work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m27s)

[to just be able to press a button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m29s)

[and it felt so good when it worked it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m31s)

[felt great um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m33s)

[so anyway but to invoke toggles api you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m36s)

[have to have an api key what a shock](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m39s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m42s)

[obviously i did not check my api key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m43s)

[into this repo you are free to search](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m45s)

[for it it is not there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m47s)

[you'll note this is just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m49s)

[console application it takes it in this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m51s)

[is leveraging something called](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m54s)

[the dragon fruit from system command](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m56s)

[line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m57s)

[and if it's not passed in it'll just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h57m59s)

[pull it off an environment variable and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m00s)

[this worked good except for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m02s)

[i ended up needing to cycle my key may](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m04s)

[have exposed it when i didn't mean to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m07s)

[uh which was fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m09s)

[got it cycled got a new key but then i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m12s)

[had to then go and populate everywhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m14s)

[where it was used and that just didn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m16s)

[work well for me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m18s)

[and so i wanted to have a more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m20s)

[convenient way of sharing that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m22s)

[all of this to say enter key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m27s)

[i started refactoring this to use eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m28s)

[configuration similar to how all this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m30s)

[set up i was like man it'd be really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m32s)

[great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m34s)

[if i had another provider to be able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m35s)

[pull this in because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m37s)

[having a centralized level of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m39s)

[configuration and policy would be great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m41s)

[and i don't want to just expose this key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m43s)

[to anybody i want to be very much in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m45s)

[complete control of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m47s)

[well conveniently azure has a resource](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m49s)

[that's intended to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m51s)

[used](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m53s)

[to monitor secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m55s)

[and not expose them which is awesome so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h58m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m00s)

[i went through to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m01s)

[as soon as i figure out where i put it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m05s)

[on one of my tabs](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m07s)

[i made a key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m10s)

[so this was not fancy this was this was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m13s)

[legitimately me just walking in and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m16s)

[going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m18s)

[okay i need a key vault here i can show](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m19s)

[you what i did](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m22s)

[so create a resource](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m23s)

[we do key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m25s)

[also](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m29s)

[if anybody so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m30s)

[measure the free account i can't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m32s)

[remember if key vault is on the list](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m34s)

[uh was that the azure one nope that's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m38s)

[google's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m40s)

[this is one um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m44s)

[i cannot remember if key vault is in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m46s)

[pre-services list or not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=00h59m50s)

[see all free services that's what i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m03s)

[looking for is key vault in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m05s)

[a b c d e f g key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m08s)

[so it is not permanently free but if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m12s)

[sign up for a free account it's at least](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m15s)

[free for the first 12 months](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m17s)

[uh for 10 000 transactions which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m20s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m25s)

[frankly a lot especially if you're on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m26s)

[something that you're just using](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m28s)

[yourself](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m29s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m30s)

[uh worth noting if you want to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m31s)

[something like this beyond the 12 months](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m34s)

[it will probably cost you something i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m36s)

[can tell you my key vaults that i run](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m37s)

[for things like this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m39s)

[i'm pretty sure my cost is in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m41s)

[pennies but my user base is in the two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m43s)

[digits](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m45s)

[so not exactly a huge](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m47s)

[user base and it's low two digits too i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m49s)

[will say that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m53s)

[uh came in here key vault create](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m54s)

[oh hush now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h00m59s)

[um picked a resource group gave it a key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m00s)

[vault name the one thing to be aware of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m02s)

[because key vaults are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m04s)

[addressable on the internet there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m06s)

[url that gets generated for them which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m08s)

[we'll see in a second um this name has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m10s)

[to be globally unique](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m12s)

[which is why i didn't want to delete and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m14s)

[rename it just in the off chance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m16s)

[somebody else decided to take the name](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m17s)

[color kraken from me while it was not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m19s)

[there so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m21s)

[i kept it once i got it i'm like i'm not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m23s)

[letting go this name it's mine it's mine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m28s)

[i still color cracking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m29s)

[and so this is the url that it ends up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m31s)

[generating for you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m35s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m36s)

[you can set up soft delete](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m38s)

[all that stuff the one thing to note](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m40s)

[here and this is a big change the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m42s)

[default is vault access policy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m45s)

[i do not recommend this one this is this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m48s)

[is the older one the newer one is our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m50s)

[back or roll based access control this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m53s)

[is much nicer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m55s)

[this is typically what you're going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m57s)

[want and that's what i'm going to show](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h01m58s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m00s)

[but we're going to leave because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m02s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m04s)

[well just so networking the other thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m05s)

[is um if you want it accessible via a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m07s)

[public ip address you do need to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m10s)

[explicitly pick that option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m12s)

[you do something else](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m14s)

[it's private and then does not work well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m16s)

[for desktop apps so if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m18s)

[work with desktop apps you do need a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m20s)

[public ip address](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m22s)

[to gain access to it or you have to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m23s)

[front it with something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m25s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m27s)

[but i will leave complicated options up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m30s)

[for other people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m32s)

[so create a key vault and this guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m34s)

[should be in the more or less default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m36s)

[state after you create it and the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m39s)

[key thing i'm going to point out right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m41s)

[away is i'm going to click on secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m42s)

[now this is created underneath](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m44s)

[my azure subscription where i am the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m48s)

[owner](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m50s)

[so i should have unlimited rights to all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m52s)

[the things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m55s)

[but you'll note as an owner i am not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h02m57s)

[authorized to view these contents](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m00s)

[this is both the best and the worst](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m03s)

[thing about key vault key vault is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m05s)

[secure by default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m07s)

[sometimes to a fault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m09s)

[it will not give you access to your own](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m12s)

[stuff unless you explicitly give](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m15s)

[yourself access so as an owner i can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m17s)

[change my access level](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m20s)

[but i don't get it by default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m25s)

[and this is why we picked rather than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m26s)

[the access policies](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m27s)

[you'll note down here we're still using](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m30s)

[it's set to our back](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m32s)

[rather than the vault access policy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m34s)

[our bat gives you also more fine grain](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m36s)

[control as well which is even better](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m39s)

[so we're going to come in here and we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m41s)

[just need to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m43s)

[grant access to this resource so the big](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m44s)

[button that says grant access](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m46s)

[yeah we're gonna click that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m48s)

[um and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m50s)

[at least](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m52s)

[um on the the basic um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m53s)

[aad level tier that i'm on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h03m57s)

[there's a bunch of built-in roles the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m00s)

[more advanced ones you can create custom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m02s)

[roles if you really need to fine-grain](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m03s)

[it better but you'll know there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m05s)

[various different levels](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m06s)

[between who can say read the secrets who](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m09s)

[can add the secrets um who can manage](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m12s)

[the key fall all but not access them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m22s)

[yeah so you'll know a lot of these like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m25s)

[the secrets officer can perform any](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m26s)

[action on the secrets of a key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m28s)

[except manage permissions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m34s)

[the key vault secrets user](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m35s)

[this one can only read secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m37s)

[which is good in my case i'm just going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m40s)

[to go with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m43s)

[let's give me a secrets officer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m44s)

[because my owner permissions will give](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m49s)

[me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m51s)

[well no i want to be able to show the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h04m52s)

[grant access](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m25s)

[you may so i'm going to stall for just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m27s)

[couple moments because occasionally it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m29s)

[does take a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m30s)

[a few minutes to go back](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m32s)

[to come all the way in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m34s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m38s)

[this operation is not allowed by our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m40s)

[role assignments become effective](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m45s)

[they aren't joking about those several](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m47s)

[minutes so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m49s)

[we're going to just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m50s)

[confirm that it does show me as a key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m52s)

[vault administrator and that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m57s)

[yeah perform all data plane operations](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h05m58s)

[i.e manage the data of your certificates](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m01s)

[keys and secrets the secrets are what we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m04s)

[care about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m06s)

[there we go oh i went in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m08s)

[oh well we'll leave it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m10s)

[obviously the permissions are now valid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m14s)

[again because i can now see the secret](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m15s)

[that's in there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m17s)

[but if we wanted to add a secret we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m18s)

[could come in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m20s)

[manual is just the easy way of doing it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m22s)

[and once again these things are just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m23s)

[name value pairs the wonderful part](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m25s)

[about secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m28s)

[is they can be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m29s)

[versioned as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m31s)

[and then if you click on one you can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m33s)

[actually give](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m35s)

[individual access so on a per secret](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m36s)

[basis if you wanted to say i want to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m39s)

[grant somebody access to this secret but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m42s)

[not this other one you can do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m44s)

[which is something you cannot do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m48s)

[with the access policies which is kind](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m50s)

[of nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m52s)

[okay so we've got this guy here so let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m55s)

[go through and let's set up one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h06m57s)

[for hours](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m00s)

[so if we look back at our](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m02s)

[app settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m05s)

[so you know settings value my awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m07s)

[value so we're going to go and create](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m09s)

[this one because i believe where we left](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m11s)

[it is this guy is currently the one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m13s)

[winning](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m16s)

[so super secret local value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m17s)

[which tab am i in there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m23s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m24s)

[and as the other one implied um the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m25s)

[the magical naming scheme for hierarchy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m29s)

[and key vault is the the double hyphen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m31s)

[this one's going to end up being](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m34s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m36s)

[double hyphen value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m40s)

[so if for example i don't have internet](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m41s)

[i won't be able to use your settings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m43s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m45s)

[um and that's one of the things i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m47s)

[going to address here in just a moment](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m49s)

[because this is great for one use case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m51s)

[and horrible for another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m54s)

[and i will let](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m56s)

[you decide so super secret](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h07m58s)

[will do key vault value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m00s)

[we'll just make it different](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m02s)

[you can even have keys expire not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m05s)

[activate until a particular point so if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m07s)

[you know hey i don't want this thing to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m09s)

[become active until x you can do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m11s)

[there's a lot of power here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m14s)

[um okay so we are just going to go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m16s)

[create](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m18s)

[we're going to keep it simple](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m19s)

[okay so let's actually register up this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m22s)

[provider now so down in here we need we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m24s)

[vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m38s)

[b-a-u-l-t if i spell it correctly i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m40s)

[think the auto code can find the nuget](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m43s)

[no it's not that cool okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h08m47s)

[the technology from you on the stream](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m40s)

[ooh so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m42s)

[personally what i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m46s)

[what i have done with it is very limited](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m49s)

[i don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m52s)

[i'd have to do a little prep to be able](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m54s)

[to go through and do best practices um i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h09m56s)

[i do however work with people smart on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m00s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m03s)

[because i have people who know it much](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m18s)

[better than me and that would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m20s)

[potentially be a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m22s)

[better option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m24s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m26s)

[this is what we need microsoft](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m28s)

[extensions configuration azure key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m29s)

[we're going to start there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m32s)

[and add your keyboard there's the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m44s)

[magical method that we want okay and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m46s)

[there are some options in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m48s)

[um and more importantly the first one is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m50s)

[we need a vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m53s)

[so and actually we're going to put azure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m55s)

[key vault at the end](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h10m57s)

[i can't decide yeah we've been we've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m00s)

[been just appending things to the end](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m02s)

[um okay so let's grab](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m04s)

[i need my vault url](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m07s)

[grab my vault uri](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m12s)

[so that goes there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m15s)

[um and i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m19s)

[think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m20s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m25s)

[is not going to work for me out of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m26s)

[gate](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m29s)

[um well let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m30s)

[we're going to fire it up i'm fairly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m33s)

[confident this blows up with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m34s)

[off issues](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m37s)

[but i made a mistake earlier see if i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m41s)

[can do it again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m43s)

[little think think think think think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m52s)

[this is the other reason why it can be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m55s)

[mildly problematic oh look at that is it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m57s)

[just gonna work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h11m58s)

[see i'm wrong again even better](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m02s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m05s)

[how how unfortunate it read the value](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m07s)

[out of the key vault for me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m09s)

[look at that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m14s)

[so that was easy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m17s)

[and there wasn't a lot of thinking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m19s)

[involved now the the reason this works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m20s)

[so i am signed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m25s)

[you misspelled the key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m28s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m31s)

[as the as the lovely old saying goes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m40s)

[in programming i don't have to uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m43s)

[uh spell accurately i just have to spell](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m46s)

[consistently](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m48s)

[usually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m52s)

[but you're right we should go fix that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m53s)

[so this will be a nice nice lesson in uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h12m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m00s)

[you update the versions of your secret](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m22s)

[so because these things are version you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m24s)

[don't just go in and edit it you put in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m26s)

[so now we have a new version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m54s)

[uh worth noting you can't so this url](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m56s)

[here if you ever use like the key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h13m59s)

[so these magical grids are actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m22s)

[useful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m24s)

[so if there's a reason that you want to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m25s)

[pin yourself down to a particular one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m26s)

[that's how you do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m30s)

[okay but the reason this works is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m32s)

[because the account that i am signed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m35s)

[into on my box is the same account that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m37s)

[i have given access to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m39s)

[so the microsoft identity provider knows](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m41s)

[who i am](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m43s)

[on this machine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m45s)

[therefore it is able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m46s)

[connect out into](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m48s)

[azure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m52s)

[because i am logged in locally](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m52s)

[it works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m55s)

[now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m56s)

[that's great let's prove it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h14m57s)

[so we're gonna come in here we're gonna](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m00s)

[and we're just gonna kick me out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m06s)

[because uh where's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m08s)

[remove there we go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m12s)

[now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m19s)

[this is sort of what you were driving at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m20s)

[earlier a little bit justin bieber of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m22s)

[well what if i go offline or something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m24s)

[goes wrong](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m26s)

[apparently i'm not out yet](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m32s)

[give it a moment give it a moment gotta](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m35s)

[gotta get the key vault he did this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m37s)

[earlier it fails i promise](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m39s)

[it doesn't just magically off its way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m41s)

[through](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m43s)

[come on kick me out of the key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m48s)

[there we go that's more like what i was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m50s)

[expected caller not authorized](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m55s)

[so you'll note you will get you will get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h15m57s)

[similar exceptions that bubble up um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m00s)

[obviously it won't be color not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m02s)

[authorized if you are say offline or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m04s)

[whatnot i would throw airplane mode on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m06s)

[to demonstrate that but unfortunately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m08s)

[that would also kill the stream and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m10s)

[that's probably a bad idea trust me 404s](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m11s)

[or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m14s)

[not connect from the internet will do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m16s)

[other things now this is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m17s)

[the drawback to adding in a provider](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m19s)

[that is a remote resource is if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m22s)

[cannot get out there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m25s)

[the provider is going to fail at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m28s)

[point where it's building up the eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m29s)

[configuration and the i configuration is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m31s)

[initialize with this build command here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m36s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m40s)

[create host builder gets the builder](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m40s)

[ready](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m42s)

[the build method actually takes the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m44s)

[builder and says okay builder now build](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m45s)

[the things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m47s)

[the builder goes to build the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m49s)

[configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m50s)

[and when it gets around to key vault it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m51s)

[goes yeah about that boom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m53s)

[and we're done](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m56s)

[which is not great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m57s)

[not great um that is not what we would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h16m59s)

[prefer to have happen so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m02s)

[instead of doing that what would be a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m04s)

[little bit nicer is if we could tell it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m06s)

[hey don't do that now there's a there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m09s)

[a few easy ways we could work around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m11s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m13s)

[so if for example i wanted to just um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m14s)

[limit key vault to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m19s)

[to debug](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m24s)

[just so i could share these between](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m26s)

[machines i could do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m27s)

[um how to do air handling try catch rap](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m29s)

[everything kind of guy ah good question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m35s)

[so yes ish](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m36s)

[and that's actually one thing i haven't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m38s)

[talked about yet the generic host one of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m40s)

[the other wonderful things that it gives](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m42s)

[you is generic logging so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m43s)

[you can have your code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m46s)

[set up to do it so the one thing i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m48s)

[most of the time hate](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m50s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m53s)

[just try catch blocks that suppress](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m54s)

[exceptions that is a great way to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m56s)

[very confused and frustrated at your app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h17m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m01s)

[it's working but it's not working](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m02s)

[something's not right um in general the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m04s)

[idea of fail fast is usually a good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m07s)

[spectacular ways as early as possible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m12s)

[preferred approach now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m17s)

[with that said](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m19s)

[with useful information is the most](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m21s)

[important point of any air um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m22s)

[not necessarily whether it crashes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m25s)

[there's always an evaluation of well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m26s)

[can my app continue reasonably if it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m29s)

[airs at this point sometimes the answer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m32s)

[is yes sometimes it's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m34s)

[um but in general yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m36s)

[try catch](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m40s)

[usually try catch log](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m41s)

[or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m44s)

[try catch append useful information and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m49s)

[in your catch statement or just catch](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m50s)

[the exception and output that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m54s)

[so often times what i will do inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h18m57s)

[uh and actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m00s)

[let me circle back to that just a second](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m03s)

[because we're about to we're about to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m05s)

[handle this key vault air](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m08s)

[so let me let me handle that and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m10s)

[i'll answer that then i think that'll be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m13s)

[a little a little easier so so we could](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m15s)

[wrap this in a nip debug and just tell](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m17s)

[developers on on the app hey hey do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m19s)

[um what i would actually prefer to do is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m22s)

[tell it you know what if you don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m24s)

[because not everybody's going to have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m26s)

[access to azure keep all more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m28s)

[importantly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m29s)

[if you aren't me or somebody i've added](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m30s)

[to my subscription you aren't going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m32s)

[have access to my keyboard](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m34s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m36s)

[this is great for some of us and not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m37s)

[great for others](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m39s)

[but the idea eventually is so grand](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m40s)

[aspirations is that this app eventually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m43s)

[kind of has a means of people to be able](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m46s)

[to share their themes amongst each other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m47s)

[which would be great but that requires](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m50s)

[things like auth because i'm not going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m52s)

[to let that work unoff that sounds](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m53s)

[horrible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m55s)

[and some way to manage that data because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h19m58s)

[i i could easily see people using it and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m01s)

[then just blowing up my azure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m03s)

[subscription that also sounds bad so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m04s)

[we're going to not let that happen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m07s)

[um which is why i want to start building](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m10s)

[out some some back end bits for this app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m12s)

[along with key vault and sequence so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m15s)

[that's long term where i'm thinking of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m17s)

[going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m19s)

[but this for for now what we need to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m20s)

[is handle the failure when we don't have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m22s)

[access to keyboard because that will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m24s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m26s)

[so if we take a look at what this method](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m27s)

[is doing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m29s)

[and just control click in so visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m30s)

[studio 2022 i believe uses the same sdk](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m33s)

[as il spy so the same thing as this guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m36s)

[for getting your decompiled source](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m39s)

[so you don't know this one just calls](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m42s)

[the overload that pat so for whatever](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m43s)

[reason this thing here is not landing on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m46s)

[the right overload](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m48s)

[because that shows three parameters and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m50s)

[i see one getting past so that's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m52s)

[right so this one lands here it hits the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m53s)

[options overload which is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m56s)

[this bottom one down here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h20m58s)

[and if we look at this bottom one down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m00s)

[here we can see this does a bunch of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m02s)

[stuff but ultimately at the end of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m04s)

[day all it's doing is calling](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m05s)

[configuration builder add](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m07s)

[and then specifically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m10s)

[this internal uh class this eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m12s)

[configuration source is really just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m15s)

[single method so this whole](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m16s)

[this whole extension method is just a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m19s)

[means of calling add to add in one of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m21s)

[these guys](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m24s)

[and this guy ultimately adds in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m25s)

[provider and this is what's doing a lot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m26s)

[of the work in terms of of building this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m28s)

[stuff up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m31s)

[so what we would like to do and we we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m32s)

[can look at this provider](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m34s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m37s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m41s)

[and if we](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m43s)

[i'm saving you the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m44s)

[bunny rabbit follow this is where it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m46s)

[ends up going so the load method is what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m48s)

[um does the work but load](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m51s)

[legitimately just calls into load async](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m54s)

[as you can see this is their](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m57s)

[unfortunate way of turning an async call](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h21m59s)

[into synchronous](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m01s)

[um doing the best](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m03s)

[possible way they can that they try to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m05s)

[do to avoid dead locks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m07s)

[not perfect but probably close enough](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m09s)

[this is the scary part with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m11s)

[this type of code inside of a desktop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m13s)

[app because that's where deadlocks can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m16s)

[occur](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m18s)

[but in this case i believe they're safe](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m19s)

[just by virtue of usage um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m22s)

[anyway we call into this load secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m25s)

[and the key part here is it calls in and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m27s)

[says okay let's get all of the secrets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m29s)

[let's iterate through all of them let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m31s)

[do some stuff let's add them let's build](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m33s)

[them up and set all of these so it does](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m35s)

[a whole bunch of spin multiple tasks go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m37s)

[read all the secrets pull in all the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m40s)

[configuration from the key vault great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m41s)

[that's that's what we want this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m43s)

[ultimately the the call that's ending up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m46s)

[failing so if we were to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h22m48s)

[keyword does when it recompiles your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h23m32s)

[couple of videos back or i should say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h23m47s)

[it'll come on i promise um so this load](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h23m54s)

[async ultimately if we want to do a try](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h23m58s)

[catch this is what we want to wrap](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m00s)

[the problem is is our injection point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m02s)

[isn't going to be there there's not a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m05s)

[great one built up here because we can't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m07s)

[try catch as part of the builder because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m09s)

[this is setting it up not actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m12s)

[running at it because the running of it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m14s)

[is happening in this build and we don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m17s)

[want to just try catch the entire build](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m19s)

[because we ultimately need the i host to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m22s)

[get built what we'd like to do is on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m24s)

[key vault provider grab just that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m27s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m31s)

[replay it and say if there's any air](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m32s)

[with the key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m34s)

[let's just ignore we don't care let's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m35s)

[let's get rid of it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m37s)

[so what we are going to do is we are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m41s)

[going to replace](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m43s)

[this code here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m45s)

[so let's we're going to start with this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m46s)

[because you'll know this class here is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m48s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m50s)

[which is unfortunate because we need it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m51s)

[so we're going to grab it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m52s)

[and we are just going to copy pasta that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m55s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m58s)

[yeah so stop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h24m59s)

[uh why are you not file scoped](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m01s)

[filescript namespace thank you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m03s)

[thank you okay so we will make our own](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m06s)

[class and we will call it i just want to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m08s)

[disambiguate a little bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m11s)

[we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m13s)

[bring in you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m15s)

[i think that gets me most of the way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m18s)

[there i need to put the word my in front](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m19s)

[of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m21s)

[and that should fix that should fix that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m23s)

[i'm going to move you to your own file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m27s)

[so i don't think about you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m29s)

[and then down here and then what is your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m32s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m35s)

[uh providers inaccessible of course it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m38s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m40s)

[your key vault configuration](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m47s)

[provider oh really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m52s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m57s)

[really really unfortunate](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h25m59s)

[oh you are going to be a pain in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m04s)

[neck aren't you um because i would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m06s)

[really really like to derive from you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m09s)

[how did i do this earlier](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m11s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m14s)

[i got access to you earlier and i went](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m18s)

[oh did i go through a different nuget](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m20s)

[package is that what i did wrong](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m22s)

[i'm cheating i have i have sample code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m25s)

[which is which is the the proper way to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m29s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m34s)

[what did i do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m36s)

[i wrote my own configuration provider to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m38s)

[get me into here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m41s)

[because ultimately all i needed was this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m43s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m47s)

[but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m47s)

[you are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m49s)

[unfortunately going to be problematic](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m50s)

[for me aren't you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m53s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m58s)

[let's see here so then if i don't get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h26m59s)

[access to that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m01s)

[i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m09s)

[really just want to pull from you don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m10s)

[i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m11s)

[let me just look because i think you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m14s)

[a pretty simple](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m16s)

[we might we might end up having to wrap](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m18s)

[this in a fun and a fun way to get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m20s)

[around this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m22s)

[keyboard client wrapper i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m23s)

[oh we could get in this way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m28s)

[ah we could go in this way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m32s)

[and get it with the key vault client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m36s)

[perhaps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m37s)

[i'm trying to see what my code did](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m39s)

[before and i think the difference is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m41s)

[don't tell me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m46s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m55s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m57s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h27m58s)

[i pulled an older nougat package earlier](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m00s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m06s)

[that's exciting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m09s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m11s)

[exciting let's see options client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m12s)

[i think what we can do is get at it a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m16s)

[slightly different way because we can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m18s)

[come at it from here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m20s)

[i believe and wrap it there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m23s)

[that should work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m29s)

[because that comes in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m32s)

[from key vault client i assume you get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m34s)

[defaulted](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m37s)

[let's see keyword secret manager gets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m40s)

[set in a constructor](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m42s)

[i'm just finding my way through these uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m45s)

[keyboard client please don't be sealed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m49s)

[i think that's all i need](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h28m56s)

[i would just like to wrap you up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m03s)

[this provider is just doing a wrapper](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m06s)

[and the rapper is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m09s)

[assume public](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m14s)

[interesting why do you not give me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m20s)

[another injection point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m22s)

[so one other thing i will call out that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m27s)

[i didn't show earlier was a lot of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m28s)

[providers do have the uh the the eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m30s)

[options interface is only one way of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m33s)

[getting these values backed out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m35s)

[you know you'll note that this key vault](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m37s)

[has a reload interval](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m38s)

[because once your app is running](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m40s)

[quite often you don't want the app to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m43s)

[just stick with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m45s)

[the configuration value that it was at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m46s)

[startup it would be nice if that would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m48s)

[refresh as things changed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m51s)

[at least within some reasonable interval](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m53s)

[that's exactly what this is for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m55s)

[so if you want your app effectively](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m57s)

[pulling key vault on some interval to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h29m59s)

[check for updated values](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m02s)

[that's the thing there um similar things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m04s)

[with the file providers they can use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m06s)

[watchers to watch for when your your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m07s)

[json files change and automatically um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m09s)

[update](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m12s)

[the key part is your code beyond eye](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m13s)

[options needs to leverage](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m16s)

[uh what is it so there's eye option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m18s)

[snapshot which will give you a snapshot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m20s)

[in time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m22s)

[um i believe i options uh based upon](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m23s)

[when you call the dot value that's when](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m27s)

[it's actually going to to read it so as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m29s)

[long as you are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m31s)

[repopulating](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m33s)

[um and not caching the result of that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m35s)

[dot value call you should be fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m37s)

[this may end up being a little more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m42s)

[complicated okay so before i run down a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m43s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m52s)

[i should say is a generalized rule with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m53s)

[right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h30m58s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m00s)

[there are a few there are a few common](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m01s)

[things that i see happen all the time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m04s)

[that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m06s)

[that people should should not do so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m07s)

[in general if you are going you should](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m10s)

[only catch exceptions that you actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m12s)

[intend to handle](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m16s)

[and there and i use handle kind of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m17s)

[loosely because there's a couple ways](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m19s)

[that that can be interpreted so one is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m21s)

[you catch the exception and you actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m24s)

[um do something with it um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m27s)

[for example](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m30s)

[and i'm i'm intentionally not using](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m32s)

[logging here uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m33s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m35s)

[perhaps i know that uh an io exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m36s)

[in in some particular context is fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m39s)

[and we just need to suppress it now it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m42s)

[could be any number of reasons we've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m44s)

[lost access the folder got deleted](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m46s)

[something's wrong right the path doesn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m48s)

[exist i know that i o exceptions it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m50s)

[like okay i get it the thing is not the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m52s)

[file i was going to read is not there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m55s)

[let's just move on we couldn't get it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m57s)

[don't really care what the reason was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h31m59s)

[i my app can keep working without](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m01s)

[reading some file sure great that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m03s)

[perfectly fine as a way of suppressing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m05s)

[uh an exception that works](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m08s)

[um the one thing that is generally](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m11s)

[frowned upon is generalized catch blocks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m14s)

[which are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m16s)

[catch all exceptions and worth noting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m17s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m19s)

[um in latest versions of she's sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m20s)

[identical](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m22s)

[as just catching everything there used](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m24s)

[to be some some minor differences with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m26s)

[unmanaged code those are no longer the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m28s)

[case in latest versions of c sure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m30s)

[the other thing that you should never](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m32s)

[ever ever do is this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m34s)

[so and you'll know the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m36s)

[the analyzers in visual studio 2022 are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m38s)

[already even flagging it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m41s)

[saying rethrowing the cod exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m43s)

[changes the stack information because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m45s)

[the moment you do throw exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m47s)

[this is valid for the case of when you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m49s)

[do throw new exception or similar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m51s)

[because this is what ends up setting the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m54s)

[stack trace on the exception object](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m56s)

[if you re-throw a cod exception that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h32m58s)

[re-does the stack trace](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m02s)

[throwing away the original one so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m05s)

[useful things that you can do in here is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m07s)

[for example if i catch the exception but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m10s)

[it's like you know what catching this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m12s)

[not useful i know something about the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m13s)

[current context so maybe i decide i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m16s)

[going to wrap this up in an i o](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m18s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m20s)

[or sure an invalid operation exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m23s)

[the one thing that you can do is i can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m25s)

[say you know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m28s)

[useful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m29s)

[message with more context](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m30s)

[so if for whatever reason i know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m33s)

[something about the context maybe i know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m35s)

[that i'm reading a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m38s)

[a file line right and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m41s)

[that there wrap it up um i do a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m43s)

[catch-all when using multiple libraries](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m46s)

[that i'm not from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m47s)

[familiar with i usually don't care about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m49s)

[errors in production only in debug and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m51s)

[that that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m53s)

[probably fair](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m56s)

[the the hard part with exceptions is by](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h33m58s)

[definition they're exceptional](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m01s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m03s)

[they really have to be evaluated on a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m05s)

[case-by-case basis](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m07s)

[and so yeah suppressing things that come](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m08s)

[out of libraries that the library is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m10s)

[going to throw and your app can continue](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m12s)

[on reasonably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m14s)

[in the face of a library uh some call](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m16s)

[failing that's fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m19s)

[it really does depend on can your app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m21s)

[continue on reasonably if some call](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m24s)

[fails](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m26s)

[and the answer is i don't know it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m28s)

[depends it really depends a lot on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m30s)

[context](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m32s)

[but if i'm going to catch an exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m33s)

[it should it should be to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m36s)

[to either append useful information and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m38s)

[by append by](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m41s)

[by usually wrapping it up in another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m43s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m45s)

[the other thing that is usually a big](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m48s)

[no-no](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m50s)

[is uh doing something like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m51s)

[pretend like console writeline is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m55s)

[reasonable log method](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m56s)

[generally console output is not how you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h34m59s)

[want to log your exceptions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m03s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m05s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m06s)

[this is also generally a bad idea](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m08s)

[of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m10s)

[log the exception and re-throw it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m12s)

[this is usually a what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m14s)

[um if you because in this case you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m17s)

[aren't actually handling it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m21s)

[you are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m24s)

[you're logging it and then rethrowing it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m25s)

[and typically what will happen is either](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m27s)

[that exception will get thrown all the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m29s)

[way up to the next catch block or all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m31s)

[the way out and bring down the app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m33s)

[and at the point where it brings down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m36s)

[the app at least in windows like your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m37s)

[event viewer is going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m39s)

[log something for it or depending on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m41s)

[what framework you're in it may log](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m43s)

[something for it and so this additional](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m45s)

[log](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m48s)

[is actually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m49s)

[duplicating and usually showing less](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m53s)

[information because it's further down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m55s)

[the stack](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m57s)

[than what the higher up one is going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h35m58s)

[do so in general if you catch an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m00s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m02s)

[don't just log in rethrow that isn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m03s)

[necessarily a handle](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m05s)

[always make sure that you're you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m08s)

[either](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m10s)

[like if you're going to catch and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m11s)

[rethrow make sure you're like a pending](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m12s)

[more contextual information that's great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m14s)

[please do that um i told some colleagues](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m17s)

[the other day please write the error](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m19s)

[message that you want to read](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m21s)

[because i i got some really bad error](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m23s)

[messages coming up at me and i'm like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m26s)

[really really really really really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m29s)

[really frustrating](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m32s)

[console writeline](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m33s)

[ee message](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m36s)

[wait what's the overload do there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m38s)

[i don't remember what the second](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m41s)

[overload to console rightland](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m48s)

[wait what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m49s)

[is that hitting just the format overload](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m54s)

[i assume you must be in something like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m57s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h36m59s)

[uh i don't know syntax](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m00s)

[yeah so something like this in general](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m04s)

[don't worry about it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m06s)

[uh the only reason i question it on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m08s)

[console writeline is the overloads are a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m10s)

[little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m11s)

[without intellisense uh intellisense is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m12s)

[making all of us dumber it's like speed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m15s)

[phone numbers anymore](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m18s)

[that that's what's happening to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m20s)

[programming we've we're slowly getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m21s)

[this is another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m28s)

[this is just a weird one because this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m29s)

[effectively a string format call and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m30s)

[because these things won't be format](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m32s)

[strings you probably don't need both](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m34s)

[again i'd probably have to see usage](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m41s)

[because that's gonna end up doing a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m42s)

[replacement with uh you know like your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h37m44s)

[freakishly accurate um i i mentioned](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m35s)

[last week on stream that uh some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m37s)

[colleagues teach at a local university](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m39s)

[i've been helping out and i was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m42s)

[teaching somebody some c sharp and it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m45s)

[really unfortunate because i was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m47s)

[explaining okay you know do this and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m49s)

[then this is what happens they hit enter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m50s)

[to drop down to the next line and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m53s)

[intellisense just populated the whole](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m54s)

[line it's like really really you're not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m56s)

[going to make him learn anything you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h38m59s)

[just going to hand it to him okay fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m00s)

[yes that's the right answer hit tab](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m06s)

[let's see console.writeline e get base](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m09s)

[exception to string helps a lot if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m12s)

[have a really big hierarchy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m15s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m17s)

[e dot get basic section do you mean](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m19s)

[flatten hierarchy because there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m21s)

[uh oh get based no look at that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m30s)

[oh i see oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m32s)

[it's the root cause yes so this will get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m33s)

[you um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m36s)

[so like when you rethrow like this where](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m37s)

[you're setting the inner exception this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m39s)

[happens a lot in the libraries all the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m41s)

[way down so get base exception is going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m43s)

[to go to your innermost if you there is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m46s)

[one on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m48s)

[uh is it aggregate exception i think has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m50s)

[a flattened hierarchy as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m52s)

[flat](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m55s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m56s)

[this can be this can be helpful so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h39m59s)

[there's a few different exception types](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m00s)

[that have little helpers like this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m02s)

[which can be quite handy specifically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m05s)

[for logging don't do it just for the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m07s)

[fun of it because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m10s)

[it's work that doesn't need to be done](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m13s)

[if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m14s)

[write cs code in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m15s)

[bsc you can use copilot yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m17s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m21s)

[um i've i actually started um using a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m22s)

[lot more um visual studio code for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m26s)

[generalized development um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m31s)

[mostly because i was working in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m34s)

[a very large solution](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m42s)

[the other thing and i'm just gonna show](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m44s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m46s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m50s)

[okay i can't go the entire time without](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m51s)

[talking about get cracking so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m53s)

[uh where's codelines](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h40m55s)

[i already have it installed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m01s)

[must](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m03s)

[alright install coldness](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m05s)

[is it the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m36s)

[copy extension id let me see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m40s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m41s)

[there is a share button](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m43s)

[install another version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m45s)

[where is it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m47s)

[they hide it at the bottom of the readme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m50s)

[or something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m51s)

[new studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m53s)

[now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m56s)

[there is well when in doubt](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h41m57s)

[there we are that'll work boom there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m01s)

[link](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m04s)

[so get lenses bought by get kraken](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m06s)

[and there was a question they had on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m10s)

[their twitter the other day about you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m11s)

[know what do people want to know about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m13s)

[it or or what was the thing it was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m15s)

[something like what it what did you wish](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m17s)

[you knew when you started with it or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m18s)

[something like that and i was like i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m19s)

[haven't even installed it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m21s)

[i wouldn't installed it it's pretty nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m23s)

[it's pretty nice so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m25s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m27s)

[uh let's see make sure to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m30s)

[do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m32s)

[sorry i missed some context](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m33s)

[aggregate has flattened](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m40s)

[oh yes so the yeah so the question about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m42s)

[this subtle difference between throw and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m46s)

[throw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m48s)

[throw e yeah i i kind of skimmed over it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m49s)

[very quickly um but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m53s)

[the the key difference here is so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m54s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m57s)

[the two lines](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h42m59s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m02s)

[good this one bad um and so the the key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m03s)

[difference is the moment you do throw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m07s)

[space](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m10s)

[exception instance so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m14s)

[yeah so similar to what we did here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m15s)

[because new exception instance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m17s)

[this sets the stack trace of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m20s)

[exception object and building up that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m22s)

[stack trace is actually kind of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m24s)

[expensive it's the most expensive part](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m25s)

[of well not the most expensive it's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m27s)

[fairly expensive part of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m29s)

[of throwing exceptions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m32s)

[which is why you should not use them for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m34s)

[normal control flow exceptions should be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m35s)

[for exceptional cases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m37s)

[but if you do if you catch an exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m41s)

[and re-throw it like this what you've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m43s)

[done is you've replaced the original](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m45s)

[stack trace with a stack trace that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m47s)

[starts from right here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m49s)

[so you've thrown away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m51s)

[all the useful stuff well not the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m53s)

[all the useful stuff you've thrown away](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m55s)

[arguably what i consider to be the most](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m57s)

[useful part of an exception which is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h43m58s)

[where did it come from how did i get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m01s)

[there like that the stack trace i love](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m03s)

[stack traces i love debugging from them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m05s)

[i'm weird](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m07s)

[i don't know why i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m09s)

[i actually enjoy when i get bug reports](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m10s)

[that are just hey here's the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m12s)

[from the logs figure out what happened](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m14s)

[and i love that kind of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m16s)

[you know almost deductive reasoning of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m19s)

[well it had to have done this because of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m22s)

[this and it got here because of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m24s)

[sometimes there's not enough information](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m26s)

[but i love it when you can kind of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m27s)

[deduce your way all the way into a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m28s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m30s)

[love that feeling](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m31s)

[this here will properly rethrow the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m33s)

[exception without rewriting the stack](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m36s)

[trace](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m38s)

[and i'm a little surprised because when](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m40s)

[i did this the first time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m43s)

[i thought](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m45s)

[oh it must have been when i did this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m47s)

[yeah there it is okay um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m50s)

[it's surprising to me that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m54s)

[this one appropriately flags](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h44m57s)

[and this doesn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m02s)

[i'm a little surprised at that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m07s)

[um but at least in this particular case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m09s)

[it is appropriately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m12s)

[the the code analysis is flagging it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m14s)

[saying hey](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m16s)

[this is a bad idea um so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m17s)

[in general you should almost never do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m19s)

[throw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m22s)

[um exception instance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m23s)

[except in the case when you when you are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m26s)

[first newing up the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m28s)

[that's the general case of the only time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m31s)

[it's acceptable to do throw exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m33s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m36s)

[um is when you're first doing it because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m37s)

[you kind of somebody has to do the first](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m38s)

[throw somewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m40s)

[ooh default theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m44s)

[i like i said](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m48s)

[small confession point um vs code for a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m50s)

[long time has been my um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m54s)

[text editor of choice and i i honestly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h45m58s)

[have not used it for a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m01s)

[development um recent project i was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m02s)

[doing a lot of sre related work so a lot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m05s)

[of powershell scripting um and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m07s)

[i started to get myself back into it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m11s)

[more though](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m13s)

[the one thing i i will say vs code has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m15s)

[absolutely rocked on that visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m18s)

[is only slowly catching up on is their](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m20s)

[multi-cursor support](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m22s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m24s)

[awesome um i had a colleague start](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m24s)

[teaching me a lot of the the shortcuts](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m26s)

[and how to use the multi-cursors](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m29s)

[effectively oh my word it is amazing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m33s)

[i wish visual studio was up on that part](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m38s)

[uh exceptions and asynchronous methods](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m40s)

[are also handled differently aren't they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m44s)

[yes but i'll put a little star next to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m46s)

[it so if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m48s)

[if you have done](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m51s)

[the async keyword on your method](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m52s)

[um and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m55s)

[uh and properly awaited all of your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m57s)

[asyncs all the way down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h46m59s)

[the exceptions bubble up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m02s)

[from your perspective in the exact same](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m04s)

[way as if it was all synchronous](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m09s)

[which is actually kind of complicated](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m11s)

[when you think about it considering each](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m12s)

[of those asynchronous methods were okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m14s)

[this ran on something else then came](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m16s)

[back this ran over here came back it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m18s)

[moves around a lot the async and await](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m20s)

[state machines keep track of that and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m23s)

[that's one of the things that they do is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m25s)

[make your exceptions bubble up nicely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m26s)

[for you so they bubble up as though they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m28s)

[were](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m31s)

[uh synchronous and normal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m32s)

[and you don't have to think about it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m34s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m36s)

[um the one case that's really important](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m37s)

[to keep track of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m40s)

[um so specifically because we are in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m41s)

[um wpfe land](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m45s)

[um i think we got rid of them don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m48s)

[think we had them in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m50s)

[so cases where you might do so for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m51s)

[example um where you have like a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m54s)

[task.run](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m56s)

[uh you want to be careful because you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m57s)

[can actually end up having exceptions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h47m59s)

[get swallowed](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m01s)

[when you have them spun off in different](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m04s)

[things because when an exception bubbles](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m06s)

[up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m08s)

[there's only a couple options when it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m09s)

[gets to the top it can either be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m11s)

[swallowed or bring down your application](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m19s)

[for things like oh here here we've got a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m20s)

[good one async void](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m22s)

[in the cases of like async void](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m24s)

[or task.run you want to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m28s)

[explicit and make sure that you are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m31s)

[handling those exceptions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m32s)

[because oftentimes those ones will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m34s)

[bubble up they'll hit the top they'll](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m36s)

[jump to the global exception handler and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m39s)

[at that point your app is crashing the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m40s)

[global exception handler is mostly there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m42s)

[as a means for you to log it before you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m44s)

[go down because you're you're going down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m47s)

[so it worth noting that that is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m50s)

[something that that's worth to do uh it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m53s)

[seems they rap in inner exception um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m56s)

[it can it it depends a little bit on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h48m58s)

[your call stack on how things are going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m01s)

[to get wrapped but so for example uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m03s)

[where's in a wait i've gotten to wait in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m06s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m08s)

[uh so theme manager safety so for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m09s)

[example if we do try](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m11s)

[all right catch](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m16s)

[exception e and then we'll just we will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m18s)

[properly rethrow because we will be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m21s)

[good little citizens and if we jump in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m24s)

[here go to implementation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m28s)

[um we're gonna actually go so you'll](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m30s)

[know this is a callback delegate inside](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m32s)

[of here we're just gonna throw new](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m34s)

[exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m38s)

[something like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m43s)

[and then i'm going to go and turn off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m44s)

[you off i'll have to come back to that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m51s)

[key vault thing because i do want to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m52s)

[wrap it in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m53s)

[exception handler](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h49m56s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m00s)

[pretty you for the moment and then this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m03s)

[should start](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m05s)

[so we should be able to see this happen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m09s)

[so this is anytime the brush gets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m11s)

[updated so we'll just go and update a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m13s)

[brush real quick and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m15s)

[oh right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m19s)

[don't need you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m23s)

[launch and go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m31s)

[and i don't know why this breakpoint is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m36s)

[here so we're gonna get rid of it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m41s)

[so if we go and update a brush](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m43s)

[it should blow up rather than update](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m46s)

[apply](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m49s)

[okay so you'll note we caught the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m50s)

[exception here and in this particular](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m52s)

[case uh let's see if we grab our locals](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m55s)

[so you'll know this is actually not even](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h50m58s)

[wrapped in an inner exception so i've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m01s)

[got just a regular system exception the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m03s)

[the message on it is in fact the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m06s)

[this this or i'm sorry](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m09s)

[oh look at that nope it is wrapped in an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m12s)

[inner exception but i think this one is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m14s)

[me because i'm pretty sure both of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m16s)

[yeah so you'll know inner exception misa](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m19s)

[going boom outer exception is air](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m20s)

[writing theme file and i'm pretty sure](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m23s)

[that just means i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m26s)

[appropriately wrapped an exception so in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m28s)

[right theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m30s)

[oh look at that i did do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m32s)

[so in right theme i catch the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m35s)

[from the callback](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m38s)

[but this is being thrown inside of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m39s)

[callback from here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m41s)

[so this exception throws gets caught](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m43s)

[here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m46s)

[gets uh wrapped as an inner exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m47s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m53s)

[rethrown](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m54s)

[this bubbles all the way up back to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h51m57s)

[here where it is caught and we can then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m00s)

[take a look at it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m03s)

[in general it won't be wrapped in an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m06s)

[inner exception unless something does it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m08s)

[but there are a lot of things that do do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m12s)

[it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m14s)

[it is very possible depending on which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m18s)

[apis you're going through that things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m19s)

[will get wrapped up um like for example](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m21s)

[if you do a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m23s)

[a wait on like a task when all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m27s)

[because that has a that's a fan out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m29s)

[approach where there's going to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m32s)

[multiple tasks executing any number of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m34s)

[those could be throwing exceptions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m36s)

[those ones you'll often see get wrapped](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m39s)

[up in like an aggregate exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m41s)

[in an effort to bubble those things up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m44s)

[that way so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m47s)

[that api is going to most likely throw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m48s)

[aggregate exceptions back at you not the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m51s)

[actual original exception that was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m53s)

[thrown so it does depend a lot on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m55s)

[the call stacks of those whether they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m57s)

[get wrapped up the nice part though once](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h52m58s)

[again stack trace what i view is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m01s)

[most important thing ever](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m03s)

[is i can see exactly where these things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m06s)

[came from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m08s)

[so i can tell at the the current point](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m09s)

[that i'm at i am in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m11s)

[updated received](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m13s)

[but i can also know that oh this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m15s)

[exception was thrown inside of the right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m17s)

[theme method](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m19s)

[down on theme manager line 171](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m21s)

[so i have line numbers because this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m24s)

[my code and the symbols files was able](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m25s)

[to resolve it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m28s)

[and i can figure out what method i was](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m30s)

[in and even without the line number](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m32s)

[quite often you can start to figure out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m34s)

[based on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m36s)

[the exception details so usually the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m37s)

[type of exception in the message](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m39s)

[and the method i can usually get pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m42s)

[close as to what happened](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m44s)

[maybe not why it happened but usually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m47s)

[what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m49s)

[what is usually pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m50s)

[pretty easy to figure out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m51s)

[but then we can go to the inner](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m53s)

[exception say okay well we know we know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m54s)

[that one happened and so this one has a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m57s)

[much shorter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h53m59s)

[stack trace because this was done in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m00s)

[callback of save theme](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m03s)

[so you can kind of start to define that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m05s)

[it was done in a callback because of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m07s)

[this prefix here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m09s)

[a lot of the when the compiler generates](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m12s)

[code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m14s)

[oftentimes when you see these angle](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m16s)

[braces the reason it does that is so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m17s)

[that the stuff that it generates doesn't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m19s)

[accidentally have a name collision with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m21s)

[some of your code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m23s)

[because outside of you doing something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m25s)

[really really interesting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m27s)

[this is invalid c-sharp syntax](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m29s)

[it's valid il but it's invalid c-sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m32s)

[so it's really hard for you to already](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m35s)

[have a method with this name on it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m37s)

[because it's invalid c-sharp syntax](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m40s)

[so it means that the compiler is pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m42s)

[safe that it's not going to accidentally](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m44s)

[name collide so it just as long as it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m46s)

[makes sure it doesn't name collide with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m48s)

[itself](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m49s)

[it's golden](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m50s)

[so but because this one was thrown from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m53s)

[save theme down on 134 was caught in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m55s)

[very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m57s)

[next method in right theme right above](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h54m58s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m00s)

[and then that one wrapped the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m02s)

[and popped it up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m04s)

[and so we can just between those two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m05s)

[this real quick and make sure but i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m26s)

[added](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m34s)

[um but i i would like to add something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m35s)

[like this because again my my long term](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m37s)

[i'd like to have the separation between](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m49s)

[because if i allow people to upload](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m54s)

[their own themes i also want to be able](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m56s)

[to have admins that can say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h55m58s)

[which is setting up a key vault client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m25s)

[i'm kind of just wondering if i could](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m27s)

[grab this options class wrap the key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m37s)

[my brain goes this would just be so much](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m42s)

[easier on a website i know i know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m44s)

[you're not wrong there's there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m48s)

[long-standing debate um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m49s)

[about you know are desktop apps dead](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m52s)

[should everything just move to the web](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m55s)

[and usually my standard answer is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m57s)

[desktop apps aren't dead um the web has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h56m58s)

[just greatly expanded what its](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m01s)

[capabilities and so it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m04s)

[quickly going through and building stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m06s)

[out um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m08s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m10s)

[which is which is totally fine i i get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m13s)

[it the like the only advantage my little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m15s)

[wpf app has over um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m18s)

[a web-based one is some of its file](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m22s)

[interaction stuff but even then there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m24s)

[a there's another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m27s)

[i don't know where i saw that url](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m30s)

[there's another get cracking ambassador](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m32s)

[who's actually building a very similar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m33s)

[app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m35s)

[as a website](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m36s)

[and specifically on his he's already got](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m39s)

[a um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m42s)

[kind of like a gallery view where people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m43s)

[can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m46s)

[compost things and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m46s)

[download download different ones that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m48s)

[they want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m50s)

[which is cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m51s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m55s)

[very cool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m56s)

[but i also like thick client apps so i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h57m59s)

[have to build something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m01s)

[um oh hello hang on this is used going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m03s)

[straight to an http client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m06s)

[and that's usually the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m20s)

[the argument for better](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m22s)

[better utilization of hardware is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m24s)

[usually i think right now where people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m26s)

[end up drawing the line between do i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m28s)

[build a website or do i build a desktop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m30s)

[because if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m34s)

[for example there's a project um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m35s)

[i did a lot of work on with my company](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m39s)

[that does um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m41s)

[like video editing type stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m43s)

[um and that's one that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m46s)

[though there's a desire to put some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m48s)

[components of it in the web](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m50s)

[it really has to remain a desktop app](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m52s)

[for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m55s)

[at least the foreseeable future](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m56s)

[um there's just no way that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h58m58s)

[web-based stuff like when you start](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m00s)

[throwing in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m03s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m04s)

[40 gig video files](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m05s)

[it's it's just going to fall over](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m08s)

[uh as a web based one versus something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m10s)

[that has a lot better control of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m13s)

[hardware so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m15s)

[things like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m17s)

[i don't foresee](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m19s)

[ever changing especially being a desktop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m21s)

[app we can do things like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m23s)

[take advantage of gpu and coding and all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m25s)

[kinds of other fun stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m27s)

[so it there's certain areas where it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m32s)

[where you definitely just need where you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m34s)

[do need it but the web](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m37s)

[for what most people do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m40s)

[which is a lot of like enterprise move](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m42s)

[data around stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m43s)

[it's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m46s)

[advanced stuff which is why i think the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m47s)

[web has taken over so much space](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m49s)

[uh to data find but still would have to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m52s)

[make a desktop app in the back yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=01h59m55s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m00s)

[sorry the only thing i'm i'm noticing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m02s)

[here is there is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m04s)

[i'm noticing they exposed the http](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m07s)

[client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m09s)

[um and i know a thing or two about an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m12s)

[http client and i'm just trying to see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m14s)

[if there's a clean way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m16s)

[because all i want to do is grab the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m18s)

[exception from it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m19s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m25s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m26s)

[there she is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m30s)

[there's the message handlers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m37s)

[okay so do you expose a clean way for me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m42s)

[to just set a message handler](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m45s)

[i'm a little annoyed that my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m47s)

[my sample that i put together that i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m50s)

[thought i was going to show is on such](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m51s)

[an old nougat version otherwise i would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m52s)

[just show it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m54s)

[it's just on it's on a old enough](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m57s)

[version i don't think i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h00m59s)

[i don't want somebody seeing that code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m01s)

[and doing something stupid like copying](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m02s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m05s)

[because the options class here only](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m07s)

[exposes me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m09s)

[the client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m11s)

[so i can get access to one of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m14s)

[and this guy itself is going to here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m18s)

[let's just do this from the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m20s)

[do this from the other side rather than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m22s)

[coming at it this way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m25s)

[i just what was the options i want one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m27s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m29s)

[if i go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m34s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m40s)

[for fun](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m40s)

[it is possible to make this code compile](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m43s)

[don't do it but it's possible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h01m49s)

[this video](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m41s)

[so shameless plug if you want to know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m45s)

[how to make that code compile](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m46s)

[there's the link](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m50s)

[don't recommend it that video is pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m53s)

[much a conglomerate of how many bad ways](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m55s)

[can i just horrendously abuse c sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h02m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m01s)

[filled with me giggling which is another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m05s)

[good reason to avoid it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m07s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m08s)

[there's the fault there's the reload](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m12s)

[interval there's the client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m14s)

[and then on here what i would really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m16s)

[love to do is manipulate your underlying](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m19s)

[http](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m21s)

[client crypt with http](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m26s)

[there's the handlers there's the http](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m39s)

[client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m41s)

[oh i just it's so close it's so close so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m42s)

[http client you can get access um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m46s)

[under the hood to it to its handlers but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m51s)

[you do it through its constructor](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m54s)

[um there's a great uh let's see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h03m56s)

[there is a great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m05s)

[blog that i had on doing so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m07s)

[which is why i'm looking to see if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m11s)

[there's an easy way into this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m13s)

[um because i could grab oh man it's so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m15s)

[close it's so close](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m18s)

[sign in with http messages a sync](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m29s)

[oh it's so so close i think i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m33s)

[end up having to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m36s)

[derive from that just to wrap it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m40s)

[because i want to set the http client](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m44s)

[and this doesn't give me direct access](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m47s)

[to do that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m49s)

[because it exposes the handlers for me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m54s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h04m56s)

[but doesn't quite give me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m02s)

[of this http pipeline grab the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m10s)

[that's thrown when it invokes the key](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m13s)

[vault and then suppress the exception](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m15s)

[and move on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m17s)

[that would be the ideal situation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m18s)

[and this guy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m21s)

[certainly allows for something like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m23s)

[um it just doesn't allow it from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m29s)

[the point where i have access to it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m33s)

[almost wish there was something a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m44s)

[cleaner here why are you not able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m46s)

[decompile into there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m48s)

[you opened it before](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m51s)

[okay oh is it because it's already open](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m53s)

[that visual studio you should know the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m56s)

[difference there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h05m58s)

[i'm just trying to make sure there's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m00s)

[some simple handler to get access to it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m02s)

[but this guy here clearly exposes the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m05s)

[the handlers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m10s)

[in the event that i want to get at it um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m11s)

[i can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h06m13s)

[hand out answers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m32s)

[um okay so it looks like this is gonna](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m35s)

[end up being an obnoxious rapper for it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m38s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m44s)

[teach them how to do it don't do it for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m45s)

[them yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m47s)

[completely agree](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m48s)

[there's actually a class right now that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m52s)

[um some colleagues are teaching at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m54s)

[the local university that's all on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m56s)

[basics of c sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h08m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m00s)

[it's uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m02s)

[there's i i've heard the phrase before](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m03s)

[those who can't teach um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m05s)

[and it's it's really a horrible thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m08s)

[because my opinion is that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m09s)

[by the time you're able to teach](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m12s)

[somebody um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m14s)

[by the time you're able to teach](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m16s)

[somebody else the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m17s)

[the answer uh or teach somebody else](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m19s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m23s)

[uh a topic you probably know it pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m25s)

[well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m28s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m30s)

[um i will say this i'm i'm already uh a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m33s)

[little twitchy since the first word in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m36s)

[the pdf is the word confidential](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h09m53s)

[okay so the assignment is and i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m04s)

[i'm a little hesitant to drag this thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m07s)

[on onto screen simply because it has the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m09s)

[word confidential at the top so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m11s)

[i will summarize briefly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m13s)

[the objectives are create an interface](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m17s)

[with appropriate configurations](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m19s)

[according to the requirements](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m20s)

[select appropriate data to capture](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m23s)

[information](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m26s)

[apply appropriate control structure and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m28s)

[control flow of execution to the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m30s)

[requirements](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m32s)

[manipulate data flow between the process](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m33s)

[of information according to the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m36s)

[requirements](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m37s)

[this is the objectives are unusually](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m40s)

[ambiguous](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m46s)

[got it though the screenshots in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m56s)

[seem to be rather helpful so this is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h10m58s)

[console level application and it looks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m01s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m03s)

[largely designed to teach some of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m04s)

[basics](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m06s)

[can't understand my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m10s)

[lecturer's explanation okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m12s)

[well that i that i am happy to to try](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m14s)

[and explain on so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m18s)

[just want to make sure i understand](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m20s)

[what's what's going on here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m25s)

[okay and i'm going to i i'm going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m26s)

[pull up a few other docs pages that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m28s)

[might be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m30s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m34s)

[there are so this is largely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m41s)

[let me see if i can get this going](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m47s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m52s)

[uh can't find the relevant links for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m55s)

[dummies that's what i'm trying to see if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m57s)

[i can find here real quick for you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h11m58s)

[because there are some good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m02s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m08s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m13s)

[i'm legit below average in the class so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m14s)

[so this is so okay so i'm gonna throw](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m20s)

[i'm gonna start throwing some links out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m23s)

[but i will warn you explanation coming](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m27s)

[so this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m29s)

[microsoft learn has been putting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m31s)

[together a lot of this and a good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m33s)

[portion of this assignment is just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m34s)

[around basics of c sharp i'm i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m36s)

[guessing that this is probably a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m39s)

[uh it's probably below a 300 level class](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m43s)

[i'm imagining i i don't know exactly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m48s)

[what what it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m52s)

[so far it's english](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m56s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m58s)

[so the the one thing i wanted to find on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h12m59s)

[here because there's there's a great one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m02s)

[and i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m05s)

[i'm looking for this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m07s)

[continue](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m11s)

[okay perfect](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m13s)

[these ones here are probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m14s)

[depending on how far into c sharp you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m16s)

[are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m19s)

[you may want to try these out so these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m19s)

[things here are using what is called](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m22s)

[net interactive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m25s)

[but the the code that you see over here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m27s)

[that you can then run](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m30s)

[um this editor here is no different than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m32s)

[what you could type in say vs code or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m35s)

[visual studio so it doesn't look like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m37s)

[they call out much](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m39s)

[i didn't see an editor listed here um it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m42s)

[just seemed to say to create the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m45s)

[c-sharp stuff so depending on what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m47s)

[you're uh using visual studio perfect um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m49s)

[highly recommend it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m54s)

[so anything that you can type into a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m55s)

[c-sharp file there can be done here and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h13m58s)

[this will start to give you a pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m01s)

[good handle of a lot of the basics of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m02s)

[the c-sharp syntax so especially as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m06s)

[you're learning usually that's the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m08s)

[hardest part for people starting out is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m10s)

[just grappling with what is the proper](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m12s)

[syntax like i need to come up with an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m15s)

[incantation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m18s)

[and figure out what that what that needs](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m19s)

[to be um yeah what is syntax perfect](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m22s)

[so this is probably a little below it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m26s)

[this next part here on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m29s)

[delete all the code the editor yes boss](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m36s)

[this is all around trying to teach the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m44s)

[what the syntax needs to look like um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m46s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m48s)

[if you are looking for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m50s)

[some information](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m53s)

[that would be a good one this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h14m59s)

[these two here are also both very good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m02s)

[so scott hanselman and kendra are very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m06s)

[well mika and bill are also very good so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m14s)

[i would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m17s)

[i would even propose potentially](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m18s)

[checking out those two but in terms of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m20s)

[the the actual assignment the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m23s)

[thing uh c sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m27s)

[interfaces so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m29s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m31s)

[this is probably going to be more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m38s)

[information than you need but these are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m40s)

[going to be at least from looking at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m42s)

[assignment the key language features](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m44s)

[that are being](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m47s)

[that are being asked for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m55s)

[see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m57s)

[probably better over here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h15m59s)

[reference types class so the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m04s)

[assignment calls out a static class](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m07s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m09s)

[the the documentation for it is here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m10s)

[again there's this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m14s)

[these last two links are all i'll say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m15s)

[language level docs these are not quite](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m18s)

[your beginner friendly stuff this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m20s)

[showing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m23s)

[you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m25s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m26s)

[i think the better option is almost](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m28s)

[assuredly this c-sharp for beginners](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m30s)

[or the the microsoft learn stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m32s)

[um oh where did it go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m36s)

[where did it go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m38s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m41s)

[um because these ones are going to be a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m43s)

[lot more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m45s)

[um interactive and walking you through](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m47s)

[the basics](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m50s)

[and trying to explain it step by step](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m51s)

[there's there's something very magical](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m53s)

[about having both that explanation and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m55s)

[the code sitting side by side i don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h16m57s)

[think they're gonna understand how to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m00s)

[create an interface based on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m01s)

[microsoft docs](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m02s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m04s)

[com completely agreed um these ones here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m04s)

[yeah so microsoft learn is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m08s)

[an absolutely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m11s)

[phenomenal place to go through and get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m12s)

[um this type of information](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m19s)

[that let me just i'm gonna scan through](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m20s)

[this thing real quick see if there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m22s)

[anything else but it looks like the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m23s)

[vast majority of this assignment is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m26s)

[create static class create an interface](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m33s)

[and then it's it's largely around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m36s)

[console input and console output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m39s)

[which are not terribly difficult um but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m46s)

[they are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m51s)

[they are worth noting um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h17m56s)

[uh that's not usually it's about world](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m02s)

[uh wrld](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m05s)

[i wish they wrote these assignments in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m08s)

[english](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m09s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m12s)

[the other one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m13s)

[yeah hello world and inner conduct](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m15s)

[c sharp interactive let me just check](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m18s)

[this one this one is probably not bad](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m20s)

[either](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m23s)

[yeah because that'll teach you the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m26s)

[basics of doing the console right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m27s)

[and formatting your output so that it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m29s)

[looks like the pictures](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m30s)

[um does it do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m33s)

[redline](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m34s)

[right right right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m38s)

[so this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m43s)

[this is not bad for figuring out um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m47s)

[i'll just do it with c sharp](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m53s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m56s)

[if you're already mostly familiar with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h18m58s)

[the basics this one might be a little](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m00s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m02s)

[easier um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m04s)

[list collections](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m09s)

[these ones um and actually i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m11s)

[drop this one too because this is good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m14s)

[uh i just don't understand the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m16s)

[default functions to input into the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m19s)

[the line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m21s)

[of coding](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m22s)

[sorry i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m27s)

[i'm not sure i understand that last](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m29s)

[i get what they're asking for okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m43s)

[got it okay](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m51s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m54s)

[in terms of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m55s)

[just walking through some of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h19m59s)

[the the first couple requirements are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m01s)

[all about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m03s)

[here's the c sharp class that you need](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m04s)

[to create and here and it needs to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m06s)

[contain uh a dictionary and i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m09s)

[some of these initial ones are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m12s)

[probably going to cover](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m14s)

[close to if not that exact use case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m18s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m21s)

[um the next requirements are are all](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m23s)

[around creating a menu](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m25s)

[so in terms of here i'm just gonna do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m28s)

[this real quick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m31s)

[it's about to sign off and then i got](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m32s)

[distracted see i always get distracted](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m33s)

[should really quit thinking that i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m36s)

[gonna sign off so create project](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m37s)

[come on any day now got too many](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m45s)

[templates loaded](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m47s)

[way too many console apps seven that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m49s)

[sounds like a great name great go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m51s)

[so a couple key key apis that you will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h20m56s)

[that you will want to know about so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m00s)

[this hello world the last one that i um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m02s)

[that i sent this will this will walk you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m07s)

[through a lot of the how do i create the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m10s)

[output like what those menus are showing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m12s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m15s)

[i don't know what fancy character](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m16s)

[they're using for like their pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m18s)

[headers i don't know how critical that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m20s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m22s)

[i would just use it could be an x for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m22s)

[all i care but the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m24s)

[the the important api to know about for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m26s)

[there is going to be this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m29s)

[console.writeline this is ultimately for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m30s)

[those for those first screenshots in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m32s)

[pdf where it's showing the output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m34s)

[you're going to end up writing uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m37s)

[console write lines](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m39s)

[this is this is what is going to end up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m41s)

[um actually taking and putting that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m44s)

[content out to screen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m49s)

[11 viewers streamer becomes popular](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m58s)

[uh my friends are here that sounds great](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h21m58s)

[uh so for example](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m04s)

[just picking on these select and option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m06s)

[right so so going through this first one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m10s)

[for the the c-sharp tutorial will at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m12s)

[least give you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m14s)

[something like this and i'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m16s)

[boom boom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m17s)

[copy paste a bunch of times](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m18s)

[option one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m22s)

[browser supports too good and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m30s)

[fix the numbering and then for example](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m33s)

[string](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m35s)

[input gets](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m36s)

[console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m38s)

[read line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m39s)

[i have no idea if this works in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m40s)

[browser so we're going to find out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m44s)

[also](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m48s)

[right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m49s)

[you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m51s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m53s)

[and so again this tutorial covers](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m55s)

[specifically this case here about this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h22m58s)

[dollar sign at the beginning the fancy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m00s)

[word for this is called string](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m02s)

[interpolation](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m03s)

[but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m05s)

[in short it lets you format](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m06s)

[output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m09s)

[uh oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m12s)

[three](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m14s)

[okay short version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m20s)

[don't use console redline in a browser](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m22s)

[that's a bad idea um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m24s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m27s)

[yeah and the urge to hit control s when](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m28s)

[writing is too strong](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m30s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m32s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m34s)

[you can tell when you've lost work when](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m36s)

[you get in that habit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m37s)

[um but this basic pattern nightmare is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m39s)

[what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m42s)

[most of this assignment is all based](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m43s)

[around some number of console write](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m45s)

[lines to generate some output](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m47s)

[a console read line call](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m50s)

[which allows the this will pause your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m52s)

[program and wait for the user to type in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m55s)

[some answer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h23m58s)

[and then it will take whatever the user](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m01s)

[typed in in this case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m04s)

[three](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m06s)

[and it will put it into the input](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m07s)

[variable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m09s)

[and then once it you have their input](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m11s)

[into a variable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m13s)

[you can then do whatever you would like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m14s)

[with it so one option is you can write](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m16s)

[it out to the screen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m18s)

[another option is you could do if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m20s)

[input is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m23s)

[the three thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m31s)

[yeah i agree um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m39s)

[the only reason i think it's redline and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m41s)

[not read key and this is very very very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m44s)

[subtle](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m47s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m48s)

[their](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m49s)

[their output after the input has a blank](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m50s)

[line which is why i think it's read line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m54s)

[not read key that's the only reason](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m56s)

[but you but you are correct round dev](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h24m59s)

[the the pdf is definitely not clear in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m01s)

[terms of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m04s)

[requirements but because they have a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m08s)

[blank line after their input i assume](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m10s)

[they did console refine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m12s)

[that's my working theory um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m20s)

[image under number four it is a number](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m24s)

[under the menu as well indicating input](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m26s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m29s)

[yeah that's what i was looking at and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m31s)

[that number one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m32s)

[has a blank line right after it which is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m34s)

[why i think they did a read line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m36s)

[because when the user presses enter that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m38s)

[submits it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m40s)

[but this is what you would end up doing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m41s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m43s)

[iterate through it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h25m59s)

[so the the entire point of this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h26m05s)

[literally to just iterate over a set of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h26m08s)

[i would it so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h26m54s)

[instructors that are very prescriptive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m20s)

[on assignments and say do x do i do z](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m22s)

[and um instructors that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m25s)

[leave a lot of ambiguity](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m28s)

[highly prescriptive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m35s)

[not a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h27m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m00s)

[yeah i agree and oftentimes i so i at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m04s)

[least in terms of me and my colleagues i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m08s)

[tend to be as far to the prescriptive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m10s)

[side as possible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m11s)

[i i usually go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m13s)

[intentional to try to make somebody](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m22s)

[learn something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m24s)

[but it's usually pretty prescriptive of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m25s)

[x y z and this thing starts off that way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m27s)

[a little bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m31s)

[of you must have a class it must be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m32s)

[static it must be named this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m37s)

[i i think the intent is to just say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m39s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m43s)

[that very first point is mostly about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m44s)

[this is the one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m47s)

[we want everybody to do it this one way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m48s)

[um which is fine](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m51s)

[i'm just trying to see](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h28m59s)

[from sorting files to image and text](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m05s)

[folders](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m07s)

[yeah i i'm really a little torn because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m33s)

[some of these points are pretty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m35s)

[ambiguous like the abnormal content](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m36s)

[display does not make sense to me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m39s)

[because there's been no information](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m41s)

[given as to what abnormal text is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m43s)

[and i i part of me wonders if you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m47s)

[intended to actually implement something](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m49s)

[like that or given that this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m51s)

[is so ambiguous i almost wonder if the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m54s)

[intent is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m57s)

[to hard code values](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h29m59s)

[that look like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m01s)

[but i don't know from just reading this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m07s)

[where do i input the directory name into](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m08s)

[the code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m10s)

[that is a good so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m12s)

[if it's ran if it's straight up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m16s)

[hard-coded values you would just type it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m18s)

[as a string if it's actually um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m20s)

[so there is some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m24s)

[see sure and i see that get cracking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m26s)

[question i'll come back to that real](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m28s)

[quick uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m29s)

[direct directory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m30s)

[get files](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m34s)

[i don't know that this is what they're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m37s)

[so assuming that you're supposed to use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m40s)

[real files and real folder pads](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m42s)

[this method here is probably what you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m46s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m48s)

[um and specifically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m49s)

[yeah so on these doc files just skim to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m52s)

[the bottom most of them have um sample](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m56s)

[code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h30m59s)

[and so specifically what you would end](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m01s)

[up doing is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m03s)

[the it's worth noting you will need a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m05s)

[using system.io at the top](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m07s)

[and then you'll be able to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m10s)

[directory.getfiles](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m12s)

[and point it at a string that is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m15s)

[folder path](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m17s)

[or a target directory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m19s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m22s)

[practically speaking and i have no idea](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m23s)

[what this is gonna let's not do it in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m25s)

[browser that just sounds like a horrible](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m27s)

[idea so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m33s)

[get files](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m35s)

[so if i had a sequel in temp directory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m39s)

[it would look something like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m41s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m44s)

[and so this would give me](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m45s)

[this would give me a ray bat an array](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m49s)

[of type string back listing all of the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m52s)

[files in my sql intent directory or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m55s)

[actually if i want to do something more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m57s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h31m59s)

[something like that would work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m02s)

[and so then this would be what you would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m07s)

[iterate over](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m09s)

[uh use relatives paths over hard code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m10s)

[yes i normally agree](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m14s)

[normally agree](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m17s)

[hard coded](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m19s)

[for clarity i'll say that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m20s)

[worth noting the at symbol at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m23s)

[beginning isn't strictly necessary it's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m24s)

[only there because without it the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m27s)

[backslash inside of a string is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m29s)

[escape character](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m31s)

[and so you end up needing to stop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m32s)

[helping you you end up needing to do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m34s)

[double backslash inside of quotes to get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m36s)

[a single slash](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m37s)

[and so often times when working with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m39s)

[files and file paths it's much easier to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m41s)

[just put an at the beginning which tells](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m43s)

[the c compiler](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m46s)

[don't do fancy stuff with my backslashes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m47s)

[literally treat a backslash character as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m50s)

[a backslash character](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m54s)

[okay i also have a question why would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m55s)

[someone use get crack](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h32m58s)

[i am glad you asked i am glad you asked](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m00s)

[um okay let me pull this over and pull](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m04s)

[something interesting up so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m07s)

[you can probably hunt my my previous](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m11s)

[streams in terms of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m16s)

[get kraken related content or get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m17s)

[related content specifically around](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m21s)

[yes that is a good point you can use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m24s)

[forward slashes um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m26s)

[they they look weird to windows devs](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m28s)

[but the ntfs file system since like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m31s)

[windows xp days or something um will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m34s)

[handle it for you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m37s)

[which is another option it'll also make](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m39s)

[you more friendly for cross plat](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m41s)

[the moment](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m49s)

[but in terms of get cracking my my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m50s)

[strong opinion is that developers should](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m53s)

[know how to use source control](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m56s)

[specifically git and be able to use it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h33m58s)

[well with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m00s)

[one of the get tools of choice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m01s)

[um i've got colleagues who are command](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m03s)

[line i've got some who prefer the actual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m06s)

[like built-in stuff in vs code um i've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m08s)

[got some that i've successfully](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m12s)

[converted to get kraken because i think](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m13s)

[it's awesome](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m15s)

[there are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m17s)

[lots of cool features in it the ones](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m18s)

[that usually sell me on it the most and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m20s)

[this is a bad example let's pick on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m22s)

[something that's not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m25s)

[this is a little more interesting a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m27s)

[little more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m30s)

[my](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m31s)

[my my personal reason is i like the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m33s)

[visualization of the the commit history](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m36s)

[tree](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m39s)

[um being able to quickly get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m40s)

[comparisons but there are a lot of tools](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m43s)

[out there and i believe github desktop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m45s)

[has a similar view like even like um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m46s)

[git extensions i think it was probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m51s)

[one of the earliest ones that had a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m53s)

[reasonable view of the commit graph](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m54s)

[but this one is interactable um being](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m57s)

[able to drag pointers around double](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h34m59s)

[click bounce](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m02s)

[it goes against the usual developer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m03s)

[mantra don't take your hand off the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m05s)

[keyboard put it on the mouse the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m06s)

[keyboard all the things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m08s)

[which is why so many people like command](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m10s)

[line the other thing that it has is they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m12s)

[introduced a terminal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m17s)

[uh before you panic um it is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m18s)

[powershell terminal it is very similar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m21s)

[to the powershell terminal inside of vs](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m23s)

[code they actually use the same uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m25s)

[underlying library that vs code uses for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m28s)

[um their built-in terminals so that they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m31s)

[didn't roll their own](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m33s)

[but the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m35s)

[the the cool parts with it are nice](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m37s)

[intellisense over the git commands](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m40s)

[especially the common ones](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m42s)

[which i find to be rather helpful as](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m45s)

[well as being able to visualize the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m48s)

[graph so if you prefer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m49s)

[if you prefer terminal based input this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m52s)

[is usually one of my favorite ways to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m54s)

[teach people git because i can teach](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h35m56s)

[the command line interaction but also](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m00s)

[have the visual representation of what's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m02s)

[going on right here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m04s)

[which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m06s)

[i think is awesome um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m07s)

[and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m10s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m10s)

[get bash um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m11s)

[get bash certainly works uh oh my posh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m14s)

[is another one that people love um a lot](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m20s)

[so those those type types of ones in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m23s)

[here so i think terminal is one reason](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m26s)

[why i would love get kraken the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m28s)

[interactive history graph is another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m31s)

[trying one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m35s)

[think what else](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m35s)

[and it's not to say that other get tools](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m37s)

[don't have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m39s)

[similar-ish features](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m42s)

[this one just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m45s)

[has been the one that i've loved the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m47s)

[most and this middle view is a lot is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m48s)

[is a big reason for it some of the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m51s)

[stuff on the side is nice there there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m53s)

[some other cool little things with the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m56s)

[um the repository management and they've](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h36m58s)

[got the workspaces where you can group](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m00s)

[stuff together and organize it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m02s)

[they built out a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m05s)

[public team stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m06s)

[um can i work with public and private](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m08s)

[repos of the free version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m14s)

[i think so but let me confirm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m18s)

[um also if you're interested in signing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m21s)

[up i wouldn't mind](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m23s)

[if you wanted to use the referral link](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m24s)

[so the big limitation that i or i should](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m26s)

[say one of the limitations i know with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m28s)

[the free version](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m30s)

[is you don't get access to azure devops](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m34s)

[so i don't know if that is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m38s)

[breaker for you or not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m44s)

[where is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m46s)

[i think you can get access to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m48s)

[like github private repos but i don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h37m56s)

[i'm looking private so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m02s)

[i wish they had a feature comparison](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m09s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m12s)

[free version oh public only](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m17s)

[probably not yeah probably not private](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m19s)

[repos](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m24s)

[the other the other unspoken dirty](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m26s)

[little secret with it is some of these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m29s)

[features they can only enforce](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m34s)

[on certain commands](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m36s)

[so for example pushing and pulling to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m37s)

[like private repos or azure devops](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m40s)

[you can still use get kraken to interact](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m43s)

[with your git repo locally you just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m45s)

[won't be able to execute the push or the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m47s)

[pull](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m49s)

[and consequently anything with the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m50s)

[remote so fetch push pull are the big](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m52s)

[ones that'll bite you um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m54s)

[and you can always drop into other get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m56s)

[tools um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h38m58s)

[to do that as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m00s)

[which often times i've done occasionally](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m02s)

[to just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m04s)

[like somebody's gotten their repo in a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m05s)

[bad state i'll pull get cracking get it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m07s)

[into a good state](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m09s)

[not bother with off because i don't want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m11s)

[to try to figure out how to authenticate](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m13s)

[against whatever](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m14s)

[git provider they're using and then just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m16s)

[tell them yeah okay now you push i don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m18s)

[want to think too hard](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m20s)

[so that is that is the other the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m23s)

[kind of kicker there as well](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m28s)

[um the other](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m36s)

[let me look um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m38s)

[you don't happen to be a student by any](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m41s)

[chance do you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m49s)

[i do not okay i was gonna say because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m51s)

[the the github student pack is uh i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m53s)

[believe comes with a year license to get](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m56s)

[kraken](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h39m59s)

[i might have to double check exactly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m01s)

[what's in it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m02s)

[see what's in the pack um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m04s)

[you know what actually i'm gonna just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m07s)

[drop this in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m08s)

[if anybody is a student this is highly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m11s)

[recommended the the amount of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m14s)

[free stuff that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m16s)

[yeah because you get access to the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m19s)

[whole get cracking suite](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m21s)

[so if you are a student the this is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m25s)

[basically a lot of the companies trying](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m27s)

[to get you suckered into liking their](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m29s)

[tools so that when you go out and get a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m31s)

[job](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m33s)

[your employer buys it for you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m34s)

[so that's the other thing with a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m37s)

[the tools like the place where i work](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m39s)

[we conveniently have a very nice policy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m42s)

[that says something along the lines of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m44s)

[developer time is expensive tools are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m46s)

[cheap therefore if a tool is going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m48s)

[improve a developer's productivity buy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m50s)

[them the tools](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m52s)

[it's a very simple policy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m54s)

[they don't like paying for tools that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m57s)

[people don't use but if there's a tool](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h40m59s)

[that will make somebody more productive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m00s)

[they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m03s)

[usually it's no more complicated than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m04s)

[asking for it which is wonderful](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m06s)

[um okay i feel like i missed a question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m08s)

[uh i did what you typed out for the menu](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m10s)

[but it doesn't work it works in the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m13s)

[dotnet editor](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m17s)

[the the question will be so there's a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m18s)

[there's a couple kind of kickers here so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m23s)

[i went and i so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m24s)

[do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m26s)

[i'm gonna do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m27s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m30s)

[the other thing that's not clear from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m33s)

[really is there a way to tell this thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m37s)

[to not do this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m47s)

[so this is one of the best and worst](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m49s)

[things about](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m51s)

[you know what we're gonna just get rid](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m53s)

[of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m55s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h41m56s)

[uh for the menu but it doesn't work but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m18s)

[it works in the net editor so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m19s)

[so something worth noting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m24s)

[depending on which version of visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m27s)

[the latest versions of net unfortunately](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m33s)

[they have](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m36s)

[it just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m41s)

[ah so you're on 2019. um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m44s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m47s)

[i'm going to do this from memory uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m48s)

[there is an option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m51s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m56s)

[so there's a if you go underneath tools](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h42m58s)

[options and then search i believe 2019](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m00s)

[has this same setting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m03s)

[where you're looking for automatically](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m05s)

[close the console when debugging stops i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m07s)

[believe in 2019 this defaulted to true](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m09s)

[and was set to false in 2022](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m17s)

[don't quote me i'm doing that entirely](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m19s)

[from memory](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m20s)

[this option will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m22s)

[if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m23s)

[if you turn this off it'll leave your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m24s)

[the output the other way that oftentimes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m30s)

[2019 has it defaulted to true](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m40s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m44s)

[so oftentimes this is what you see pop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m47s)

[and go away um but the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h43m49s)

[to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m04s)

[get the simplest thing working and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m05s)

[back away from it um by doing a console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m06s)

[application pause so it stops](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m16s)

[so then after the right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m20s)

[it'll sit here and wait for input and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m22s)

[then at the end it'll close so once you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m24s)

[press enter on that last read line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m26s)

[depending on the setting up inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m28s)

[the options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m31s)

[which is great i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m52s)

[window is closing too rapidly on you i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m57s)

[would propose turning that on and that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h44m59s)

[will probably](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m01s)

[go a long way or just slap a console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m02s)

[another look at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m15s)

[show me some really slick features that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m20s)

[it has](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m22s)

[i've got some people who](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m23s)

[that i work with that absolutely love it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m25s)

[long time](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m30s)

[um vs 2022 i decided to not install it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m31s)

[and see how long i could go without it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m34s)

[and outside of its](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m37s)

[really nice support for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m39s)

[like inline templates i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m41s)

[remember the resharper terminology for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m42s)

[it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m45s)

[because it had a really nice way of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m46s)

[doing inline templates that you could](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m48s)

[gen stuff up really quickly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m49s)

[aside from that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m52s)

[the built-in stuff in visual studio is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m53s)

[pretty darn good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m56s)

[it's pretty good](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m57s)

[to the point where i haven't felt the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h45m59s)

[urge to go back to resharper i do miss](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m00s)

[the template those](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m04s)

[some of the keybinds i can't live](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m06s)

[without](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m07s)

[duplicate line etc](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m09s)

[um yeah there's a few of them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m12s)

[so there there are some that now exist](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m18s)

[in visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m19s)

[and i think by default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m21s)

[some of these are actually on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m23s)

[um you are correct the that there are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m25s)

[some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m28s)

[there are some key binds that only will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m30s)

[work in resharper that aren't in visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m33s)

[studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m35s)

[but at least duplicate line control d](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m36s)

[will do it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m38s)

[and if you're willing to and if you're](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m40s)

[willing to spend the effort to go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m41s)

[through the um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m43s)

[the effort of doing your key bindings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m46s)

[you can get a few more turned on too i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m48s)

[for a while i did go through and reset](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m50s)

[my key bindings](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m52s)

[um to get as many of the resharper ones](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m54s)

[it just became not worth it i also used](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m56s)

[to use the intellij key bindings inside](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h46m59s)

[of c sharp and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m01s)

[i finally had to untrain my fingers from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m03s)

[that it bothered a lot of people who](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m05s)

[tried to use it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m07s)

[for unity mod development and it sucks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m14s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m18s)

[i'm assuming it must be a slightly older](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m19s)

[version of unity or similar because i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m21s)

[thought they supported 2022.](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m23s)

[a lot of their developers are usually uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m26s)

[johnny on the spot for going to doing it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m28s)

[um how do you get the text to show up in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m31s)

[the console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m33s)

[so i guess it depends on so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m35s)

[if you are referring to the hello world](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m40s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m42s)

[right here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m44s)

[that just comes from the console right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m45s)

[line call](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m47s)

[if you are referring to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m48s)

[because all this is doing is writing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m53s)

[console the other part down here this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m55s)

[this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h47m59s)

[is all coming from visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m00s)

[and i don't recall if this is in visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m03s)

[studio 2019 or not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m05s)

[it might not be this might be a visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m07s)

[yeah i i don't recall how much of that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m11s)

[is in there so they did a lot of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m14s)

[improvements with visual studio 2022 and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m17s)

[i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m19s)

[think some of it was this i don't recall](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m21s)

[exactly though](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m23s)

[normally you would normally this is the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m25s)

[old school way that people would do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m27s)

[simple console apps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m32s)

[version of unity due to beat saber](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m37s)

[sticking with an older version of unity](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m39s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m40s)

[gotcha](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m41s)

[that makes sense](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m47s)

[would you recommend me switch to 2022 to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m51s)

[do this project](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m54s)

[um so the the answer to your question on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m56s)

[how is tools options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h48m58s)

[and then on the left side it should be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m01s)

[under debugging general there's a long](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m03s)

[list in here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m07s)

[and last time i just searched for it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m09s)

[for me it's near the bottom i don't](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m12s)

[remember where it is in visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m14s)

[02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:21,439](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m15s)

but you are looking for the

[automatically closed console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m18s)

[but again tools options from the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m24s)

[the menu and this should be unchecked](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m27s)

[and that should keep](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m30s)

[yeah that'll only keep the console](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m32s)

[window open it won't give you that extra](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m34s)

[output like what i had at the bottom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m36s)

[i don't i don't think there's a way for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m40s)

[you to get that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m41s)

[in an older visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m43s)

[but doing a console read line like this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m45s)

[and just having to pause at the end](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m48s)

[should at least get you that much](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m51s)

[i don't expect you to see all of this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m55s)

[extra output there's actually nothing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m56s)

[valuable in here aside from telling you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h49m58s)

[where that option is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m03s)

[in terms of the question of should you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m04s)

[switch to 2022 um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m06s)

[i'd probably say yes](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m13s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m16s)

[what i would probably actually recommend](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m17s)

[is if the instructor is teaching](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m19s)

[um with visual studio 2019 i would stick](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m22s)

[with that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m25s)

[it'll probably be easier on you to match](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m26s)

[whatever the instructor is teaching with](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m30s)

[um visual studio 22 22 2022 has lots of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m33s)

[new features there's some things that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m37s)

[have moved around it's gonna push you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m39s)

[onto the latest c-sharp it's got some](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m41s)

[really cool intellisense and ai built](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m44s)

[into it to try to make writing code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m46s)

[easier but if it's vastly different than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m48s)

[what your instructor is using it'll](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m51s)

[probably only make it harder to learn](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m57s)

[i i would say](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h50m58s)

[if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m01s)

[you're it may be worth trying but i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m02s)

[would also propose working in whatever](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m05s)

[the instructor is using because that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m07s)

[will probably make your life](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m09s)

[um a lot less of a headache](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m11s)

[let's see 20 22 is 64 bit so use more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m17s)

[memory and feel less laggy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m20s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m22s)

[so in addition to them finally getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m24s)

[64-bit support](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m26s)

[which only took them like many years](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m28s)

[beyond when it probably should have been](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m31s)

[done](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m32s)

[um because it was a big undertaking](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m33s)

[the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m36s)

[it's also real it's a lot more](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m37s)

[performant um you'll note](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m39s)

[like just even the speed at which visual](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m41s)

[studio starts up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m43s)

[is significantly faster in 2022](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m45s)

[so it is it is very](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m48s)

[there's a lot of niceness to it so if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m50s)

[you were just starting out and learning](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m55s)

[how does one make the symbols that cover](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m57s)

[the heading that is a good question and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h51m59s)

[i couldn't tell from the pdf what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m02s)

[symbols those were](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m03s)

[so the short version is you just type](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m05s)

[them](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m10s)

[oh they're just percents oh then i would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m16s)

[just do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m18s)

[and then maybe](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m21s)

[i don't know](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m24s)

[a couple percents there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m25s)

[hey equality thanks for the follow i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m27s)

[appreciate it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m28s)

[and something like that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m30s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m32s)

[that's prettier](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m36s)

[so it's legitimately just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m38s)

[yeah just more right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m42s)

[so so legitimately you should be able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m45s)

[look at the the lines in the pdf and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m48s)

[and each line of output that you see in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m52s)

[the picture](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m55s)

[should convert into a console.writeline](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m56s)

[in your code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h52m58s)

[and it should be much more complicated](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m00s)

[than that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m02s)

[it i should say it doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m03s)

[more complicated than that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m05s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m07s)

[like i said feel free to uh to drop](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m09s)

[stuff on the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m11s)

[the discord if you'd like um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m13s)

[there's there's plenty of people in](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m17s)

[there that that keep track of it and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m19s)

[watch it but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m22s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m24s)

[for what it's worth](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m25s)

[robert you subscribed again thank you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m37s)

[you only need one right line for the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m39s)

[header](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m41s)

[yeah so it's so here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m49s)

[oct](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m56s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h53m59s)

[it's it's also worth noting that there](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m00s)

[is like console right versus right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m02s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m06s)

[so yeah so it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m08s)

[like](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m10s)

[if hypothetically you wanted to write](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m11s)

[part of this and then part of it so here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m16s)

[keep threatening to go to bed and i'm](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m19s)

[gonna](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m21s)

[tomorrow's gonna not feel good so for](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m22s)

[example](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m25s)

[up](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m30s)

[and then i can do this hey nobody](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m32s)

[pointed out that i didn't spell hello](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m34s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m38s)

[we could do something like this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m45s)

[this is just proof of concept so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m47s)

[you'll note rather than doing right line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m50s)

[i do rights](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m52s)

[which legitimately all they do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m54s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m58s)

[not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h54m59s)

[drop down to the next line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m00s)

[i tried to point out uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m03s)

[thank you robert](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m08s)

[it's probably people are just getting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m11s)

[used to the fact that i can't spell to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m12s)

[save my life](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m14s)

[and so just accept that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m15s)

[i'm gonna be bad at it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m17s)

[so there there is a right method and the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m20s)

[only difference between right and right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m22s)

[line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m24s)

[is whether it's gonna drop onto the next](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m25s)

[line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m27s)

[percent done of the project](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m28s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m30s)

[as as one of the students mentioned](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m32s)

[earlier](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m34s)

[baby steps and as we all started](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m35s)

[somewhere we all started learning at](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m38s)

[different points](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m40s)

[uh the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m43s)

[yeah i accepted it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m45s)

[thanks](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m51s)

[so that's gonna be the that's gonna be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m53s)

[going through the console read again so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h55m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m03s)

[pick option right and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m05s)

[show](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m10s)

[options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m11s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m13s)

[this would be something like if input](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m14s)

[equals equals one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m16s)

[public static void do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m22s)

[option one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m25s)

[function](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m34s)

[this is another reason that you may not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m37s)

[want to jump on the latest visual studio](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m38s)

[you'll note i'm getting extra options so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m40s)

[for example if i do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m42s)

[i'm going to do some breakpoints uh this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m45s)

[is something else and i'm i've been](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m46s)

[contemplating doing a stream on this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m48s)

[visual studio debugging stuff](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m50s)

[if you're unfamiliar with uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m52s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m54s)

[break points](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m56s)

[this little vertical bar left of your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h56m57s)

[line numbers lets you set them the f9](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m00s)

[key will also turn them on or off](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m02s)

[but they let you they let you walk](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m05s)

[through your code a step at a time so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m07s)

[for example if i press one and then hit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m09s)

[enter](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m10s)

[these little and vs 2019 they have the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m12s)

[same shapes but they are slightly](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m15s)

[different colors](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m16s)

[this will let you start to look at the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m20s)

[state of your program so if you hover on](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m23s)

[your variables you'll start to see oh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m25s)

[input has the value of one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m27s)

[and then i can use this thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m29s)

[step over](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m32s)

[and actually we probably should just use](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m34s)

[step into on all of these which means go](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m36s)

[into the thing so i see okay input](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m38s)

[equals one so i went inside my if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m40s)

[statement i can step into again and now](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m41s)

[i'm inside of my function](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m44s)

[now i'm at the end of my function](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m46s)

[click it again now i'm back where i came](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m49s)

[from](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m51s)

[and now i am at the end of the if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m52s)

[and now i'm at the console read line](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m55s)

[and now i am frozen because i'm waiting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m58s)

[for the console read line to be resolved](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h57m59s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m01s)

[especially when learning i often times](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m02s)

[try to teach people how to use the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m04s)

[debugger because it will save you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m06s)

[most of what i do most of what people do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m10s)

[when they program throughout the day is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m11s)

[debug we i think i probably spend three](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m13s)

[to four times more time debugging than i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m16s)

[do writing code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m19s)

[it is a very worthwhile skill to learn](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m21s)

[just from the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m26s)

[standpoint of being able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m27s)

[reason about your code it's nice to be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m29s)

[able to read code and reason about what](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m30s)

[it's doing um but some there's there's](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m32s)

[very few substitutes for having a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m35s)

[debugger being able to look at current](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m37s)

[state](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m39s)

[so if you are unfamiliar with it i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m40s)

[definitely recommend](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m43s)

[trying this out and be become familiar](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m44s)

[with the step into step over and step](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m46s)

[out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m49s)

[buttons at the top there's also function](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m50s)

[keys for them um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m52s)

[let's see if 10 is step over f11 to step](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m54s)

[into and step out is something else i](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m58s)

[can't remember shift f11](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h58m59s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m03s)

[uh so i need to do five ifs is that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m04s)

[correct that would be that would be one](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m06s)

[approach to doing it it so you could do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m13s)

[input equals two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m14s)

[do the thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m16s)

[better than doing five ifs because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m17s)

[you'll remember once i left here it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m19s)

[started falling down the rest of code](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m21s)

[would be an elsif](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m23s)

[because then after it if this thing ends](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m26s)

[up being true it won't bother to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m28s)

[evaluate the rest of them these things](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m30s)

[start to be mutually exclusive](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m34s)

[the other option and this is what uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m35s)

[ron dev was saying earlier is another](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m38s)

[option that is worth considering](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m41s)

[especially if you're learning out](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m42s)

[so one if for l-sip yes that would be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m45s)

[one option](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m47s)

[the other way of doing it is you could](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m48s)

[use what's called a switch statement not](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m51s)

[to be confused with a switch expression](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m53s)

[but in each of these these are the rough](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m56s)

[equivalent of doing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=02h59m58s)

[multiple if statements](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m06s)

[what you would do is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m07s)

[do function one and then](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m10s)

[consequently down here so when you end](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m13s)

[up in a situation would be where you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m15s)

[have a bunch of if statements that are](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m18s)

[all mutually exclusive options](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m19s)

[like if input is one it can't also be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m22s)

[two it can't be three etcetera so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m24s)

[you can only have one of these matches](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m27s)

[in those situations you typically want](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m29s)

[to switch into a switch statement](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m34s)

[it's more performant than a bunch of if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m34s)

[conditions](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m36s)

[usually there's there's a lot of weird](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m39s)

[caveats with switch but](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m41s)

[in general it's the better option to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m43s)

[pick it also tends to be a little bit](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m45s)

[cleaner](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m47s)

[depending on what you do](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m48s)

[switch is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m50s)

[usually more efficient um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m53s)

[there's a subjective question that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m57s)

[always gets raised about which one is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h00m59s)

[easier to read](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m03s)

[and i guess i would raise the question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m05s)

[to you is this one easier for you to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m07s)

[read and understand what's happening or](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m10s)

[is this easier to read and understand](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m12s)

[what's happening](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m13s)

[because in some cases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m16s)

[these two will compile down to the exact](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m18s)

[same thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m20s)

[and in some cases the switch statement](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m22s)

[will be faster](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m24s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m31s)

[i love that quote](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m34s)

[write your code like the next maintainer](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m37s)

[is a serial axe murderer that has your](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m38s)

[address so it's a matter of preference](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m43s)

[yeah so it is so yes it is it is a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m48s)

[matter of preference functionally these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m51s)

[are both going to do the same thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m52s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m56s)

[inside of each of these things uh they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m57s)

[are they're gonna get you the same](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h01m59s)

[result and it often comes down to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m01s)

[what is the most readable and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m04s)

[maintainable](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m06s)

[that's that's what's really important](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m07s)

[and it is subjective in a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m10s)

[and there's there's always the question](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m12s)

[of well if i use all these cool new](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m13s)

[language features things it's really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m15s)

[cool but people might not be able to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m18s)

[read it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m19s)

[and there's not a there's not a 100](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m21s)

[answer there so especially while people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m22s)

[are learning i would say write it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m24s)

[whichever way](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m26s)

[you can](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m28s)

[uh read and make sense of the easiest](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m29s)

[um worth noting](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m33s)

[there is also a default case here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m35s)

[which would be the equivalent of if you](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m39s)

[had an else block down here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m40s)

[that just matches everything else](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m43s)

[so this match is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m46s)

[not one and not two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m48s)

[same with this one here](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m54s)

[worth worth knowing about these two](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m55s)

[different approaches again](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h02m57s)

[there's there's potentially performance](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m01s)

[implications nobody likes looking at a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m02s)

[long string of ifs especially if these](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m04s)

[conditions start to get really](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m07s)

[convoluted um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m15s)

[uh weight or semicolon](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m18s)

[what i usually do with the default](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m25s)

[is a go-to but that's just personal](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m28s)

[preference](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m29s)

[uh colon after case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m31s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m36s)

[yeah and that so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m44s)

[yeah so the comment in there about a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m48s)

[switch statement either compiling down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m49s)

[to a set of ifs or a set uh or or a jump](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m51s)

[table](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m54s)

[there are a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m55s)

[where was it there there it is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h03m59s)

[there it's not always obvious what a](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m01s)

[what a switch statement is going to](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m04s)

[compile down into](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m08s)

[and it can be](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m10s)

[quite complicated so](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m11s)

[uh oh it's fixed now it had some red](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m14s)

[squiggly lines yeah](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m18s)

[so yes in general a switch statement](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m20s)

[will probably be faster in most cases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m22s)

[there's there's other new language](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m25s)

[features called switch expressions which](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m27s)

[get to be even more fun in how they](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m28s)

[potentially compile down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m30s)

[a lot of times programmers will often](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m32s)

[favor the switch statement because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m34s)

[they are used to the um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m37s)

[this thing being a jump table and](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m39s)

[jumping to an individual case because](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m41s)

[for example if you have five](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m43s)

[five l-sips to get down to option five](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m45s)

[it has to evaluate this one then this](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m48s)

[one then this one then this one all the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m50s)

[way down](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m51s)

[whereas the switch statement will](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m53s)

[oftentimes just jump straight to the the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m54s)

[right case](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h04m56s)

[and so often times this is why people](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m03s)

[will will prefer this because of that um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m05s)

[it's referred to as a jump table in many](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m10s)

[cases where it'll just simply go right](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m11s)

[to the case that you want rather than](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m14s)

[evaluating if this else if this else if](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m15s)

[this all the way down in order](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m19s)

[evaluating five things only to realize](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m21s)

[oh i'm the fifth thing versus just](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m23s)

[jumping to the fifth thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m25s)

[i also do appreciate the comment that](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m40s)

[unless your job is fine tuning systems](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m42s)

[do not worry about performance amen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m44s)

[the the general the general uh policy](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m48s)

[that you should follow is uh make it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m51s)

[work make it right make it fast](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m53s)

[so in that order and problems happen](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m56s)

[when you try to skip steps](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h05m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m02s)

[yeah you could so i had this thing](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m06s)

[invoke a separate function but it would](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m08s)

[be very possible to just invoke the](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m10s)

[the code for each function inside of](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m13s)

[these cases](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m15s)

[that would that would certainly be an](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m18s)

[option and given how ambiguous the pdf](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m20s)

[is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m22s)

[i think within the realm of reason](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m23s)

[once i missed a line in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m27s)

[it just seems to say what to output it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m33s)

[doesn't necessarily say how to output it](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m35s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/4Wjx2uJvXcU?t=03h06m39s)
