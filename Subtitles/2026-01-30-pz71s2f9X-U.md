[Hey everyone, welcome back. Sorry for my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m01s)

[significantly delayed start. I had](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m04s)

[technical difficulties earlier and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m06s)

[apparently when I thought I had finally](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m08s)

[gotten my stream up and running, uh, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m11s)

[hadn't. And so I've been talking to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m13s)

[myself for the last little bit, which](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m15s)

[has been very, very exciting. Um, not a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m16s)

[ton of announcements today, but one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m21s)

[thing to to mention is last time I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m22s)

[teased out that I was doing an interview](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m25s)

[with Mads Stoson, the lead designer on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m27s)

[the C# team. That video is coming out](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m29s)

[publicly uh this weekend, but if you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m32s)

[want to take a and check it out a little](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m35s)

[bit early. If you join the wrong hand](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m37s)

[there, if you join the Discord um under](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m41s)

[the streaming channel, you will find a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m44s)

[link to it. So it is there if you want](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m45s)

[to check it out or if you are watching](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m47s)

[this and it is uh past February 1st 2026](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m48s)

[uh it's live on my YouTube which the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m53s)

[link will come up there or you can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m56s)

[probably divine the right link to go and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m58s)

[find it or if you're watching on YouTube](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h00m59s)

[go check it out. So that should be up in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m01s)

[there. Uh tonight my plan is to finish](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m04s)

[off the ZAML test stuff that we had been](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m06s)

[working on last time. uh we had kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m08s)

[ended with fighting with some of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m11s)

[source generators because we updated to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m12s)

[net 10 and net 10 uh brought in some](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m14s)

[extra warnings and similar for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m18s)

[incremental generators for people hadn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m20s)

[converted. I hadn't converted yet. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m22s)

[have warnings as airs on. It's now time](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m24s)

[to deal with the problem. So working](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m26s)

[through those things and I had done a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m29s)

[little work during the week just getting](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m31s)

[the uh unit test generator up and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m33s)

[running. So there's multiple source](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m36s)

[generators in ZAML test. one of them. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m37s)

[generate unit tests for all of the WPF](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m40s)

[control types just to make sure I've](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m43s)

[covered everything. And that is where](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m45s)

[our story begins of where this is going](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m47s)

[to be. So, uh let me switch over here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m51s)

[Okay. So, this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m56s)

[where we are at. And if I look at my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h01m59s)

[test explorer itself,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m03s)

[uh, this guy here, um, there are a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m05s)

[sizable number of tests. And I realized](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m09s)

[something that I had messed up on is the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m11s)

[the previous version. So I've got two](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m15s)

[checkouts. I got one that's sitting back](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m19s)

[on my master branch. And if I look at](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m20s)

[the test explorer here, I will note that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m22s)

[my generated test, there's only 555 of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m24s)

[them. But if I check out the generated](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m26s)

[test here, there's 619 of them. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m29s)

[after a little bit of digging, what I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m33s)

[discovered was that a lot of these tests](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m35s)

[were because I was actually now properly](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m38s)

[testing everything, whereas before I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m40s)

[wasn't. So, for example, this one has](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m42s)

[framework element uh generated extension](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m45s)

[tests. Great. Um the problem is this one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m49s)

[doesn't. It's just not there. And so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m53s)

[those tests are now failing a and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h02m58s)

[properly failing because I generated](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m01s)

[extension methods that I never had tests](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m04s)

[over. So I didn't realize those](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m06s)

[extension methods weren't working. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m07s)

[there's a handful of them in here to go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m10s)

[through and address. And one of them is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m12s)

[the get parent call. So get parent](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m14s)

[typically will return back a dependency](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m16s)

[object.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m20s)

[Um and so an I visual element of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m21s)

[dependency object which is what this get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m24s)

[parent is going to return and right now](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m27s)

[we are failing because it's not doing a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m30s)

[conversion properly. So that is that is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m32s)

[the current one to fix because there are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m35s)

[a handful of test failures but I think a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m37s)

[lot of these are coming from](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m39s)

[me just not having tested these methods](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m42s)

[before and those not working. So I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m44s)

[slightly motivated to get these things](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m48s)

[to work. I could always add them to an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m49s)

[exclusion list, but this one is one that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m51s)

[should really work because with ZAML](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m53s)

[test, when you get back something that's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m55s)

[a dependency object, what it's actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h03m58s)

[expected to do instead is return back](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m00s)

[one of these I visual elements. So the I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m02s)

[visual element isn't the actual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m04s)

[dependency object itself because it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m06s)

[not serializable. But what it is is it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m08s)

[is effectively a reference or a pointer](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m11s)

[to that real element. So when you act on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m13s)

[the visual element itself, it just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m15s)

[marshals all of its calls back across to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m18s)

[the uh hosted WPF app where the element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m20s)

[actually lives and then acts on that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m23s)

[directly, which is great. The problem](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m25s)

[that we run into here is get parent](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m28s)

[itself. Dang it, stop it. get parent uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m30s)

[calls into uh get property and it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m35s)

[passing a generic parameter of v i](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m38s)

[visual element of dependency object](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m42s)

[which is good um but it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m45s)

[quite what we are going for um because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m49s)

[when we get down to this get as down](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m52s)

[here which is what I was diving into](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m54s)

[which is actually over here we run into](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m57s)

[this problem where it's wanting to do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h04m59s)

[this type check and it. Oh, well, if](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m01s)

[element is the typed element that we're](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m04s)

[after, let's just go ahead and return](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m06s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m07s)

[Which is fine except for element will](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m09s)

[not be of the type that we've asked for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m12s)

[because in this case element is going to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m14s)

[be um an I visual element of list box](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m17s)

[and we've asked for an I visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m21s)

[of dependency object which doesn't quite](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m23s)

[work. So that's kind of frustrating](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m26s)

[and I don't like it. Um, I actually I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m31s)

[was realizing something I should test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m34s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m35s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m37s)

[because the um this guy here, I kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m39s)

[just want to make Stop it. Stop moving](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m42s)

[around. Um, I kind of want to just do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m44s)

[this call back over in my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m47s)

[test uh class so that this guy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m51s)

[can be uh validated. And I can change](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m56s)

[this. I can change this generic type. It](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h05m59s)

[will um let's see bar fu gets because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m02s)

[my theory is if I change this to list](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m06s)

[box it works.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m08s)

[That is my that is my working theory.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m12s)

[So, I want to I want to validate that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m15s)

[real quick and make sure that I do in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m17s)

[fact get all the way down](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m19s)

[because I suspect my my conversion logic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m25s)

[needs to be expanded because visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m28s)

[element does have an as method that lets](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m31s)

[you convert it to different visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m33s)

[element types, which is great,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m36s)

[very good, but it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m39s)

[perfect. So, we're we're working on it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m41s)

[Yeah. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m45s)

[Oh, okay. That doesn't count because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m48s)

[used var and didn't realize that I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m51s)

[missed my await. Try it again.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m52s)

[Like that. That doesn't look like what I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m56s)

[expect.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m58s)

[Yeah. So, my apologies for the late](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h06m59s)

[start. I between my technical](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m01s)

[difficulties and then my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m03s)

[stupidity of not clicking the right](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m06s)

[button.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m08s)

[Okay. Okay, so fu comes through we get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m11s)

[this here and so the issue is that get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m13s)

[parent when you pass in I visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m17s)

[of list box it works but when you pass](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m20s)

[in uh I visual element of dependency](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m23s)

[object it doesn't actually let me just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m26s)

[confirm that again](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m29s)

[uh because that is exactly what this guy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m32s)

[does](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m35s)

[right yes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m36s)

[so I want to just because now This guy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m39s)

[should fail with the same cannot convert](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m42s)

[string to blah blah blah blah blah. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m44s)

[the only reason it's trying to convert](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m46s)

[to string is because it's falling back](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m48s)

[to its serialization logic because it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m50s)

[doesn't realize that the if condition at](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m52s)

[the beginning of this was supposed to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m54s)

[have passed.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h07m56s)

[It is interesting to me that my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m03s)

[my visual element here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m08s)

[because it is an eye visual element. Oh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m20s)

[it's just so close. It's so close.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m22s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m27s)

[yeah, I feel like I need a much more](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m35s)

[expanded logic here. And I I think what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m37s)

[I want is expanded logic very similar to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m40s)

[the as logic that I have inside of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m43s)

[visual element itself.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m46s)

[Um, and I'd like to because this guy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m50s)

[here has a convert method, which is what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m53s)

[this this one here calls,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h08m57s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m02s)

[because that's that's ultimately kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m06s)

[what I am after.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m08s)

[Just flatten this up. I just want to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m10s)

[make sure I've got this because visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m11s)

[element of T influential visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m13s)

[and visual element of T. I think this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m16s)

[the guy that has the as on it. Yeah. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m18s)

[the non-generic has the as. The problem](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m21s)

[is the as here wants to be of t element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m23s)

[and I need something not quite that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m29s)

[Not quite that. I I but I because I've](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m33s)

[got that logic already over here. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m37s)

[think I want to leverage](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m39s)

[this same thing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m42s)

[because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m46s)

[when does](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m50s)

[when does element get set?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m53s)

[Let me look over here on the server side](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h09m56s)

[of the fence because I think um if we go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m00s)

[here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m05s)

[because there's a set value method](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m06s)

[property result](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m10s)

[so it only sets the element property](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m12s)

[when the value is a dependency object.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m17s)

[So I am very much inclined](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m22s)

[I'm very inclined to do something clever](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m27s)

[here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m30s)

[where](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m33s)

[if the t so just going to we're we're](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m38s)

[just going to pseudo code this for a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m41s)

[second. So if uh element is not null and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m42s)

[t is i visual element, right? Like I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m48s)

[want something of that nature. Like I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m52s)

[can't do this because this is not how](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m55s)

[you do a a type check.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h10m57s)

[But this is kind of this is kind of what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m02s)

[I want to end up doing. If if that is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m04s)

[the case, what I would like to do is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m06s)

[element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m08s)

[as](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m12s)

[T vvisual element, right? Like I want](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m14s)

[where T visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m19s)

[like I I want to be able to leverage](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m22s)

[that same as logic, but I'm going to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m24s)

[need to pull that sucker out.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m25s)

[So it's so okay. So let's if that's the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m33s)

[logic I want. So this is going to end up](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m36s)

[needing to be let's see type of t](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m38s)

[um is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m43s)

[assignable to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m45s)

[no is assignable to uh type of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m47s)

[visual element. So if we can assign the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m53s)

[type of t to a visual element and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m55s)

[element is not null we know we got a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h11m59s)

[dependency. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m02s)

[uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m04s)

[do we know we got a dependency object?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m06s)

[I don't do I want this down here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m11s)

[I mean, it's probably worth keeping that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m16s)

[as a quick exit for the cases where it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m18s)

[done, but then I think we need this fall](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m21s)

[back](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m23s)

[because if we ask for it of the right](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m25s)

[type, great. Fine. It just works.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m27s)

[But if it's not of the type we expect,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m32s)

[we need to effectively downcast it. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m36s)

[if that's the case there,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m41s)

[I almost want an as that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m46s)

[So we know that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m55s)

[T won't be the non-generic vis visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h12m59s)

[element. And actually I think what we](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m03s)

[actually want is visual element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m06s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m09s)

[oh, so I actually need to do something](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m13s)

[more clever here because I need type of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m14s)

[t](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m16s)

[uh is var](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m19s)

[generic type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m23s)

[and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m27s)

[okay we we need to do we need to make](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m29s)

[this a lot more robust. Generic type dot](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m31s)

[is generic type definition](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m35s)

[right](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m40s)

[represents from which other generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m44s)

[types can be constructed. No, I always](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m46s)

[get these confused. In this case,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m49s)

[generic type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m52s)

[uh and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m54s)

[uh generic type generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h13m58s)

[uh what is it?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m02s)

[No, it is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m14s)

[Where's the generic? Okay. Why Why am I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m19s)

[Why am I botching this? Because I want](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m23s)

[to get the open generic and then pull](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m25s)

[the parameter out.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m29s)

[Yeah. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m32s)

[Custom modifiers blah blah blah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m35s)

[So generic type generic parameter](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m40s)

[just do this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m50s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m53s)

[I want to just grab it here. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m56s)

[we're going to go here and we're going](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m58s)

[to just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h14m59s)

[we're going to send it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m02s)

[Get rid of that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m05s)

[We can actually probably get rid of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m08s)

[that, too.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m09s)

[There we go. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m13s)

[F11.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m18s)

[So generic type,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m20s)

[right? Generic type is generic type is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m24s)

[true.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m27s)

[And then what I want is the generic type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m28s)

[arguments.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m31s)

[Oh boy. uh code with uh Taffida Zawa.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m35s)

[Hopefully I'm not butchering that too](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m40s)

[much. Welcome to the stream.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m42s)

[Welcome to the stream. We are struggling](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m44s)

[a little bit with my ZAML test library](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m47s)

[trying to figure out how I can make my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m49s)

[conversion logic not suck. Past me made](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m52s)

[some horrendous mistakes and so current](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m55s)

[me is trying to correct them.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h15m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m00s)

[so there's the generic type and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m03s)

[really I think what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m09s)

[because I I I want to check if the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m13s)

[generic type definition of this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m20s)

[because the element knows it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m26s)

[its type here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m31s)

[And so because this element knows its](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m33s)

[type, what I kind of want to do is just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m35s)

[pull this type off.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m37s)

[Actually, I don't know if I have access](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m41s)

[to that directly.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m42s)

[I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m46s)

[I don't have access to that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m48s)

[But I guess as if I can pull the generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m51s)

[So I just want to pull the generic ARG](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m54s)

[off of here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m56s)

[um because I just want to pull the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h16m59s)

[generic ar off of T. So I really want to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m00s)

[just say if this generic type is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m03s)

[uh so where do I find my generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m15s)

[why am I blanking on how to do this? And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m16s)

[generic type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m19s)

[uh get generic type definition. That's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m23s)

[why it's a method, not that's why I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m25s)

[being I'm being an idiot. And get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m26s)

[generic type definition](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m28s)

[uh type of I visual element of open](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m32s)

[generic.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m36s)

[So if we get through all of there then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m39s)

[var element type uh is going to be uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m43s)

[generic type generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m48s)

[generic type arguments subzero. or we](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m51s)

[can make a sweeping assumption that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m54s)

[there's exactly one because we compared](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m55s)

[it against an open generic aarity one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h17m57s)

[We have this and then what I kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m01s)

[want to do then is just return element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m04s)

[as](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m07s)

[element type. I think that's what I want](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m09s)

[right there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m11s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m14s)

[as T](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m16s)

[because the problem is is I can't do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m25s)

[yeah because I think I then have to go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m30s)

[and implement this as because the as](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m31s)

[right now wants to return a visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m34s)

[element of T element and in my case my T](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m35s)

[includes visual element. So I think this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m38s)

[is what I need here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m42s)

[I'm wondering if this should just be a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m49s)

[straight return or if this should be a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m50s)

[null conditional check. Can't decide. Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m51s)

[but for now, let's go and actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m55s)

[implement the as because that's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m56s)

[functionally what we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h18m59s)

[needing is an as here. So we need to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m00s)

[expand this so that there is a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m04s)

[non-generic overload](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m09s)

[to convert the element to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m10s)

[a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m15s)

[uh typed element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m20s)

[So, I think what's what's going to end](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m32s)

[up needing to happen here is this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m34s)

[going to have to be uh let's see type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m36s)

[element type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m45s)

[then we need to do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m47s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m50s)

[do a param element type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m54s)

[the type uh to convert to this must be a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h19m57s)

[drive type of let's see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m06s)

[dref uh dependency object and so we'll](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m11s)

[do something of that nature.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m16s)

[Hey, Bruce. No, I appreciate the kind](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m22s)

[words. Off to work. Happy coding.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m25s)

[Thank you for dropping in. And yeah, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m28s)

[can appreciate that my uh stream time is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m30s)

[really obnoxious for a lot of people.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m32s)

[Unfortunately, it's based largely around](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m35s)

[my family schedule after my kids have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m37s)

[gone to bed. And so, I realize I am](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m38s)

[targeting English-speaking developers.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m41s)

[And unfortunately, I stream at an hour](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m44s)

[when most English- speakaking developers](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m46s)

[are either working or sleeping. is very](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m48s)

[inconvenient for my stream numbers, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m51s)

[when you do it for fun, it's okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m55s)

[Okay, so now I want visual element to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h20m58s)

[have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m01s)

[that as function that I can use.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m03s)

[Where is there? There, there, there. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m07s)

[I need I need my as function to exist](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m10s)

[and then I can implement it non](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m14s)

[generically all the way through. Where](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m17s)

[did my as function go? Am](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m19s)

[I blind or stupid?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m23s)

[There it is. Okay. So, public eye visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m27s)

[element as](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m32s)

[let's see type uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m34s)

[element type and we're off to the races.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m38s)

[Okay. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m42s)

[we would like this thing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m45s)

[to leverage some of the same convert](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m47s)

[logic that we have here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m49s)

[because ultimately this is the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h21m58s)

[I need to pull some of this out into a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m09s)

[non-generic version. Let's go here and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m12s)

[we're just going to duplicate it for the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m14s)

[moment. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m16s)

[type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m20s)

[target type.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m22s)

[Um, let's see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m25s)

[I visual element. We'll do that. We get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m28s)

[rid of that because that's not a thing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m31s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m33s)

[We get rid of that because that's not a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m35s)

[thing anymore. and we get rid of that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m37s)

[because that's not a thing anymore.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m40s)

[And then we bring this guy up here and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m43s)

[we do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m47s)

[return](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m50s)

[convert type of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m52s)

[e visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m55s)

[and then we put in the hard cast of t](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h22m58s)

[visual element and then all of this goes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m00s)

[away. Now we've got shared code between](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m03s)

[the two generic and non-generic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m06s)

[overloads.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m08s)

[Guess they're not really overloads, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m10s)

[work with me here. And so this then just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m12s)

[becomes a lambda based](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m15s)

[one where we go convert and then we just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m18s)

[pass element type.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m21s)

[And that goes like that. That now works.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m25s)

[Property now leverages it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m29s)

[And I can't do it as T.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m38s)

[I have to hard cast T](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m41s)

[um because it's going to return what I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m45s)

[expect or otherwise](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m48s)

[because we know in this case T is an I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m53s)

[visual element of T and we know this guy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m55s)

[is going to return me a visual element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h23m57s)

[Okay, I think that works.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m01s)

[Proof is in the pudding. Let's try the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m05s)

[skin.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m06s)

[Yeah, I'm from Europe and don't speak](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m09s)

[English very well. I'm a hobbyist, Dev,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m11s)

[but I've learned a lot from you about](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m13s)

[WPF. Need to go. Thanks a lot. No](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m15s)

[problem, Bruce. I appreciate the kind](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m18s)

[words. I appreciate it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m19s)

[I do I do love my uh my WPF.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m25s)

[was even discussing it with a colleague](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m29s)

[earlier today of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m31s)

[somewhat lamenting that it feels like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m34s)

[WPF is a dying skill set](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m35s)

[because it still feels very viable.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m42s)

[Okay, so we go there. Element type in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m46s)

[this case should be dependency object.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m48s)

[Great. We go in here. We go in here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m50s)

[We come in here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m54s)

[Oh, this guy. Izzy, merry Christmas and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h24m59s)

[thank you for your ping. I I do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m03s)

[completely apologize. It has been](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m05s)

[I I had technical difficulties with my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m09s)

[PC and then in my haste I apparently](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m11s)

[failed to click the start streaming](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m17s)

[button, which is not a great way to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m19s)

[start your stream. Pretty bad way to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m21s)

[start your stream in fact. uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m23s)

[sent it just as I was getting in the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m27s)

[car. Well, I appreciate it cuz I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m29s)

[know how long I would have gone because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m31s)

[I I looked at I'm like, "Oh, I've got a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m32s)

[new message." Oh, look. It's Oh, yeah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m34s)

[That was kind of the way that went. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m37s)

[not my not my finest moment. We'll put](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m41s)

[it that way.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m43s)

[Um, let's see here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m46s)

[So this guy here actually is somewhat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m49s)

[problematic because he wants to do so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m52s)

[he's actually trying to pull the element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m55s)

[type out and this thing already has the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m57s)

[element type. So I need to separate this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h25m59s)

[a little bit because this isn't quite](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m02s)

[the same.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m05s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m07s)

[so I actually want to move more of this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m11s)

[back up than what I originally thought.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m13s)

[Um let's see here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m17s)

[So this is type uh target type gets type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m20s)

[of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m26s)

[visual element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m28s)

[Uh assume the rest of the stream will](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m32s)

[will push to YouTube. I actually kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m34s)

[just started over. Um it it ended up](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m36s)

[working well for me because I I uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m40s)

[didn't hit start streaming. I was also](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m43s)

[not recording either because I have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m45s)

[those two things linked. So when I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m46s)

[hit the start streaming button, I also](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m49s)

[don't get the recording either. So I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m51s)

[kind of just backed up and started from](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m54s)

[where I had left off, which is somewhat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m56s)

[disappointing. But on the note of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h26m58s)

[YouTube, if anybody is interested, I did](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m00s)

[do an interview with Mads Toransson, uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m02s)

[the lead designer of the C team. That](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m04s)

[video comes out on my YouTube this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m07s)

[weekend. Uh but if you want early access](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m10s)

[to it, there is a link on my discord](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m12s)

[under the uh the events channel. So you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m15s)

[can go and check it out early if you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m19s)

[want to go grab it. So it is out there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m21s)

[It was awesome. I had a great time](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m24s)

[talking with Mads.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m26s)

[Very kind of him to be willing to sit](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m29s)

[down with me and I was I I thoroughly](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m30s)

[enjoyed myself.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m34s)

[Um, okay. So, this guy, this is actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m37s)

[not target type. This is actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m40s)

[element type here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m42s)

[So, I don't need this. I don't need](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m44s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m47s)

[I just need this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m49s)

[It's all I want.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m52s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m55s)

[a short video rewatch then will give me](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m58s)

[a chance to catch up on. Good. Yes, it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h27m59s)

[it will it will be a well, I hope it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m03s)

[going to be a little bit shorter. I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m05s)

[I'm hoping to go through and fix this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m06s)

[The short version is we I got the So, uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m08s)

[between last stream and this stream, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m12s)

[got the the unit test generator up and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m13s)

[running. Um but then realized that I had](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m15s)

[on my master branch, I was not actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m20s)

[testing all the methods. And so once I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m22s)

[realized that my new version actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m25s)

[was testing all the methods and some of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m27s)

[them were failing, I'm like, well crap,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m28s)

[now I can't let that go now that I know](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m30s)

[it. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m32s)

[so this needs to throw. So, so now we're](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m35s)

[actually trying to fix them all. Throw](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m38s)

[new invalid operation exception. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m39s)

[then uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m43s)

[could not convert](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m50s)

[element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m52s)

[to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m54s)

[uh let's do this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h28m57s)

[not convert element to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m00s)

[target element type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m03s)

[and then I want to do like this and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m07s)

[I want to do element type dot full name](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m09s)

[something of that nature. That'll](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m12s)

[that'll deal with that. This guy here, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m14s)

[just want to return](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m17s)

[convert, but I want to pass in the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m20s)

[element type here. That goes there. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m22s)

[now I'm trying to avoid having too much](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m26s)

[duplication.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m28s)

[Uh, and then this just needs to be cast](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m32s)

[a T visual element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m34s)

[there. That goes like that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m37s)

[Okay. So now that gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m40s)

[Back to my test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m44s)

[Rerun the test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m46s)

[So now it should actually drop in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m53s)

[properly.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h29m55s)

[these are actually visual element type.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h30m20s)

[That might be better. Or well, we we'll](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h30m24s)

[mean there's your model numbers,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h32m53s)

[but I don't know that that actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h32m57s)

[uh, with the controller and Windows.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m03s)

[Yeah. And that's part of why I went out](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m04s)

[on my motherboard and went uh hunting](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m06s)

[for updated BIOS ones. And what got my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m09s)

[attention is there was a BIOS update for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m12s)

[my motherboard this month. Um and they](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m16s)

[specifically there was a comment in the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m20s)

[release notes about the TPM chip for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m22s)

[particular games and that got me hopeful](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m24s)

[that that might fix my problem. Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m26s)

[hope there were not Bit Locker problems.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m31s)

[No, but I will say the motherboard](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m32s)

[firmware update did strongly recommend](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m34s)

[backing up your bit locker keys before](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m37s)

[uh doing it, which I promptly did, which](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m39s)

[isn't a big deal. I I keep them saved](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m44s)

[off](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m46s)

[the fact that I it keeps having trouble](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m55s)

[posting on boot is scaring me. And so it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h33m57s)

[it is I think I've had this for eight](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m02s)

[years now.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m05s)

[Like it is um it is it is a little bit](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m07s)

[off. Um because it's an it's an MSI](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m11s)

[motherboard.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m19s)

[Uh let's see. Some sorted itself in the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m21s)

[later updates, but some disc need](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m23s)

[firmware to fix it. They have not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m25s)

[announced it widely. Uh because no one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m27s)

[wants to take the blame. Oh, okay. That](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m30s)

[is good to know. I will go and hunt my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m33s)

[I I will go and hunt and see if there's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m38s)

[something extra for my M2 then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m39s)

[because I have not tried that. It's just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m43s)

[incredibly frustrating because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m45s)

[um was it a day or two ago? I spent two](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m48s)

[hours in various reboot loops until all](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m52s)

[of a sudden it just worked. And I have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h34m56s)

[no idea what I did differently. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m00s)

[pressed the reboot button with more](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m03s)

[feeling that second time around, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m04s)

[guess, or something of that nature. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m06s)

[and it it just it it frustrated me to no](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m10s)

[end. Let's see. Uh, visual element type,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m14s)

[but that is good to know.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m22s)

[been trudging with my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m25s)

[think that's partner PC for 6 months](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m28s)

[because of this and it solved itself but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m31s)

[spent a lot of time looking into it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m33s)

[Yes, I I feel like that's the state that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m35s)

[I am in is I have been fighting with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m39s)

[this. It's like I don't really want to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m41s)

[build a new PC right now.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m44s)

[I've got other stuff I'd rather be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m46s)

[doing, but not having a PC working is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m48s)

[going to inhibit my ability to do the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m51s)

[other stuff. So, it may get thrust upon](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m53s)

[me whether I want it to be or not.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h35m56s)

[Okay. So, I want to change this guy up.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m00s)

[Um because rather than doing this get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m06s)

[generic type arguments if this thing is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m09s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m12s)

[Um I think what I want to do is just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m14s)

[pass this in and let the code on the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m17s)

[sure that's how most of the build](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m27s)

[working.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m30s)

[I don't know that I was sneezing, but I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m32s)

[was definitely coughing out angry um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m34s)

[sounds. There was definitely that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m37s)

[I can assure you that that was the case.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m41s)

[Okay, I think I like doing this better.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m43s)

[That way there's at least a little bit](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m45s)

[of symmetry between these two things in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m47s)

[terms of what they're doing. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m49s)

[this guy here,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m55s)

[this comes in here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h36m58s)

[And this comes in here. And then this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m01s)

[goes up here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m04s)

[And then this goes away.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m07s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m11s)

[I don't need this stuff here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m13s)

[Um, we're going to rename this guy to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m17s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m20s)

[Uh, var. Well, I guess let's do this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m23s)

[Visual element type. this thing here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m27s)

[because I think that makes it obvious](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m30s)

[what the checks are for here. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m32s)

[this exception](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m34s)

[um cannot convert](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m38s)

[visual element of T.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m44s)

[I don't know that this is actually the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m49s)

[message that I want. Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m51s)

[but I mean this guy knows what he is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m56s)

[Not convert object to visual element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h37m59s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m08s)

[make generic type. Well actually this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m10s)

[now visual element type. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m13s)

[we can actually just do that and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m18s)

[that goes like that. That goes like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m21s)

[that. And then this guy doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m23s)

[do anything fancy. We can just do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m25s)

[this return statement here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m29s)

[And then all of this goes away. That](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m33s)

[makes me feel better. That makes me feel](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m35s)

[better. Uh this becomes type of t visual](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m37s)

[element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m43s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m51s)

[Okay. So now if I run you, you should](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m53s)

[pass is the goal.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h38m56s)

[And then we'll go see what else is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m00s)

[broken](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m01s)

[because some of these are potentially](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m04s)

[just properties with return types that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m06s)

[aren't valid for us to return. And so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m09s)

[it's okay. There's that. Okay, that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m11s)

[handles that. Next failure. Show me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m14s)

[What was this one?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m29s)

[Okay. So, let's find this one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m32s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m36s)

[I think that's UI element has allowed](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m38s)

[drop if I remember right.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m40s)

[what your problem is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m50s)

[always a nice first step.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h39m55s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m00s)

[let's see. Failed to find child element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m01s)

[with name.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m04s)

[So, it is failing.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m07s)

[What is this test doing exactly?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m10s)

[Get element with test UI element](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m14s)

[is UI element nonabstract.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m20s)

[That really true.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m23s)

[That surprises me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m26s)

[I thought you were](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m29s)

[thought you were abstract. Can I really](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m31s)

[in my ZAML just do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m34s)

[Oh, I totally straight up can.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m37s)

[That seems wrong.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m42s)

[That seems very very wrong. I think this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m46s)

[is probably a case where we just want to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m49s)

[be able to override](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m51s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m53s)

[I think that's what I want.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h40m58s)

[Trying to decide how to go about doing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m02s)

[this because the simplest thing is a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m04s)

[partial, but I I almost want a partial.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m07s)

[Yeah, I hope you get it sorted. Uh, so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m11s)

[frustrating to have a half random bug](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m13s)

[with no error dumb file.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m15s)

[I can read comment blue screen x64 old](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m18s)

[app, but just works very well looking up](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m21s)

[dumb files](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m23s)

[and various problems. Yeah. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m26s)

[Believe me, it is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m28s)

[has caused me no end of frustration](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m30s)

[recently. And it because it happened](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m32s)

[right after I recorded my interview with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m34s)

[Mads. Like the first time, well, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m36s)

[shouldn't say the first time because it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m40s)

[happened once like a month ago and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m43s)

[when it came back up and was working, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m46s)

[was like, that's weird.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m48s)

[And then it happened again multiple](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m50s)

[times this week, which is what's making](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m52s)

[me somewhat think that something's on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m55s)

[its way out and why I'm somewhat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h41m57s)

[thinking motherboard. But I don't know](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m01s)

[that for a fact because then my problem](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m02s)

[is do I buy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m04s)

[do I just upgrade effectively all my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m08s)

[components, right? motherboard, CPU,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m10s)

[RAM, and bring bring all the stuff up to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m12s)

[something a little newer because I am](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m15s)

[running a slightly older setup. It's an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m18s)

[AM4 socket. I could I could upgrade to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m20s)

[the latest sockets, newer CPU. I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m24s)

[have bad specs. I've got 32 gigs of RAM,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m27s)

[but it's DDR4, not DDR5. Like, well, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m30s)

[could just buy a new motherboard with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m34s)

[the old socket. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m35s)

[yeah. Yes. And now one month with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m39s)

[nothing and then and then a series again](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m41s)

[is is what her PC did. Yeah. It's so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m44s)

[frustrating. So incredibly frustrating.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m46s)

[Okay. So I Yeah. And that's that's why](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m52s)

[it's one of those it's like do I do I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m55s)

[upgrade](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m57s)

[the rest of my components to go with it?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h42m58s)

[That way I can just rev everything](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m01s)

[forward and be something new and latest](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m02s)

[and feel warm and fuzzy about it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m04s)

[Maybe.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m08s)

[Maybe that's a good idea.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m09s)

[It's a tough call because I could also](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m12s)

[get a new motherboard and then it um I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m15s)

[replaced a PSU. Yeah. Well, that's the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m18s)

[other thing is like my power supply I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m21s)

[think is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m23s)

[650 watts, which isn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m25s)

[like it's not bad, but it's not huge by](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m30s)

[any means. So, it's like, well, if I if](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m32s)

[I upgrade the motherboard, maybe the the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m35s)

[PSU should go with it. It's like, uhh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m37s)

[I'm very quickly going to be into a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m40s)

[brand new PC very quickly. It's like,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m42s)

[and I don't like, especially with RAM](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m45s)

[prices spiking, like I don't really want](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m48s)

[to be in the market for one of those.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m50s)

[Let's see. She had an ASUS 1000 watt](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m53s)

[with a 10-year warranty. Dang.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h43m57s)

[See, and that's kind of where I would be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m00s)

[leaning potentially is jumping up to a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m02s)

[thousand just to make sure I've got more](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m04s)

[than enough because like my 650](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m06s)

[was rated to cover everything. The only](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m10s)

[thing I've upgraded since I first built](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m12s)

[it was my graphics card](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m14s)

[and but I was still I think well within](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m17s)

[um because like PC part builder they](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m21s)

[give you your your estimates of what you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m22s)

[need for power and I was still within](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m24s)

[um spec for what it should should have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m27s)

[been able to handle. was like, "Okay,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m29s)

[I've got a little bit of a ceiling. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m30s)

[should be fine." But I don't know. Maybe](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m32s)

[maybe it could be the PSU.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m34s)

[It's like, h I get into the midst of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m37s)

[doing this, I may end up just building a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m40s)

[whole brand new computer by the end of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m42s)

[it, which is very, very exciting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m44s)

[Okay. So, I suspect my problem here is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m47s)

[with the I I'm willing to bet all of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m50s)

[UI element ones fail because I don't my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m52s)

[ZAML test relies on being able to find](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m56s)

[elements in the visual tree and the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h44m58s)

[visual tree is framework element based](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m00s)

[and I don't think any of these are going](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m03s)

[to find. So, I kind of suspect all of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m05s)

[these will just fail out.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m07s)

[I'm tempted. I'm trying to decide. Do I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m11s)

[I think what I want because I like these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m15s)

[tests going against the extension](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m17s)

[methods, but I think I just need to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m19s)

[change this up so that it actually uses](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m21s)

[framework element instead of UI element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m23s)

[So I need to leave myself a hook to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m26s)

[override the content.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m28s)

[Um, and I don't quite know the best way](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m31s)

[to do it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m35s)

[I would start with the firmware and the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m38s)

[PSU before a new PC because of current](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m39s)

[prices. Yeah, I I can agree with that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m42s)

[cuz I was I was briefly looking at stuff](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m47s)

[and I'm like, "Holy cow." Cuz the this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m49s)

[machine when I first bought it, I paid](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m51s)

[less than 500 bucks. Now, admittedly, it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m53s)

[was a um I bought it from uh a private](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h45m56s)

[party who for fun, he builds PCs for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m00s)

[people and sells them. Um but nice guy.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m03s)

[trusted him. Like he had a good setup,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m07s)

[did a great job. Like I've been very](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m12s)

[happy with it. But now with the the cost](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m14s)

[of prices and stuff, like I should](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m17s)

[potentially follow up with him. But I I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m19s)

[think he's stopped building them for fun](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m21s)

[in his spare time because before he](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m23s)

[could, you know, pick stuff up on sell,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m25s)

[put together a decent PC and flip it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m27s)

[And he wouldn't make a ton of profit,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m30s)

[but he'd make a little bit. But I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m31s)

[haven't seen him list anything in a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m34s)

[while now. And I kind of wonder if the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m35s)

[price has kind of priced them out of it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m37s)

[I really need some way to just change](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m41s)

[that bit of the string.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m43s)

[That bit of the string](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m47s)

[because I could partial it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m50s)

[And maybe that's the way to do it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m53s)

[Actually, that's exactly how we should](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m57s)

[do it. Okay. So, what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h46m59s)

[is we're going to come over here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m01s)

[We are going to change the generated](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m04s)

[string here to do something of uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m06s)

[because we have this get window content](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m10s)

[where it does all of this stuff.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m14s)

[Wait a minute. What can I just use the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m19s)

[get window content on this?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m21s)

[Because this takes in content and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m24s)

[outputs other content. Oh, so I've](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m26s)

[already left myself the hook that I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m29s)

[need. Oh, this is easy. Then all I need](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m30s)

[to do is come over here in you for a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m33s)

[second. Hold still. Sit still for me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m36s)

[Come in here and I just come in here and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m38s)

[I go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m40s)

[partial class. Paste. Oh, I already](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m43s)

[grabbed the partial class.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m46s)

[So I do that. Do that. Come over here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m48s)

[Move you to your own file.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m50s)

[Boom. Come on. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m53s)

[this guy here, we can just do something](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h47m58s)

[like this. And then window actually I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m00s)

[want the I want to do this in a static](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m04s)

[constructor don't I because window](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m05s)

[content is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m07s)

[uh what was it? Get window content.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m10s)

[Uh and this goes like this. This goes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m14s)

[like this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m16s)

[Stop it. Stop helping me. Right. So we](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m18s)

[can just override all of the window](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m21s)

[content that it's going to use. And what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m25s)

[I really want to do is this is the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m27s)

[original string and I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m31s)

[change it. So I could I could bring in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m32s)

[the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m35s)

[I could do something fancy where I use X](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m37s)

[for something, but I think we're just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m39s)

[going to not use it. We'll do that. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m40s)

[we'll just do framework element.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m43s)

[And now](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m48s)

[I think those other tests should work.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m50s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m54s)

[See,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m57s)

[not not viable at the moment. Yeah, did](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h48m58s)

[that to my main focus for many years.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m01s)

[I've been a support and fixing PC, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m03s)

[people just got hard to deal with. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m05s)

[now I'm just coding. Yeah, I can totally](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m07s)

[understand that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m09s)

[I can totally understand that. Like it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m12s)

[one of those things. For a long time, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m15s)

[thought I wanted to go in and be like a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m17s)

[work in IT, but I don't know that I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m20s)

[would enjoy like I enjoy parts of the of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m23s)

[being like an IT tech, but there's a lot](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m27s)

[of it that I don't enjoy.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m29s)

[So, okay, that handles 36 of the airs.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m32s)

[Okay. So, these ones are all going to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m36s)

[same failures.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m40s)

[Yes. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m43s)

[going get clip get desired size](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m47s)

[as animated properties.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m52s)

[I'm tempted to also make my life a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h49m56s)

[little easier by changing the name of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m00s)

[these tests to include the class name in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m01s)

[them just so I don't have to go hunt](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m04s)

[that down.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m05s)

[Like I can I can figure it out by](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m07s)

[looking at this, but it seems like it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m09s)

[might be nicer just to put it in the the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m10s)

[test method name as well. Maybe that's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m14s)

[overkill.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m16s)

[I'm I'm really just checking and looking](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m19s)

[it which as long as I keep seeing UI](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m21s)

[element right here. I'm just skipping](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m24s)

[because we just fixed all those.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m26s)

[We may be close to the end considering](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m29s)

[there was what 39 of those. figure two](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m31s)

[failed messages per 39.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m35s)

[That's 70 something. And then we already](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m38s)

[fixed the other two.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m41s)

[Uh dependency object generator. Ah, so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m43s)

[this one's probably almost the exact](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m46s)

[same issue.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m48s)

[So that guy doesn't surprise me. Yeah, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m50s)

[used to build computers and laptops.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m54s)

[Managed to get a good laptop once for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m55s)

[spares and turned out it just needed a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h50m57s)

[good clean out. See, I would love to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m00s)

[find one of those.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m02s)

[My best one at one point is there's um I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m04s)

[don't know if it's popular elsewhere in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m08s)

[the world, but there is a a site called](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m10s)

[Craigslist here in the US where uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m12s)

[people can just list and sell things.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m16s)

[Um and I had found a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m19s)

[I'm guessing he was early 20s. Um but he](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m22s)

[the guy was selling an an Alienware](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m26s)

[laptop and this was like Alien Wares](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m28s)

[were the bomb. This was many years back,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m30s)

[but he didn't know what he had. He](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m34s)

[thought He's like, "Yeah, I don't use](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m36s)

[computers much." I think he was going to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m37s)

[school to be a mechanic or something.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m40s)

[He's like, "I don't use computers much.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m41s)

[I'm just trying to unload it." It was](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m43s)

[given as a gift to me and he wanted only](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m44s)

[a few hundred bucks for it. Oh, I felt](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m46s)

[like I stole that thing from him. He was](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m48s)

[kind of flaky to get him to meet up with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m50s)

[me, but once he did, I was tickled at](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m52s)

[because I expected to sit down with the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m55s)

[machine and there'd be something majorly](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m57s)

[wrong with it. And it was it was](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h51m58s)

[awesome.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m01s)

[Yeah, enjoyed it for many years. But](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m03s)

[people think you can do magic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m06s)

[and they turn now and it and it ready in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m09s)

[10 minutes and if anything goes wrong](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m12s)

[the next three months it's your fault](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m14s)

[and they want a new one for free. Yep.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m15s)

[Uh and when you do it private, it's just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m18s)

[not worth your time. Just do it for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m20s)

[friends now. Yeah. And that's kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m22s)

[the way it's worked out for me. Like I I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m23s)

[will certainly go and help friends out](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m25s)

[and I've got a lot of family members](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m27s)

[that are not very techsavvy. So I do it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m28s)

[for them most of the time because it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m31s)

[easy and because I can't get rid of them](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m33s)

[even if I wanted to. Yeah. See Izzy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m35s)

[opened it up. Clogged the fan and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m38s)

[meshes. New thermal paste. Total cost](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m40s)

[was 100 pounds. Managed to sell it for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m42s)

[1,500. That was an Alienware one, too.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m45s)

[Yeah. I will say my Alienware laptop, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m47s)

[love that thing to death. Um, I was once](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m50s)

[in a motorcycle accident. Um, I was on a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m52s)

[motorcycle against a large Ford pickup,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m57s)

[an F-150. Uh, pro tip, they hurt. Don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h52m59s)

[go in front of them on a motorcycle. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m03s)

[especially at about 30 m hour. It will](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m06s)

[hurt. It will break your leg and you'll](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m08s)

[probably dislocate your shoulder and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m10s)

[have major lacerations on your feet,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m12s)

[hypothetically. Uh, but my Alienware](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m14s)

[made it through with just a small chip](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m17s)

[on the corner because it was in a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m19s)

[backpack on my back at the time and it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m21s)

[100% survived and I used it for three,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m24s)

[four years after that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m26s)

[So, like I will say Alienware was](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m29s)

[expensive, but they at least back in the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m33s)

[day they made some good stuff. They](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m35s)

[absolutely made some good stuff.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m38s)

[Okay. So, this guy here is going to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m42s)

[the same same doohickey is we just need](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m44s)

[to hijack](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m47s)

[the return. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m49s)

[um that is not what we want to do. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m53s)

[want to grab](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h53m56s)

[Oh, that's pretty close actually, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m00s)

[it's not quite what I want.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m02s)

[Uh nope. Nope. So, I want this guy here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m05s)

[And then I want you to be framework](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m12s)

[element as well.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m14s)

[And then and then we'll put you in your](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m17s)

[own class.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m19s)

[Boom. And then that should fix that one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m22s)

[I expect you to pass now.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m26s)

[Go green.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m30s)

[At least now I have tests over all my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m32s)

[things.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m34s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m36s)

[oh. Society dog. Thank you very much. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m38s)

[appreciate that. I may take you up on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m40s)

[that. Like I know enough to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m41s)

[dangerous, but I would not consider](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h54m43s)

[call motorcyclists? Oh boy. I know what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m02s)

[I got called. Um there was idiot. Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m05s)

[I'm trying to remember. They they had](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m11s)

[not wrong.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m21s)

[Yeah. I I think without fail every](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m24s)

[medical professional I ran into while](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m27s)

[after my motorcycle instant uh accident](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m29s)

[use some form of you're an idiot.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m33s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m39s)

[Okay. So, that should fix it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m42s)

[Okay. Let's see if this does it. That](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m45s)

[that that in theory hits all the tests.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m47s)

[Okay. Commit. Send it. Then we'll let](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m55s)

[this guy go. And then hopefully this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h55m58s)

[puts the ZAML test changes to bed.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m00s)

[Should be cool. should absolutely be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m03s)

[cool. Why do I have seven pull requests?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m06s)

[Oh, yeah, the dependent bot ones. Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m09s)

[I was like, "Holy crap."](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m12s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m16s)

[chug for a minute.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m21s)

[Okay. And while that guy's going, I may](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m26s)

[jump over here and take a brief look at](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m28s)

[some Automacher stuff. So my automarker](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m30s)

[library I have been slowly adding things](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m34s)

[to um and if anybody is using it I feel](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m36s)

[the urge to show this off. So underneath](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m40s)

[docs because I started writing up](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m42s)

[documentation for this is I have source](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m45s)

[generators that I am leveraging for the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m48s)

[purpose of generating out additional](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m51s)

[code. Right? And so the unit test one is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m54s)

[mostly there as a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h56m57s)

[way to mock people who have minimum uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m00s)

[requirements for code coverage.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m04s)

[Um but the actual interesting ones are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m06s)

[things like the eye option stuff. Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m08s)

[because what the what the source](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m11s)

[generator does is it watches for when um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m13s)

[you use the automarker library in a test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m17s)

[project that also references extension](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m20s)

[options. And so if it sees that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m22s)

[reference, it will generate out the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m25s)

[your unit test. So it's a way of me](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m30s)

[adding](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m32s)

[um extra functionality to automacher but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m34s)

[conditionally adding it so that I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m37s)

[have to build a bunch of dependent](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m39s)

[nougat packages because normally what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m40s)

[people would do is they'd build you know](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m42s)

[derived nougat packages that take a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m44s)

[dependency on the automakerbased library](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m46s)

[and a dependency on I the uh the options](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m48s)

[library. I'm like that's stupid.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m51s)

[Um, so unfortunately it makes my life](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m53s)

[harder because I have to build a source](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m56s)

[generator rather than just a a new CS](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h57m58s)

[project, but I think it's a lot cleaner](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m00s)

[uh in my opinion and it goes through.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m03s)

[There's also um if you don't like the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m06s)

[generators, you can just turn them off.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m09s)

[Like there's MS build switches. I turn](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m11s)

[them on by default. I I argued with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m13s)

[myself for a long time about what the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m16s)

[proper default should be and decided](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m18s)

[that if they were off by default, no one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m20s)

[would ever find them or use them. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m22s)

[and figured that having them on by](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m25s)

[default and it did cause a handful of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m27s)

[issues to get logged. I kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m29s)

[suspected it would bite me. Um, but it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m31s)

[it ended up being a good thing um to do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m33s)

[I think in my opinion. So there's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m38s)

[support for logging, keyed services, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m39s)

[options, and application insights. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m42s)

[the one that I'm currently working on is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m45s)

[HTTP client as well because I want like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m46s)

[having built-in support for being able](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m51s)

[to deal with HTTP client. Like there's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m53s)

[all these types that everybody just kind](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m55s)

[of wants anyway. And so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h58m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m16s)

[so I do have I do have a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m18s)

[where is it? I think I I think I had it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m23s)

[open. Yeah. So I do have this HTTP](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m25s)

[client one on here and it is largely](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m28s)

[based on the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m31s)

[like I heavily heavily poached design](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m34s)

[from this other library](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m38s)

[um from the mock contribs library.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m41s)

[Um, but this guy hasn't been touched in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m45s)

[four years](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m48s)

[and I I I wanted updates for it and I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m51s)

[and I needed extra stuff. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=00h59m55s)

[like this is often times one of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m00s)

[tools that I reach for when I when I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m01s)

[want to be able to do things, but I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m05s)

[yeah, there was just a handful of things](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m08s)

[where I I wanted these things to be a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m09s)

[little bit cleaner, but it has it has](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m11s)

[basically the mock type interface that I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m14s)

[think is mostly what people expect,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m17s)

[right? with I want to set up something](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m19s)

[for an HTTP request or you know have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m21s)

[nice overloads for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m25s)

[um just passing in a URI or a string and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m27s)

[say hey if this gets called here's the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m30s)

[response don't think too hard just send](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m32s)

[this back right and so all it does is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m34s)

[inject an HTTP handler inside of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m36s)

[HTTP client that just shortcircuits and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m39s)

[sends things back that way you can go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m42s)

[through and test it and you could in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m44s)

[theory also leverage it to trigger like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m45s)

[poly retries or otherwise is right.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m48s)

[Depending on how uh you want to go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m50s)

[through and leverage it. So that isn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m52s)

[that isn't bad there. And I I kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m55s)

[like it especially for situations like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h00m58s)

[this cuz it's like oftenimes people mock](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m00s)

[away their HTTP client and I just don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m04s)

[like that. It it doesn't feel good to me](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m07s)

[because HTTP client is already kind of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m10s)

[an abstraction.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m12s)

[Um, so it's like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m14s)

[yeah, so I very heavily leeched API and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m17s)

[similar from it. Uhoh, we just fail](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m20s)

[again. I think we just failed again.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m22s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m26s)

[well, the good news is the test passed.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m30s)

[So that's that's a good sign. Um, let's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m33s)

[see. The icon file icon png does not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m36s)

[exist in the package.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h01m38s)

[I probably applied my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m29s)

[I bet you I copied in stuff from my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m33s)

[template is probably what I did, which](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m35s)

[was which was brilliant and horrible.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m38s)

[all at the same time. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m40s)

[so where is So I guess the question is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m45s)

[where is my icon? Because I know I have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m48s)

[an icon. Pop this. I don't see it. Uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m51s)

[it must be here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h02m56s)

[Okay. So it's not icon. So one it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h03m00s)

[capital I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h03m03s)

[and two it is from the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h03m05s)

[from the CSR](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h03m11s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h17m55s)

[And now I bet you it builds](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h17m57s)

[or packs](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m01s)

[because there was a change somewhere. Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m05s)

[let's see. That's a dot slash. Did I not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m08s)

[change it in? Oh, I didn't hit save on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m12s)

[this one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m14s)

[And I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m17s)

[this just becomes icon because I believe](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m21s)

[package icon is relative to the nougat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m23s)

[into](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m29s)

[just the root of the Nougat package,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m32s)

[I believe that's what it's going to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m36s)

[looking for.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m37s)

[We'll know in a minute. Okay, build](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m39s)

[succeeded.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m41s)

[Uh let's see here. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m43s)

[let's do so that fixes that problem](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m47s)

[and then is part of the next unshipped](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m51s)

[but is not a supported.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m55s)

[So, let's go deal with this guy, too.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h18m59s)

[Hold on. What is this telling me? It's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m16s)

[part of the next unchipped analyzer](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m18s)

[What do you mean it's not supported](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m25s)

[diagnostic for any analyzer? Yes, it is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m27s)

[I I get all of that but where how do it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m47s)

[know it's not part of any analyzer? Have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m51s)

[I not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h19m54s)

[Impress me, co-pilot.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h20m49s)

[exciting. Show it to me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h20m56s)

[Let's see. The issue is that you have an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m02s)

[incremental generator, not a diagnostic](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m04s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m07s)

[oh. But the Roslin release tracking](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m10s)

[analyzer expect diagnostic rules to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m13s)

[declared and diagnostic analyzer](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m15s)

[supported diagnostics](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m17s)

[uh that declares these diagnostics.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m22s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m26s)

[Create a simple diagnostics analyzer](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m28s)

[and registers these um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m31s)

[What did what did you just create?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m42s)

[Ah,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m49s)

[so because my generator is pushing these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m51s)

[things out, it doesn't know about them.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m54s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h21m59s)

[Okay. Are you done, Copilot? Are you Are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m01s)

[you still thinking?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m03s)

[Okay. So you did, so you made those](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m05s)

[internal and then intentionally just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m08s)

[slapped them into](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m10s)

[that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m13s)

[private to internal. Yeah, sure. Fine.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m15s)

[Okay, we'll clean this up a little bit.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m18s)

[Uh, use collection expressions because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m21s)

[that's better.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m23s)

[Yeah, I like that a little bit better.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m27s)

[And then let's confirm that we actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m29s)

[see those things go away.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m32s)

[And then it should just work. At least](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m35s)

[that's the hope. That is the hope.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m39s)

[Oh, what a shot. Co-pilot, you're](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h22m54s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h23m11s)

[trying to remember what the point of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h23m14s)

[having to put these things in was cuz I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h23m16s)

[don't really want them.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h23m19s)

[reason he shouldn't. I don't understand](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m04s)

[why that one failed.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m07s)

[Um, I do want to double check my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m11s)

[go here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m15s)

[Net dash.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m18s)

[So, I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m23s)

[I think 1.02 may have the WPF fix in it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m29s)

[So, I may want to go back and briefly](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m33s)

[look at this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m36s)

[because I think that one is I think the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m42s)

[fix is in there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m44s)

[Me go back here and grab my PR.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m47s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m53s)

[Out origin.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h29m57s)

[And then let's drag you up. We're going](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m00s)

[to rebase you. Come on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m02s)

[Where's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m08s)

[I've lost](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m09s)

[master. There it is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m12s)

[Rebase.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m14s)

[Do the thing.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m16s)

[Okay. Uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m18s)

[take V6.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m22s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m25s)

[Get V6. And I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m29s)

[this still has net nine here. So, we](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m37s)

[might need to double check that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m40s)

[See? Six.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m44s)

[Six.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m47s)

[Okay. So, we'll do that. Can you rebase?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m50s)

[Okay. So, that gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h30m59s)

[you can see uh has been modified.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m02s)

[Discard.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m05s)

[Yeah. So, I I understand you are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m08s)

[unhappy. I've changed I moved your](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m10s)

[cheese.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m12s)

[Okay. Because did did I I I did go SLNX](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m14s)

[on this one. Did do it. Good. Ask Kevin](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m17s)

[knew what he was talking about.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m21s)

[And then we are going to bump this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m24s)

[sucker up because I think 1.0](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m27s)

[2 will fix this. Let's load this and see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m31s)

[if we actually build properly.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m35s)

[And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m42s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m44s)

[It updated. It's working. It's working.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m46s)

[Then that automerged and went out the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m51s)

[door.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m54s)

[And the master build is running now. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h31m56s)

[then it will go. Yay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m00s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m02s)

[What is your problem?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m05s)

[I immediately don't trust you.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m09s)

[I immediately don't trust you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m14s)

[because that only has an SLN X on the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m17s)

[end. That only has an X on the end](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m20s)

[and that has an X on the end. So, I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m24s)

[not real concerned about any of those.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m26s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m29s)

[Okay. So, what I want to change though](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m31s)

[is here 1.0](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m34s)

[102, which is why I was checking what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m37s)

[version. Uh, let's see. Net-list](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m39s)

[gays](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m44s)

[1.0.102](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m46s)

[because I think that's the kicker for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m48s)

[making sure that this guy has what he](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m50s)

[needs. And then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m53s)

[build artifacts.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h32m57s)

[It's just 10x, but I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m05s)

[I think that's fine.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m08s)

[Yeah. So, let's just push this and see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m12s)

[I think this will actually get the net](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m16s)

[10 stuff working.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m19s)

[I'll be very curious to see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m22s)

[what this does because I um they did](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m25s)

[find and fix the the WPF issue that I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m29s)

[got bit by right on release. And I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m32s)

[it made it out in this in this 102. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m35s)

[don't know for certain, but we will know](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m38s)

[more in a moment.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m40s)

[While that guy is going, as soon as ZAML](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m42s)

[test gets published, I'd like to pull it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m46s)

[in. Um though actually I'm realizing do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m49s)

[I have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m53s)

[do I have trusted publishing enabled? So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h33m56s)

[something new get added](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m01s)

[somewhat recently.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m04s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m09s)

[upload push nougat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m11s)

[nug get push source. No I'm still using](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m15s)

[the API key approach. So there is a cool](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m19s)

[thing called um trusted publishing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m23s)

[kind of like federated credentials. um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m27s)

[you're familiar with that from like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m31s)

[GitHub actions. I think it's here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m33s)

[So down here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m40s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m43s)

[where is the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m47s)

[I turned it on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m52s)

[for?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m56s)

[Not crazy. I did turn it on, didn't I?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h34m59s)

[Added it to my template.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m02s)

[Did not.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m08s)

[Did I not put it in the props?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m10s)

[I put it in the CS project.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m13s)

[I put this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m17s)

[No, it should have been in the props](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m19s)

[on main.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m22s)

[What? I did do this, didn't I?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m41s)

[Oh, it's it's ah, got it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m52s)

[Required for trusted publishing. There](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m56s)

[we go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h35m59s)

[Got it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m01s)

[Got it. So this guy here, um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m09s)

[but I still have API key here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m16s)

[Oh, that's this is correct because it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m20s)

[the output from here. Okay, let's see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m22s)

[Do you know of an example project that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m24s)

[restores WPF data grid sort order on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m26s)

[viewchain?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m29s)

[I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m42s)

[I'm trying to think if I if I have any](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m44s)

[examples because what you're probably](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m47s)

[looking for is I I assume you've got](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m49s)

[your data grid. Uh Copilot lost its mind](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m52s)

[when I asked. Yeah. So, what you're](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m56s)

[probably looking for is eye collection](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h36m58s)

[view.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m01s)

[go up here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m03s)

[Uh, let's see here. If I go I because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m06s)

[think I've got a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m12s)

[here I believe on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m18s)

[my data grid](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m22s)

[I should just look for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m28s)

[collection view.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m31s)

[Oh man, I've only got one instance of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m35s)

[collection view and it's on a combo box](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m38s)

[sample. That's not a good sign.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m40s)

[What you are probably looking to do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m44s)

[because I assume you've potentially](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m47s)

[already done this already is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m49s)

[have your data grid not necessarily](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m54s)

[bound to an observable collection but to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m56s)

[a collection view itself because the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h37m58s)

[collection view allows you to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m00s)

[um control the sort.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m03s)

[for example, down here um where you can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m06s)

[and here I'll just drop this in the chat](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m10s)

[um because this gives you effectively a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m14s)

[way of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m17s)

[controlling that sort. So when you say](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m19s)

[reset um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m22s)

[or or I guess restore uh data grid sort](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m25s)

[order restore to what like what the the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m28s)

[default was or similar like I think in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m31s)

[most cases what you are probably looking](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m34s)

[for is the obvious option is simply](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m37s)

[going through and clearing the sort](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m41s)

[descriptions from the collection view](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m44s)

[that's there. So if you end up binding](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m46s)

[because I I believe if I go look at the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m50s)

[view here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m52s)

[um you can you can bind yourself. In](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h38m58s)

[this case items is the collection view](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m01s)

[itself. And then once you have the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m03s)

[collection view which you typically get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m07s)

[by calling collection view source get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m09s)

[default view of your observable](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m11s)

[collection. This view gives you access](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m12s)

[to things like sort and filter. That way](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m15s)

[you can do what you need to. Oh, let's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m18s)

[see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m21s)

[Uh, let's see. Is email view got the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m24s)

[data grid](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m26s)

[box data grid?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m28s)

[Oh, main](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m33s)

[view.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m37s)

[the header which I assume is what has it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m41s)

[data grid.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m44s)

[So your phone items which I assume](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m47s)

[there's going to be a phone main view](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m49s)

[model.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m52s)

[Phone items is just an observable](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m54s)

[collection. So what I would probably](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m56s)

[tell you to do is create a new property](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h39m57s)

[here that's of type I collection view.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m00s)

[um very similar to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m04s)

[the effectively very similar to what um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m08s)

[I did here. So two properties you still](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m11s)

[have your observable collection which is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m13s)

[the thing you mutate](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m15s)

[um line 30.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m17s)

[Oh, you do have a list collection view.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m20s)

[Hang on. Hang on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m23s)

[Let's collection view filter.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m27s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m32s)

[sort descriptor to list?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m39s)

[you pull out the sort descriptors, but I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m47s)

[don't see because I I somewhat suspect](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m49s)

[that to restore the sort, you would end](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m52s)

[up just clearing the sort descriptors,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h40m55s)

[and that would get you back to whatever](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m00s)

[the default was, which effectively](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m01s)

[should be the same order as whatever's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m05s)

[in your observable collection.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m07s)

[Is is that not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m11s)

[because again I would assume you can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m13s)

[just clear this sort descriptors](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m15s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m16s)

[and it just works](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m18s)

[or I I shouldn't say just worked. It](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m21s)

[then goes back to the default. Oh, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m23s)

[want it to save and restore. Oh, got it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m25s)

[That's what you mean by restore. Oh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m29s)

[that's a good question. Hey cutie,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h41m35s)

[from](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h42m49s)

[tweak it,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h42m57s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m02s)

[we come down here,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m04s)

[do](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m10s)

[a check access. You can probably just go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m12s)

[straight invoke because I think it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m14s)

[short circuits if it already has access,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m16s)

[but that's not likely your problem. And](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m18s)

[then filter view short descriptions add](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m21s)

[and puts them all back.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m26s)

[roughly what I was about to tell you to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m39s)

[do.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h43m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m02s)

[it's going to say you may It just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m09s)

[restores the the default sort order.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m11s)

[So, it doesn't maintain whatever sort](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m15s)

[order you had in there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m17s)

[I'm I'm I am wondering a little bit if](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m26s)

[you might need a defer refresh.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m28s)

[on there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m32s)

[So, uh, defer refresh is just a a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m42s)

[disposable on there where you would end](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m45s)

[up wrapping](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m48s)

[uh I just realized I don't invoke it on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m51s)

[a view change. Oh, not invoking it would](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m53s)

[do it as well because you could the you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m56s)

[may end up wanting to do a filter view](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h44m59s)

[block.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m06s)

[That way as you're making all the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m08s)

[changes to it, it's not trying to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m09s)

[refresh on each individual change. It](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m11s)

[just does it once at the very end.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m13s)

[Um, but I wouldn't I I wouldn't expect](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m18s)

[that to make a difference between it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m20s)

[working or not. I would just expect that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m22s)

[to maybe make it smoother and faster](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m24s)

[because um going through and doing the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m26s)

[clear obviously is going to trigger one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m29s)

[set of changes and then every time you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m30s)

[add a sort descriptor, it has to go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m32s)

[through and re-evaluate. But again,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m33s)

[that's what three passes maybe versus](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m36s)

[one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m39s)

[Like it'll probably be more efficient to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m41s)

[do the defer refresh, but I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m43s)

[expect it to change whether it works or](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m45s)

[not.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h45m47s)

[anybody wants to go watch it early, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m13s)

[left a link to it um in my events](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m15s)

[you want to grab it early, you can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m23s)

[certainly go watch it early. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m25s)

[otherwise, it'll go public](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m28s)

[Monday. Uh, let's see. 332.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m33s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m42s)

[let's see. So, I can just do line 332.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m46s)

[Uh, and delete check. Yeah, because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m49s)

[don't think you need the the check](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m52s)

[access. I believe invoke async. I can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m53s)

[double check this. Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h46m56s)

[because check access is actually one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m01s)

[that they try to hide from you.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m03s)

[Uh it's here](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m06s)

[where I think it's actually on these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m10s)

[docks.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m11s)

[One of these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m14s)

[uh access](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m25s)

[whether calling thread has access and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m31s)

[verify access throws an exception. Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m33s)

[where was it? One of these. But yeah, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m36s)

[I believe you can just call in uh invoke](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m38s)

[or invoke async directly on the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m40s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m42s)

[and it will end up shortcircuiting. In](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m44s)

[this case, it's probably better to just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m46s)

[do a straight invoke rather than an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m49s)

[invoke async](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m51s)

[because it'll I imagine it'll be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m57s)

[slightly faster, but I guess it depends](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h47m58s)

[a little bit on the context and where](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m01s)

[this is called.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m02s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m04s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m11s)

[But yeah, let me know if that if that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m16s)

[doesn't get it going, JC, and we can](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m18s)

[pull it down and take a look at it. But](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m19s)

[I think I think it should because in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h48m22s)

[Those errors look out of line and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=01h53m09s)

[This should work,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h02m53s)

[I think.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h02m56s)

[Come on. There you go. Good boy. Good](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h02m58s)

[boy. Come on. You can run. It'll be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m03s)

[okay. I promise a test failure is not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m06s)

[the end of the world. I won't yell at](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m08s)

[you this time if you do it right.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m10s)

[But I may throw things.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m19s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m36s)

[come on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m41s)

[We're working way too hard on this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m42s)

[compilation.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m44s)

[It does look like we've got some](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m48s)

[dependency problems. So, I got to go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m49s)

[resolve.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m51s)

[Okay, so that guy blows up. Great.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m52s)

[That's exciting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m55s)

[Um, let's see. What do we got going down](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h03m57s)

[here?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m00s)

[Unknown type. All of this stuff](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m04s)

[initialized with material design.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m08s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m12s)

[where are you getting](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m15s)

[bundled theme and it's unhappy about it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m24s)

[Well, we got this is a very So, we've](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m34s)

[got past the compilation, but now we've](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m36s)

[got something very very different](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m38s)

[because it's declared there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m44s)

[Well, let's step into this because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m52s)

[don't know where this thing is breaking,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m54s)

[but I can only conclude](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h04m56s)

[that it's got to be the new compiler](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m05s)

[or the new runtime. I guess I I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m08s)

[want to let's not eliminate too many](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m10s)

[choices. So 10.0.2 is already there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m12s)

[Great. Great.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m16s)

[That landed there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m23s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m26s)

[So now we go in, we go in, we go here,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m28s)

[we go here, we go here. And you should](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m32s)

[be what I expect, right? That looks like](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m34s)

[what I would expect to see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m37s)

[for material design application. Great.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m42s)

[I go initialize.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m46s)

[Can I create unknown type?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m49s)

[So app initialized fails to create an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m54s)

[unknown type.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h05m58s)

[What are what is your target framework?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m00s)

[You are net 10 windows.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m04s)

[The thing is I think I have a zaml test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m07s)

[specifically for this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m10s)

[Guess I don't.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m18s)

[Guess](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m22s)

[I don't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m28s)

[because this here is the app initialize](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m30s)

[all the eight and nine tests pass. Of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m34s)

[course they did.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m37s)

[Ayay Microsoft](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m39s)

[that's frustrating.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m42s)

[That is very very frustrating.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m44s)

[So what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m49s)

[what did you change guys? Like how](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m54s)

[is this is I app initialize. So this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h06m59s)

[going to be app test here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m02s)

[Do I have a test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m07s)

[initialize with defaults?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m10s)

[Uh, let's see here. Cuz I do have one of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m13s)

[those, but I do not have one that loads](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m17s)

[up a custom type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m21s)

[initialize with resources. But this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m26s)

[doesn't do a custom type either](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m29s)

[because it's just doing window.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m34s)

[Uh, let's see. We can clean this up for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m37s)

[it to raw string. There we go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m41s)

[make it look a little prettier.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m43s)

[Let's see here. And then this will](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m48s)

[become](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m50s)

[do this. Do that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h07m53s)

[We go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m03s)

[That's just creating a window in a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m05s)

[window with a user control. There's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m08s)

[nothing in here that's referencing an](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m09s)

[external type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m11s)

[because when we go through and do this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m23s)

[call, we pass in a set of assemblies.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m26s)

[Sorry, I shouldn't be yawning. Or](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m33s)

[Mountain Dew.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m34s)

[Nope, that's the wrong one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m44s)

[Of course. When in doubt, you always](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m48s)

[pick the wrong one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m50s)

[Okay, so this guy here comes in, grabs](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m54s)

[the assemblies,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h08m57s)

[puts them in the string, and sends them](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m00s)

[across,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m02s)

[which then goes over to here, which goes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m05s)

[over to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m09s)

[probably going to be in host](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m13s)

[visual service.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m17s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m20s)

[so assemblies to load comes in we](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m27s)

[iterate over them.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m30s)

[If it's not null we call assembly load](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m40s)

[from](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m43s)

[and then we tack it into here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m44s)

[um loaded assemblies](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m49s)

[find all references](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m53s)

[and then this really just comes to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h09m59s)

[I'm making the assumption that current](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m03s)

[domain assembly resolves finds it um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m06s)

[what where is that stack trace](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m12s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m21s)

[I want the stack trace. Show it to me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m23s)

[Show me the stack trace. There you go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m26s)

[The WPF ZAML](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m34s)

[loader.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m37s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m43s)

[I think ZAML reader is probably because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m48s)

[it's the load zaml](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m51s)

[visual tree service](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m55s)

[load zaml. Let's go there first of all.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h10m57s)

[But I I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m02s)

[this guy.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m11s)

[So he comes in here and he makes the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m12s)

[assumption that when he calls this guy,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m15s)

[fact that I've lo called assembly.load](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m19s)

[puts it in memory and then I can use it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m22s)

[because this context I don't believe](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m29s)

[gives me access to any of that stuff.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m31s)

[Uh, obsolete APIs.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m35s)

[Oh no, you're about to ruin my day,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m39s)

[aren't you?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m42s)

[see,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m48s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h11m57s)

[I don't know that any of these are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m12s)

[I don't know that any of these ones are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m22s)

[the ones directly affecting me. Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m24s)

[but you do make a good point and now I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m30s)

[kind of wanting to scan through these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m32s)

[real quick.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m34s)

[That's clearly a break with net 10.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m38s)

[Uh what about WPF?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m42s)

[Uh let's see here. So we've got empty](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m46s)

[and row definitions.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h12m50s)

[That's exciting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h13m02s)

[That is very exciting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h13m14s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h13m17s)

[so don't mix and match your types. Got](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h13m21s)

[this nature](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h14m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h15m58s)

[I am a little curious if this thing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m01s)

[would trigger for me](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m03s)

[because we are making the sweeping](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m10s)

[assumption in all of this code](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m12s)

[we can then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m22s)

[that the assembly resolve fires and that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h16m29s)

[We go. Stop.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m17s)

[Come back.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m20s)

[Red debbug the test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m22s)

[And we're going to try to step into that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m24s)

[and see exactly where that goes.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m26s)

[It's a little difficult because it is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m35s)

[going across to a different process, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m37s)

[we should be attaching to that process](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m41s)

[still.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m43s)

[I guess I should validate that with](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m45s)

[Okay, let's go.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h17m57s)

[Nope, not that one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m01s)

[Nope, not that one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m05s)

[Still not that one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m11s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m24s)

[it is allowing me to](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m28s)

[just catch it there then?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h18m34s)

[No.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h19m58s)

[Did I not put](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m03s)

[I bypass this break point completely.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m08s)

[That's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m20s)

[a very obnoxious issue here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m32s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m36s)

[let me do one more thing. I want to look](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m38s)

[and see when I'm debugging this if I'm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m40s)

[actually getting symbols or if it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m43s)

[doing decompiled sources.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m44s)

[Oh, actually, I should check and confirm](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m48s)

[that it's actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m51s)

[No, it has to be hooking all the way](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m53s)

[across to the other process.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m55s)

[Um because if it wasn't I wouldn't be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h20m58s)

[getting into ZAML reader. Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m00s)

[debug Windows](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m04s)

[uh modules and then](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m07s)

[ZAML test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m11s)

[symbol loading disabled](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m14s)

[by include exclude setting. What load?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m17s)

[Okay. I don't know what include exclude](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m26s)

[setting it was doing](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m29s)

[symbol settings](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m33s)

[there. Okay,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m49s)

[that's fine. Now we're going to F5 this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m52s)

[again.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m54s)

[Okay, now at least we're hitting our](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m57s)

[break points over here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h21m58s)

[So the assumption now is that I should](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m02s)

[hit this break point](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m04s)

[right after this one. So somewhere](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m06s)

[between here and here, I should get this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m09s)

[call back. Okay, so we are getting this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m12s)

[call. Loaded assemblies. We've got those](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m15s)

[ones there. Great. That's kind of what](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m18s)

[we expect.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m21s)

[Um, and we are looking for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m22s)

[system runtime 10.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m28s)

[Uh, shouldn't be one of ours.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m31s)

[So, next](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m41s)

[kind of expect this to hit a handful of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m45s)

[times. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m47s)

[okay, that's just system runtime. System](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m50s)

[runtime. System runtime.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h22m53s)

[So, it never once asked for anything](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m06s)

[other than system runtime, at least in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m08s)

[the current domain assembly resolve.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m11s)

[Why is that the case?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m19s)

[ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m23s)

[Oh, I guess in this version of ZAML](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m26s)

[test, it's not running net 10, is it?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m29s)

[because this is running the version of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m36s)

[ZAML test that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m39s)

[launches](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m41s)

[as a net 9 which is probably why it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m43s)

[doesn't have the net. Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m46s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m52s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m54s)

[I need to update the Nougat package](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h23m58s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m03s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m06s)

[just do this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m10s)

[This is a bug before. Ln](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m12s)

[um, I need ZAML test to be on its latest](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m23s)

[preview, which was the one we literally](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m28s)

[posted earlier tonight.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m31s)

[So, I need the version number to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m35s)

[131ci 660 because I need the net 10](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m37s)

[version be able to use it in a net 10](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m42s)

[project](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m46s)

[because then it shouldn't ask for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m48s)

[the 10 runtime because it's already](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m51s)

[running as a net 10 app.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m53s)

[Okay, that that probably makes me feel](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m57s)

[warm and fuzzy again.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h24m59s)

[rebuild the test project and then let](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m03s)

[we'll we'll try this one more time](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m05s)

[because I'm guessing the rough number of](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m10s)

[errors was I don't know around 10,000 or](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m12s)

[a,080](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m16s)

[give or take.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m18s)

[That's my theory.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m20s)

[Delegation of task. I love the screen](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m24s)

[name by the way. I'm hoping that's a net](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m27s)

[joke because it's really funny if it is.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m30s)

[Welcome to the stream.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m33s)

[Uh, come on. Compile. You can do it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m36s)

[You can do it. Go a little one.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m40s)

[Okay. Uh, detected package downgrade.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m46s)

[Um, what's what's is it complaining](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m51s)

[about? Daml test want system command](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m54s)

[line 202. This thing does not have 202.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h25m57s)

[Okay, fine. We can do that. Um, system](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m00s)

[command line 202, which for people who](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m04s)

[haven't seen it, system command line did](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m07s)

[go GA. So,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m09s)

[love it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m13s)

[Okay, so now rebuild again. Come on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m16s)

[Just want to see all the test pass. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m21s)

[want to see all the test pass.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m24s)

[Yeah, because we only run the UI test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m33s)

[against a single framework because it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m35s)

[kind of pointless to run it against](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m37s)

[multiple.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m39s)

[Like I've not once had a UI test that if](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m40s)

[I had run it against all the frameworks](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m43s)

[would have caught a bug.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m45s)

[So I just don't because they're slow and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m49s)

[that would take a lot of extra time.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m51s)

[I'm sure at some point like it does it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m57s)

[does technically leave a blind spot, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h26m59s)

[it's not a blind spot that realistically](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m01s)

[bites me at all.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m04s)

[Okay, so](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m07s)

[this is now system command line changes.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m09s)

[So we can do this. This I've now done a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m13s)

[handful of times. So this this one won't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m16s)

[bother me too much. Um let's see. So get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m18s)

[default value is not in the constructor](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m22s)

[anymore and it's called default value](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m24s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m27s)

[and it looks like that. So that goes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m29s)

[like that. That goes like that and I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m32s)

[think description is out of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m34s)

[Yeah, I think description is no longer](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m38s)

[in the constructor either. So it moves](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m40s)

[down.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m43s)

[Not a big deal.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m46s)

[They go like that and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m49s)

[name aliases. So we actually don't even](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m51s)

[need to do that. We can just do that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m54s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h27m59s)

[So that makes life a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m01s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m03s)

[A little bit cleaner there. There.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m04s)

[There.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m06s)

[That. Do that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m08s)

[Okay. And then this is default value](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m11s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m13s)

[goes like that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m15s)

[the description on top I think](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m18s)

[for reasons](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m22s)

[get rid of the PNS there](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m26s)

[comes a comma that goes away](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m30s)

[uh let's see this needs to be like that](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m33s)

[like that great great great](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m37s)

[that goes like that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m47s)

[Stop it. I helping me. Um, okay. There](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h28m49s)

[def. Oh, you're right. Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m05s)

[alphabetically.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m08s)

[My my default thing was like, "No,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m14s)

[description is more important." But](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m16s)

[yeah, you're right. Alphabetically, I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m18s)

[should probably do it that way. Uh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m19s)

[we'll say, JC, you have an absolutely](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m26s)

[amazing eagle eye for all of my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m29s)

[mistakes. I believe this just get value](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m30s)

[now.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m33s)

[Goes like that. And then I just need the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m36s)

[comma there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m38s)

[Don't technically need one there. So](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m40s)

[we'll just clean them all off](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m42s)

[there. And we got that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m44s)

[Don't need the using statement anymore.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m47s)

[We're off to the races. Yeah. So anybody](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m49s)

[who's following system command lines](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m52s)

[adventure to GA, they they ended up kind](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m54s)

[of going back from some of the breaking](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m56s)

[changes that got put in.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h29m59s)

[So there was initially when there was a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m01s)

[big push to try to get it as part of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m03s)

[BCL they there was a huge debate about](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m05s)

[what should things be named options](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m08s)

[really generic that could cause](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m10s)

[confusion and this that and the other](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m12s)

[and so eventually they um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m15s)

[they they just rolled it back and said](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m19s)

[you know what we're going to just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m21s)

[release the Nougat package it won't make](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m23s)

[it into the BCL. Uh the only reason it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m24s)

[squawking here is because this doesn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m27s)

[match the folder structure. Um there's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m29s)

[just not a we this file here we file](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m32s)

[link into both projects](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m35s)

[um on the demo apps. So it's unhappy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m38s)

[that this namespace doesn't match. But](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m41s)

[that namespace is intentionally done](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m43s)

[that way because it's used in two](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m45s)

[different projects just to make it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m47s)

[obvious that that's what's going on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m48s)

[So it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m51s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h30m58s)

[Little concerned that this thing didn't](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m00s)

[get generated from](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m02s)

[my source generator.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m04s)

[What is your problem here? Oh, blue wolf](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m09s)

[icons. Okay. Yeah, I understand. At some](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m12s)

[point, I'm going to probably go roll](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m15s)

[my own version of that library that's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m18s)

[updated to modern.net. net because I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m20s)

[will say copilot is actually fairly good](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m23s)

[if you fork a library and want to just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m25s)

[bring something up to modern.net to just](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m28s)

[turn it loose and say make it modern for](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m29s)

[me.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m32s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m33s)

[like I see these errors but the the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m36s)

[problem with these errors is these are](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m38s)

[errors of things that should be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m40s)

[get selected item](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m44s)

[like these should be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m47s)

[Wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h31m54s)

[Visual element of T](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m03s)

[where T is a selector. That is correct.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m09s)

[Uh let's see. Auto suggest box cannot be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m17s)

[used as um](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m20s)

[are you not derived from selector?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m27s)

[Oh, look at that.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m34s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m36s)

[do we have](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m39s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m43s)

[because autosuggest box itself has](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m49s)

[a dependency property for selected item.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m54s)

[Oh, that's interesting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h32m59s)

[Yeah. So it's Oh, so it's actually](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m02s)

[landing on the wrong extension method](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m04s)

[because of this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m08s)

[So this actually needs to be the static](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m11s)

[call. So this is going to be auto](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m14s)

[um this box extensions.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m17s)

[this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m23s)

[um demo test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m26s)

[What is the the generated ones?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m30s)

[I don't see it generating out the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m37s)

[extensions,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m39s)

[but I would have expected to see auto](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m42s)

[suggest box here because that is this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m44s)

[guy should absolutely have a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m48s)

[um attribute.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m54s)

[And where did I put them? Did I put them](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m56s)

[all at the top?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h33m58s)

[Yeah, generate helpers.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m02s)

[So, this guy should be triggering on](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m05s)

[generate helpers and auto suggest box.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m08s)

[So, what did](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m13s)

[the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m15s)

[ZAML test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m17s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m22s)

[so I have broken on my publish. I have.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m24s)

[Oh, wait. No, I'm looking at the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m30s)

[packages. It's not analyzer. Hang on.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m31s)

[Okay. Same problem, though. I do not](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m36s)

[have the analyzer being packaged](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m39s)

[properly anymore.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m42s)

[So, it did not generate the extensions](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m45s)

[needed for this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m48s)

[That's annoying.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m52s)

[Um, we're going to we're going to put](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m55s)

[this in here real quick before I get](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m57s)

[carried away. But the issue is when I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h34m58s)

[package this guy up,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m02s)

[bet if I go out and look at nougat.org,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m04s)

[it becomes real bloody obvious what I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m07s)

[did wrong. Okay, we'll test.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m09s)

[Right. So, if I go here and I grab this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m13s)

[version and this version and I go open](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m16s)

[in package explorer and I go open in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m19s)

[package explorer and I close and close,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m22s)

[we go load.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m25s)

[So, you'll note 13 which is the old one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m28s)

[has this nice analyzers and net and C](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m31s)

[and the ZAML test generator. And this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m34s)

[one there's no analyzer package.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m36s)

[That is a problem. That is absolutely a](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m40s)

[problem. And it also doesn't have the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m44s)

[build stuff in it either. What the heck?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m45s)

[How did I botch so much of this?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m47s)

[So, the new Nougat package is completely](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m51s)

[dorked up and only has the lib stuff in](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m55s)

[it and not everything else.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h35m58s)

[And that will absolutely bite the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m05s)

[material design library because now it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m07s)

[not generating the extension methods](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m10s)

[that are needed for this.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m13s)

[And I wonder if I'm going to have a type](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m17s)

[conflict now that I'm generating more.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m19s)

[I might not.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m22s)

[Might not. At least not for that one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m25s)

[case.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m26s)

[So the question really becomes if I go](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m28s)

[back and look at ZAML test,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m32s)

[right? Because this guy merged.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m36s)

[What did I what did I stage?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m39s)

[Uh stash for a moment, right? So this is](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m42s)

[the commit that did it.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m46s)

[So what did I do wrong to break my](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m50s)

[packaging?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m54s)

[Was](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h36m56s)

[it?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m00s)

[I didn't change it there. I wonder how](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m04s)

[many releases back it broke because it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m08s)

[may not have been my latest one. I](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m10s)

[wonder if it was broken here, too.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m13s)

[Look at Let's look at this one](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m16s)

[because this is 650. So 650 it was fine.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m22s)

[It's only in the latest one where it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m27s)

[broken.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m29s)

[660 it's broken. 650 it's fine.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m30s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m40s)

[So why did that?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m42s)

[So what changed?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m50s)

[What changed inside of each of these](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h37m55s)

[this project here?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m01s)

[I mean is packable is false](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m05s)

[which makes sense.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m09s)

[because I don't want it to pack up as](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m16s)

[its own nougat package. I want it to be](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m18s)

[I want it to be a dependent library, but](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m25s)

[I don't have anything in here that how](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m28s)

[was I packaging it before?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m31s)

[Um, that's the test. That's a unit test](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m38s)

[generator.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m40s)

[How was I?](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m42s)

[Oh, like all of this stuff that got](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m45s)

[deleted. Dang, Nabbit, co-pilot, you](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m47s)

[freaking](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m49s)

[And that's the Nougat package. That's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m57s)

[how it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h38m59s)

[co-pilot,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m01s)

[I'm gonna punch you so hard.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m02s)

[you. I completely missed that change and](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m07s)

[it completely hosed me. You bloody](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m11s)

[idiot.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m14s)

[Okay, you think that's part of the](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m16s)

[problem? Maybe like the fact that it's](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m19s)

[not including any of these things. Okay,](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m20s)

[that fixes that. We don't need this](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m23s)

[anymore. This goes away. We can go back](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m25s)

[to our directory build props and put](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m27s)

[this back as lowercase icon PNG because](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m29s)

[that's what it actually is when we copy](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m32s)

[the sucker in because we've lowercased](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m35s)

[it there. Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m37s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m40s)

[There's something in here that made it](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m44s)

[think that that was necessary.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m46s)

[Like is there a a hard-coded net 9 or](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m49s)

[something? No, because we use](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m52s)

[configuration in there.](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m53s)

[So short version](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h39m59s)

[uh I'm an idiot](https://youtu.be/pz71s2f9X-U?t=02h40m01s)
