[number releases are what they call their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h01m43s)

[consideration it usually means hey we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m49s)

[looking into what it would take to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m51s)

[implement this you know not not fully](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m53s)

[committing because some things are a lot](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m55s)

[harder than others but we're at least](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m57s)

[looking into what a what a solution](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h03m58s)

[might be which is kind of cool so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m01s)

[especially seeing these two things kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m02s)

[of bubble all the way up to the top is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m04s)

[tree support we will we will go through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m12s)

[here the other cool thing in this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m14s)

[Launchpad views being able to actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m16s)

[save customized views so I've shown off](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m18s)

[the Launchpad before I love it for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m21s)

[looking at all my issues but being able](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m24s)

[to kind of save some queries especially](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m25s)

[around like hey there's this particular](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m27s)

[particular set of people that I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m29s)

[interested in following because you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m30s)

[maybe my team just dumps all developers](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m32s)

[into one big team it's like well that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m34s)

[may be the team in terms of like the the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m37s)

[git providers view of the world but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m40s)

[functionally the people I deal with on a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m42s)

[day-to-day basis is you know these four](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m44s)

[these four people right so you might](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m46s)

[have something of that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m48s)

[nature um and then all of these ones](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m50s)

[down here and then one that may not be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m52s)

[obvious many people but excites me very](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m54s)

[very much this one right here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h04m57s)

[I do a lot of net stuff a lot of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m00s)

[Microsoft tech I work in devops uh and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m02s)

[GitHub primarily as my git providers uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m05s)

[and this one annoyed me to no end the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m08s)

[number of people I had to help when](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m11s)

[their uh token expired and it would](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m12s)

[prompt them for your username and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m15s)

[password was really in so this one makes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m17s)

[me happy I realize I I get excited about](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m21s)

[the little things okay so get work trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m23s)

[for those people unfamiliar with it a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m27s)

[work tree uh and there's the there's the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m30s)

[git docks this is something that git](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m33s)

[Kraken has kind of supported for a while](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m35s)

[uh it it at least didn't crash or do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m39s)

[anything wacky when you when you created](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m41s)

[work trees but to leverage work trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m43s)

[you often had to drop into the terminal](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m45s)

[be able to actually do anything useful](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m47s)

[the big idea here is imagine the cases](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m49s)

[where I've seen people who they clone](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m52s)

[their repository twice simply because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m54s)

[they want to have two directories uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h05m57s)

[usually pointed at two different spots](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m00s)

[so that they can like compare and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m02s)

[contrast like I've seen often times](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m03s)

[people will keep a uh clone of their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m05s)

[repository just sitting on Main uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m08s)

[because it's like well I want to test my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m10s)

[latest stuff like I want to know has the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m12s)

[stuff I've been working on is that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m14s)

[different than what's like been released](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m16s)

[or something similar to that and that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m18s)

[a at least a fairly common thing that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m20s)

[I've seen people do but the problem is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m22s)

[is if you clone the repository twice](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m24s)

[you've effectively doubled the size of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m26s)

[uh your repo on disk uh all just so that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m30s)

[you can have the same stuff in two](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m33s)

[different folders what a work tree does](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m35s)

[is it allows you to have uh two separate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m38s)

[directories of your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m41s)

[repository checked out and because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m44s)

[they're two separate directories you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m47s)

[open them up in your IDE you can treat](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m48s)

[them like you would any other repository](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m50s)

[but you don't have two separate dogit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m53s)

[direct so you don't take the same hit as](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m55s)

[far as having the entire uh get database](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h06m58s)

[in multiple places you only have that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m00s)

[once but now you can have all of these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m03s)

[work trees being able to spread apart](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m05s)

[they're also really powerful for doing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m07s)

[things like code reviews on poll](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m09s)

[requests because now rather than messing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m11s)

[up your your current Branch or your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m14s)

[working directory where you're currently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m16s)

[at you can go ahead and just open up a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m18s)

[PO request point that Branch into a work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m20s)

[tree and now you've got a directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m23s)

[where you can play with things you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m25s)

[compare and contrast back to you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m27s)

[maybe main or the branch that you're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m29s)

[working on uh it's much easier to kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m31s)

[of go back and forth with this this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m33s)

[the support that we've been given this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m35s)

[is this is the awesomeness um when you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m37s)

[crack did kind of explaining work trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h07m59s)

[and walking through it so if you are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m01s)

[the only thing they don't let you hide](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m38s)

[is the local because you you kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m40s)

[need to be able to see your your local](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m41s)

[stuff otherwise what are you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m43s)

[doing ah Mountain Dew I have not had](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m47s)

[enough of you today okay but you can see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m50s)

[here I've got things like GitHub issues](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m54s)

[teams sub modules GitHub actions and you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m56s)

[can customize this for repository just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h08m59s)

[however you like depending on what what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m02s)

[is actually interesting uh to you but if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m04s)

[we go and open up work trees and let me](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m07s)

[flip over to the material](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m09s)

[design right you can see uh I've got one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m12s)

[work tree here that it apparently is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m16s)

[created just from the fact that I that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m18s)

[this is the branch that I started on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m20s)

[right and I can flip back to master and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m22s)

[this is where my work tree is currently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m26s)

[sitting and it's tracking this current](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m28s)

[Branch now I've got a couple ways that I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m30s)

[can go through and handle things you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m32s)

[create a new work tree with this little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m36s)

[little plus button right here right so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m38s)

[the the plus button only shows up once](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m40s)

[you hover around this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m42s)

[title um and you get this the other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m43s)

[option that you can do is you can come](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m47s)

[over to these uh branches right and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m48s)

[where is create work tree from Branch so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m53s)

[especially for po request ones and I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m56s)

[believe let me check](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m58s)

[do it from the PLL request screen too](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h09m59s)

[check uh let's see all poll](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m02s)

[requests uh is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m07s)

[not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m11s)

[disappointing pointing I'm G have to I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m13s)

[gonna have to add that to the the list](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m16s)

[of requests this is this is both the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m18s)

[best and worst thing right is get Kraken](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m19s)

[is great at implementing stuff but every](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m22s)

[time they Implement stuff I then want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m24s)

[more more I want it down I want the I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m26s)

[want the same op option down here right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m28s)

[because I can I can do this but it' be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m30s)

[really slick if I could rightclick and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m32s)

[immediately jump to a work tree rather](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m36s)

[than having to go from](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m37s)

[the right so I mean in theory if we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m40s)

[could just jump to the branch uh go to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m43s)

[the branch in graph right so I can go to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m46s)

[the branch in the graph rightclick and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m48s)

[then I can uh create work tree from it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m51s)

[so that that is an option right um that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m54s)

[gives us a little bit uh easier access](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h10m58s)

[to it so something something of that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m03s)

[nature going through there so let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m06s)

[let's take a look so if we come here uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m08s)

[flipper commented out so let's let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m10s)

[imagine we wanted to go here and I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m13s)

[even know if there's a PR for this there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m17s)

[a PR for this can't tell the uh scroll](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m20s)

[view normally be near the top if it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m23s)

[got a new one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m25s)

[look like there's even a PR for this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m29s)

[tell one there's an actual PR for this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m31s)

[uh scroll VI ignore pad and template so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m34s)

[go to this in graph there's that and if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m36s)

[we right click on this guy we can create](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m39s)

[work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m41s)

[tree right so you can see down here I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m42s)

[have my uh working directory where my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m46s)

[repository is checked out is right here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m48s)

[right so it's tacking on work trees on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m52s)

[the end here right so we get the work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m55s)

[trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h11m58s)

[and then it's just defaulting to the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m00s)

[branch name and then work tree branch to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m02s)

[create right so we've got our source](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m05s)

[Branch to create and then a local](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m08s)

[directory because you can't have your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m10s)

[work tree checked out in the same](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m11s)

[repository where your code is again they](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m13s)

[idea is you've got two directories each](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m15s)

[with a copy of the code but typically](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m18s)

[pointed at two different places right so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m21s)

[we go through here and we can go okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m24s)

[sounds great make me a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m25s)

[worke open now](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m27s)

[open open open open okay and then I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m31s)

[going to point out one more thing that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m34s)

[rather important this little guy right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m36s)

[here we are in a work tree that is that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m37s)

[is somewhat important to note and the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m41s)

[other thing is if I go file uh open and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m44s)

[file](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m47s)

[manager then we come over here right we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m48s)

[can see that this guy oh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m50s)

[that's I expected it to open me](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m52s)

[different spot right um we can see where](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m56s)

[this guy should have opened me is in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h12m59s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m03s)

[place which I'm going to have a I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m04s)

[going be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m07s)

[great don't worry get crack is good at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m09s)

[fixing stuff place it was supposed to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m11s)

[so this is the main repository here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m14s)

[right go back here and I go work trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m16s)

[and here is where we should have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m21s)

[been right this guy here is now checked](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m24s)

[out and again you'll note the the key](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m27s)

[thing that that's missing from this the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m28s)

[dotg directory right I'm I'm checked out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m31s)

[I've got the full code I've got the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m35s)

[solution we can fire this guy up and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m36s)

[look at it you can see there's this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m38s)

[saying okay here's where the main](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m55s)

[repository is checked out the dogit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m57s)

[folder is where the git database uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h13m59s)

[stuff lives and then there's the work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m02s)

[tree and all the information so any git](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m03s)

[cap um for people who who are interested](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m21s)

[in learning more about git I cannot](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m25s)

[recommend this course enough it is is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m27s)

[classes we teach at University we make](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m42s)

[sure this is covered because it is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m44s)

[absolutely critical that people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m46s)

[understand Source control do not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h14m48s)

[here now we can fire this sucker up and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m09s)

[proof is in the pudding this thing will](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m12s)

[work the the thing to note if you have a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m14s)

[repository with like a long build time](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m17s)

[or like multiple steps for building this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m20s)

[can be kind of obnoxious right because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m23s)

[when you make a work tree this is like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m25s)

[fresh clo at this point because normally](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h15m28s)

[scroll view ignore padding and template](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h16m36s)

[one new](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h16m40s)

[code let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h16m44s)

[see so this is a new attached property](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h16m46s)

[and I think I remember seeing some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h16m50s)

[request changes and let me know okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m08s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m20s)

[yeah so the only thing that I think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m22s)

[might be a little off this is actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m25s)

[actually forward it down um well let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m41s)

[let's continue here right like we can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m44s)

[now that we've got this let's pick on uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m46s)

[do click on list box and let let's let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m55s)

[see about](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h17m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m16s)

[so uh let's see themes list box it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m18s)

[around](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m21s)

[let's come here six boom right so I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m29s)

[think the actual intent](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m33s)

[here I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m36s)

[not let's go check the list](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m38s)

[boxes wow I got to turn off caps](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m42s)

[lock trying to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m48s)

[decide is this is this is being passed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m51s)

[down but attached properties don't do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m54s)

[anything without extra](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h18m57s)

[stuff uh let's see scroll viewer ignore](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m01s)

[padding let's see does this uh does this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m04s)

[guy do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m07s)

[anything doesn't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m08s)

[register oh we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m11s)

[need make it match the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m13s)

[others I actually do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m20s)

[look somebody's got to be read reading](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m26s)

[this property there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m29s)

[assignments uh scroll viewer so it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m31s)

[used here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m33s)

[so so if scroll viewer ignore padding is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m36s)

[false and padding mode is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m40s)

[default then we do uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m43s)

[setting of the margin forward in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m47s)

[padding it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m51s)

[look okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m54s)

[Merry Christmas what happened to Monday](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h19m59s)

[Wednesday if I did that was a very big](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m20s)

[mistake on my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m22s)

[part um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m24s)

[okay so this guy really just forwards](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m31s)

[down padding when padding](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m33s)

[mode adding mode](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m38s)

[added what are the values here fault and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m41s)

[content I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m47s)

[confused when when each of these get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m50s)

[applied so false and default false and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m53s)

[content so you have to set it to false](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m56s)

[but it defaults to true I'm not actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h20m59s)

[sure that this changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m02s)

[anything oh it's Thursday for me already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m05s)

[only seems like yesterday you were](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m08s)

[streaming I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m09s)

[sorry it's a good thing you were late](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m11s)

[because I was late today too Izzy so it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m13s)

[works it it all works out it all works](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m15s)

[out um this is actually not going to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m18s)

[anything and the reason I say it's not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m22s)

[going to do anything because this thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m28s)

[the the default value for ignore padding](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m32s)

[is true so the in the new property](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m34s)

[metadata here right so that guy there if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m37s)

[the default value is true that is the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m41s)

[same as not being applied so that's not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m44s)

[actually going to make much of a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m47s)

[difference the the key thing here though](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m49s)

[let me look back at the original issue](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m56s)

[Tree View](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h21m59s)

[uh yeah so somebody was trying to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m03s)

[manipulate the scroll viewer that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m05s)

[inside of the tree view with these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m07s)

[attached](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m08s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m09s)

[um and none of them propagate through so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m12s)

[I think the the key change here that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m16s)

[really needs to happen right so it's not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m17s)

[uh just direct assign to True here that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m22s)

[we're looking for what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m23s)

[is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m26s)

[binding uh relative](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m27s)

[Source relative Source big head on the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m30s)

[other side uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m32s)

[see templated](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m35s)

[arant right and then The Binding path](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m39s)

[here is going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m42s)

[be uh let's see WPF](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m45s)

[colon roll](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m49s)

[viewer uh ignore padding so I think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m52s)

[though we don't want to just forward](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m55s)

[down one I think we want to for down](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m56s)

[too system runtime oh that's because we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h22m59s)

[were debugging okay and I think what we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m02s)

[want here also](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m05s)

[is uh wasn't there a Content](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m07s)

[mode padding](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m12s)

[mode](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m14s)

[right padding mode also should probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m16s)

[be propagated down because I think what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m18s)

[we would like to do is actually send](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m21s)

[this from top down now I'm curious](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m23s)

[though padding mode defaults to content](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m26s)

[but ignore padding is true so unless you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m29s)

[set ignore padding](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m31s)

[to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m33s)

[um uh false it's not going to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m36s)

[anything we're going to just do this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m41s)

[we're going to do this do this do this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m44s)

[do this um I think this is the actual](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m45s)

[change that we want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m48s)

[and see here uh no game bar no uh how do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m50s)

[I make you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h23m57s)

[stop](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m00s)

[uh I want you to not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m02s)

[exist how do I make you go away capture](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m05s)

[go away audio go away go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m08s)

[away I just do that okay okay do not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m13s)

[press Windows](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m16s)

[keyg the problem is I use Windows key uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m19s)

[copy paste for the multi clipboard and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m24s)

[that occasionally fites me okay so there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m27s)

[was that line we're not going to fix the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m30s)

[whole thing we'll just do the one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m31s)

[00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,080](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m33s)

G6

[48 um there's the other scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m38s)

[and once again we just want to forward](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m41s)

[those properties through so for those](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m43s)

[people who haven't seen it this is this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m45s)

[is effectively what ends up happening](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m47s)

[the other way that this can be made to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m49s)

[quote unquote work so just to clarify](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m51s)

[the the fundamental issue here is if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m55s)

[someone](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m58s)

[sets uh one of these attached properties](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h24m59s)

[up on the list box](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m02s)

[itself those properties just get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m05s)

[assigned to the list box they don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m07s)

[propagate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m09s)

[down the way that they typically would](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m10s)

[propagate down is by adding appropriate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m12s)

[bindings and saying oh okay if it's set](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m15s)

[on the list box which is the templated](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m17s)

[parent right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m20s)

[here whatever whatever the the padding](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m22s)

[mode and ignore padding are on on our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m25s)

[list box go ahead and assign them into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m27s)

[this particular scroll viewer right that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m30s)

[forwards them down the other way this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m32s)

[can technically be achieved is you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m35s)

[set uh the property up itself to uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m38s)

[recurse all the way down the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m44s)

[disadvantage there is it's um less](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m46s)

[efficient if you're if you have to say](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m49s)

[hey this attached property propagates](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m52s)

[all the way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m54s)

[down uh let's see FY I fixed the snack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m56s)

[bar styling thing I had turns out out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h25m59s)

[Bar turns out binds can't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m05s)

[do uh casting like that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m07s)

[yep that is correct that is correct but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m11s)

[all good Izzy all good I I I do wacky](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m16s)

[stuff all the time oh and I've got a got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m20s)

[a C problem too that we may look at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m23s)

[while](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m25s)

[we're while while we're going I had a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m26s)

[colleague show me some interesting C](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m28s)

[code with generics asking me how how or](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m31s)

[how and why it worked the way that it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m35s)

[did and I looked down at it and I went I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m36s)

[have no idea and it's unusual for me to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m38s)

[do that and so I was like send me a copy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m41s)

[of that I want to dig into that deeper](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m44s)

[because I don't understand it yet](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m45s)

[because I have a I have a c compiler](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m48s)

[that lives in my head and it always](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m50s)

[bothers me when the compiler in my head](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m52s)

[doesn't match the compiler on the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m54s)

[computer](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m55s)

[so there's that okay so we're g to I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h26m58s)

[think suggest some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m04s)

[changes just two changes so we've got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m06s)

[this here so this is the code suggestion](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m09s)

[here and let's just double check our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m12s)

[changes um okay that just expression](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m15s)

[bodies up all the members and then shows](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m19s)

[think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m29s)

[uh is that something you can show on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m31s)

[think we uh I I had him send me a copy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m45s)

[of it and we can we can recreate it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m48s)

[because my intent was to like I don't I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m52s)

[don't have the original code anyway](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m54s)

[because it was on a a client repository](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m56s)

[that I don't have access to but I had](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h27m59s)

[him send me uh enough of a description](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m01s)

[of what the setup looks like that I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m04s)

[think we can recreate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m05s)

[it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m08s)

[uh the is if you got really good](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m11s)

[examples I add them to my calamities](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m13s)

[list don't I don't know if I showed this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m15s)

[recently so the I started in on my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m17s)

[calamities thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m20s)

[again and I need to I need to add some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m22s)

[stuff to it so I've I've got ideas](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m26s)

[sitting in here for more fun things to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m29s)

[add into this calamities repository so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m31s)

[people have other suggestions of more](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m35s)

[horrible horrible horrible things you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m37s)

[can do with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m38s)

[c](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m42s)

[yeah there's there's there's some funky](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m44s)

[stuff um which](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m48s)

[gets gets really really really](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m50s)

[entertaining](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m54s)

[so I have I have bad ideas the the one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h28m56s)

[that I want to add to it is the new uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m00s)

[attribute for declaring overload](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m02s)

[net User Group](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m10s)

[talk uh let's see I think what we want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m12s)

[to do instead is to uh forward the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m15s)

[value attached property rather than](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m22s)

[always that it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m27s)

[through uh which is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m30s)

[Vault](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m34s)

[um here is a sample](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m36s)

[showing uh updating it on the this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m40s)

[box stage these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m45s)

[changes and then we're going to suggest](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m48s)

[file](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m50s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m52s)

[and I think if I remember right that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m53s)

[puts a comment out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h29m57s)

[on yeah it does](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m01s)

[this yeah we could have proven run but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m08s)

[there's that so okay anyway R](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m10s)

[trees yeah feels like going through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m14s)

[trading](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m16s)

[cards uh yep I can understand that so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m18s)

[but you you probably missed this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m23s)

[Izzy work trees and get Kraken now we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m25s)

[exist they are a thing uh and they do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m28s)

[show up and I've found two teeny whey](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m31s)

[little bugs here that already bothered](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m34s)

[me but you know that's that's a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m35s)

[different story but the key thing here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m37s)

[is I've got two separate work trees that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m39s)

[I'm now working with the other thing I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m42s)

[wanted to look at is there was a pretty](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m44s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m48s)

[article a colleague of mine](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m49s)

[shared it's this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m52s)

[here and so this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m56s)

[uh I'm not familiar with this author uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h30m58s)

[Matt I assume um and the description](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m02s)

[here was how they prefer to use work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m05s)

[trees right uh so the work tree flow](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m08s)

[that I just showed with PR review of hey](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m12s)

[look we can now open the pr in a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m14s)

[separate folder we don't have to mess up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m16s)

[our own stuff or or clutter things um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m18s)

[and then we can just throw them away](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m21s)

[that's kind of cool right that that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m22s)

[makes me happy this one here is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m25s)

[slightly different approach of how to go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m28s)

[through and do it and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m31s)

[specifically um in this blog that um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m33s)

[they outline a few different ways that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m37s)

[they go through and use work trees](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m39s)

[so rather than Breaking Up by like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m43s)

[Branch it's per concurrent activity so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m45s)

[they've identified the five things that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m50s)

[they might be doing concurrently On Any](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m52s)

[Given repo and then they promptly go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m54s)

[through and make separate work trees for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h31m58s)

[each so specifically calling](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m01s)

[out right so main is for looking at the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m04s)

[the pristine code effectively you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m08s)

[what's been released what's out there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m09s)

[for you know sanity check yourself uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m11s)

[work for whatever they're currently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m15s)

[working on great fine uh review for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m17s)

[doing code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m20s)

[reviews Buzz which is an interesting one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m21s)

[um effectively running uh it's sounded](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m25s)

[like fuzz](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m28s)

[testing where uh you use some sort of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m29s)

[fuzzing tool to try to introduce uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m32s)

[differences in your code to try to catch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m35s)

[bugs uh and then scratch for everything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m37s)

[else of I just need a temp directory to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m40s)

[go through and play](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m42s)

[with and this isn't this isn't bad I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m44s)

[don't think I would go through and do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m47s)

[this making five workspaces for every](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m49s)

[single repo I work in I work in way too](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m51s)

[many rep I think for a mono repo setup](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m53s)

[this probably works great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m56s)

[I think for a poly repo setup this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h32m58s)

[probably way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m00s)

[Overkill massive Overkill but the that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m02s)

[that's another nice thing about having](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m06s)

[uh work trees is it does give you a a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m08s)

[way of kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m11s)

[having checked out stuff uh exist like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m12s)

[if you've got a a backend thing that you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m17s)

[need to have up and running uh for like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m19s)

[local work but then you know oh well I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m22s)

[need to go check this Branch out well](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m25s)

[you don't have to kill your back and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m26s)

[running you can do a work tree to jump](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m28s)

[over to it so this was interesting and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m29s)

[this was a pattern that one of my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m32s)

[colleagues was trying to set up and ran](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m34s)

[into issues doing so and so I wanted to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m37s)

[see if we could actually set it up as](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m39s)

[well if I go back to my Masterwork treat](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m41s)

[and then what do lock work treat lock](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m44s)

[message no](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m47s)

[touchy that seems appropriate submit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m50s)

[oh remove this work tree unlock this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m56s)

[work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h33m59s)

[tree if it's locked can I remove](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m00s)

[it oh wait is is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m04s)

[lock at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m08s)

[that I didn't I I've never even used](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m10s)

[locked on the command](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m13s)

[line oh okay prevents it from being](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m18s)

[pruned](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m22s)

[automatically and interesting it also](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m26s)

[prevents it from being moved or](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m29s)

[deleted okay that's that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m31s)

[useful I don't know that I would care](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m36s)

[that much but okay great cool day](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m39s)

[exposed it uh yeah Force remove we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m43s)

[going to it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m46s)

[oh hang on I'll move myself out of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m49s)

[way failed to delete invalid argument](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m52s)

[hold on I have a sinking suspicion](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m55s)

[often times when get Kraken has errs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h34m59s)

[like this it's usually an artifact of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m01s)

[file locks and I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m04s)

[Visual Studio had that file lock now the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m05s)

[interesting part though is did it clean](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m08s)

[up after itself or did it leave it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m10s)

[sitting there oh it left it sitting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m11s)

[there so it torched the work tree okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m13s)

[have to go back through this more bugs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m16s)

[more bugs more](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m19s)

[bugs okay so let's see if we can set](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m20s)

[up I kind of want to see if I can set up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m27s)

[blogs setup only in work trees uh for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m28s)

[what we're doing Kracken question](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m33s)

[fireway is he I've got lots of cracking](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m35s)

[thoughts okay so if I wanted to go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m43s)

[through and do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m46s)

[this uh reference to check out so we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m47s)

[going to go through and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m50s)

[do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m52s)

[this uh Branch to create and cannot](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m54s)

[create a work tree because work tree](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m57s)

[with the same Branch name already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h35m59s)

[exists](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m01s)

[so I want to I want to check and see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m08s)

[where the where this where this got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m10s)

[to let's see have you ever seen issues](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m22s)

[when pushing tags that it fails do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m24s)

[something something in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m27s)

[hooks oh interesting okay so you've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m29s)

[got local get so I I just to clarify are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m34s)

[these just standard](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m38s)

[um GI hooks I've deleted them but they](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m42s)

[keep being](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m46s)

[recreated oh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m48s)

[so I don't think so but if you have gi](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m52s)

[hooks that aren't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m56s)

[Turing um something to do with lfs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h36m58s)

[apparently I could](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m03s)

[certain is lfs stores data in a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m08s)

[separate location so that it's not the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m14s)

[the regular Deltas files under GI hooks](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m17s)

[yes so you've got a script under one of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m21s)

[your gith Hooks and I'm guessing it must](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m23s)

[return a nonzero](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m26s)

[status code pre and post ones okay so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m28s)

[like a a pre push and post are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m30s)

[similar they keep being recreated the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m40s)

[tags really shouldn't be getting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m42s)

[recreated the one thing that is um worth](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m44s)

[noting here is the tags inside of get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m48s)

[Kraken unlike branches that nicely show](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m51s)

[up the uh I've never added](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h37m56s)

[anything um tags show up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m01s)

[as both local and remote under the same](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m05s)

[thing and it's kind of annoying right so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m08s)

[like I've got this 510 tag and Visually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m11s)

[there's no way for me to tell that this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m15s)

[that there's actually two tags here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m18s)

[right so I've got I've got the remote](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m20s)

[tag um and I've got the and I've got the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m24s)

[local Tag books just keep appearing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m28s)

[after doing a poll so I'm wondering are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m31s)

[you doing a delete on both because I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m34s)

[have seen issues around like deletes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m38s)

[when when people do a uh they delete the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m42s)

[local tag and not necessarily the remote](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m44s)

[one because then a pull or a fetch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m47s)

[definitely re- retrieves that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m49s)

[information all the way back](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m51s)

[down because I I'd be willing to bet if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m54s)

[there if they're magically reappearing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h38m57s)

[either either on a pole or if you've got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m00s)

[the what's the yeah the autof fetch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m03s)

[interval roughly around a minute it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m06s)

[mostly happens on push okay though I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m08s)

[think most of the time the pushes in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m11s)

[Kraken end up doing a fetch I've got an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m14s)

[interesting thing on one of my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m16s)

[repositories with my um GitHub](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m17s)

[authentication where it makes me](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m21s)

[reauthenticate every time until I set](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m23s)

[the appropriate user cuz I have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m25s)

[multiple um which unfortunately means](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m28s)

[all of the operations in get Kraken that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m30s)

[use the CLI I can tell because it pops](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m32s)

[my authentication window every time it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m35s)

[somewhat annoying um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m37s)

[but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m40s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m45s)

[Right double check make sure we actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m47s)

[got that one out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m49s)

[um but the are if you right click on it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m52s)

[and delete the one from your remote](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m57s)

[first and then delete the one locally do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h39m59s)

[they still show back up I'd be surprised](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m01s)

[if I mean it's possible if you've got a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m05s)

[hook that is returning a nonzero exit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m07s)

[code I have seen issues with cracken](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m10s)

[like on that last one right where there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m13s)

[was an error when deleting the work tree](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m16s)

[but it still removed the work tree here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m18s)

[right it so I think it's updating the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m22s)

[the main it database the repo first and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m25s)

[deleting the file second which means](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m29s)

[that the file delete fails it's already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m31s)

[removed so I have seing UI things like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m33s)

[that where I mean of when something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m36s)

[fails because of order of operations](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m39s)

[it's not like it's one big transaction](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m42s)

[so you've gotten halfway through the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m45s)

[process I'm I'd be curious on that but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m48s)

[yeah let me know if if you're able to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m51s)

[test](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m54s)

[it right click on a tag if you're trying](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m55s)

[to delete delete from uh the remote](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h40m58s)

[first in my case origin and then delete](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m01s)

[locally and then do a a push or or a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m03s)

[fetch or a pull and see what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m06s)

[happens because you can do the under](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m10s)

[underneath your pole you can hit fetch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m13s)

[all and that usually should retrieve](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m15s)

[everything I but I am curious if you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m17s)

[delete the remote tag first and then the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m19s)

[local and again because get Kraken](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m21s)

[doesn't show a difference in sorry this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m24s)

[thing is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m26s)

[uh because get Kraken doesn't show a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m28s)

[difference](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m29s)

[in the display of remote versus local](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m32s)

[tags they're all just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m34s)

[tag I get but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m37s)

[it okay so I think the issue that I see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m41s)

[here immediately is if I try to create a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h41m45s)

[do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m00s)

[there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m02s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m05s)

[cancel oh there's another interesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m08s)

[thing I cancel I still wanted to do this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m11s)

[but I can come](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m15s)

[here I've got I've now got I assume a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m16s)

[main and a master okay if I go through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m19s)

[and do another](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m22s)

[one right create work tree from this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m24s)

[commit uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m28s)

[see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m31s)

[work right create work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m33s)

[tree cancel close the dialogue even when](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m35s)

[I cancel you then I can keep](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m39s)

[going but what I'm interested in now is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m42s)

[I've got pain I've got work hey I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m45s)

[willing to bet my colleague's problem](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m50s)

[was trying to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m52s)

[this um with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m55s)

[branches what has it worked for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h42m58s)

[you missing out on the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m04s)

[coolness uh it is it is not quite a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m06s)

[bridge so think of it closer as a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m09s)

[replacement for if you've ever cloned](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m13s)

[your repository multiple times simply](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m15s)

[because you wanted to have uh two local](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m18s)

[copies so the the work Tree in this case](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m21s)

[so material design toolkit this is my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m25s)

[main repository and the key thing to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m27s)

[note here I've got this little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m29s)

[dogful right and if I back out and go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m32s)

[here you'll knowe if I jump into here I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m36s)

[have no dogit full right instead I've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m39s)

[got a little dogit file which points](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m43s)

[back to where it was but now I've got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m46s)

[something and and actually this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m49s)

[probably where're showing off right so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m50s)

[if I look at the properties of this this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m52s)

[folder is 23. seven Megs right if I go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m54s)

[back to my main](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h43m59s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m01s)

[properties it's a little bit bigger like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m04s)

[a lot bigger so the advantage of a work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m08s)

[tree is you get to share the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m11s)

[same uh git database to your dogit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m16s)

[directory but you can effectively have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m19s)

[multiple uh clones or clones are the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m22s)

[wrong words multiple directories all](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m26s)

[sharing that same git database so rather](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m28s)

[than having to clone multiple times you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m31s)

[can have uh these work trees to be able](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m33s)

[to go through and leverage so it gives](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m36s)

[you a nice easy way so common use cases](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m39s)

[are oftentimes like PR](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m42s)

[review or some people even like using](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m44s)

[them](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m47s)

[for uh similar to branches but uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m48s)

[separate streams of work so rather than](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m53s)

[switching back and forth between two](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m55s)

[different branches uh especially when](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m57s)

[there's like you know you push up the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h44m59s)

[the branch you open the pull request you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m02s)

[go onto the next task well then you get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m04s)

[PR feedback it's like well okay shoot I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m06s)

[got to pause go over and address this if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m08s)

[you have two separate work trees just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m10s)

[switch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m13s)

[directory right you just go back to that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m14s)

[other directory where you were off and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m16s)

[of don't quite work perfectly the way I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m44s)

[want but it does get me pretty close to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m48s)

[the way there because now I can switch](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m51s)

[into my my main work tree I can always](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m53s)

[go back to the to the master one if I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h45m56s)

[things I am curious though if we go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m23s)

[through and make a change here real](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m25s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m26s)

[I because I checked out from a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m29s)

[commit I should be on a detached head so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m31s)

[I imagine I'm going to get bit with the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m35s)

[idea of well you're not on a branch so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m37s)

[that may end up being an interesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m41s)

[problem but I I I'm willing to bet once](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m43s)

[I check out from](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m45s)

[commit because I've got a local well](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m48s)

[even though I did it from commit it just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m51s)

[made the branch pointed at that commit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m52s)

[that might be okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m55s)

[it be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h48m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m03s)

[uh yeah I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m08s)

[think my colleagues issue was probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m13s)

[around the the subtle difference](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m17s)

[between which one's the house and which](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m21s)

[one's the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m23s)

[tree uh um because this should this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m25s)

[should just behave solution](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m28s)

[explor right so I go something like that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m33s)

[it doesn't matter Whit space change is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m36s)

[good right so if I go here stage all](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m38s)

[changes uh just testing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m42s)

[work it changes right like I am working](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m46s)

[on a branch I am in a completely](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m49s)

[separate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m52s)

[directory I can do all the needful](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h49m54s)

[we can just go back to our main work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h50m32s)

[all done with this and we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h50m36s)

[it's it's kind of kind of like uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m03s)

[sneaker net only you have to do it for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m06s)

[minor you minor ux things but I overall](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m15s)

[the other thing that I'm not sure I like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m20s)

[is it doesn't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m22s)

[remove it doesn't look like it removes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m24s)

[work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m28s)

[tree not sure how I feel about that I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m29s)

[feel like I wanted to clear clean up the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m31s)

[local branch that goes with it because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m33s)

[otherwise create workspace delete](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m36s)

[workspace like I expect delete to invert](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m38s)

[create and instead now I have to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m42s)

[extra cleanup I mean it's not a big deal](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m44s)

[to me because functionally we get into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m46s)

[this situation](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m49s)

[where uh check out orig](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m51s)

[MC cuz the end of the day we just kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m55s)

[of get into these situations](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m57s)

[where I I often times just declare](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h51m59s)

[bankruptcy and uh nuke all of the the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m02s)

[local branches like I don't want to look](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m07s)

[at you anymore go away and then it it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m09s)

[goes away and fixes it okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m11s)

[uh let's take a quick Gander](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m14s)

[at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m18s)

[uh take a quick Gander at a couple of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m20s)

[these poll requests and then I was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m23s)

[hoping to do a little stuff](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m24s)

[with Bop Pac and Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m27s)

[installers uh okay so slider tool tip](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m30s)

[not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m34s)

[showing uh this is the one we looked at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m36s)

[be oh this is the one from last time](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m39s)

[that I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m43s)

[think was a password box so we're just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m45s)

[going to kick this because I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m48s)

[assume there is it is very unlikely](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m51s)

[that this test is well maybe we should](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m56s)

[look at this test real quick and see why](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h52m59s)

[did it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m02s)

[fail](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m04s)

[uh oh that's not the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m09s)

[test hang on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m12s)

[um values differ expect a 's new Roman](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m16s)

[context menus follows textbox font](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m21s)

[family this didn't change anything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m25s)

[around that code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m28s)

[though shouldn't have changed anything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m35s)

[around that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m37s)

[code so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m38s)

[let's let's let's try this guy out uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m41s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m45s)

[here see we're going to go to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m46s)

[here glider tool](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m55s)

[tip oh we should have done it as a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h53m58s)

[workspace we can we now that we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m01s)

[here or I'm sorry not not workspace work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m04s)

[tree](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m07s)

[wow uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m10s)

[see yeah I kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m14s)

[wish if I do this and I do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m16s)

[this will it will it yeah it won't let](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m20s)

[me dang it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m24s)

[I got to go back here kind of annoying I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m27s)

[I I kind of wish it would let](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m30s)

[me redo my my way into this so what I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m33s)

[would like to do is create work tree](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m37s)

[from and then create work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m39s)

[Tree open now then it would be much](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m42s)

[nicer if it remembered right directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m45s)

[to open so I didn't have to do this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m48s)

[manually then let's let go just take a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m55s)

[quick Gander at this since I'm the one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m57s)

[who pushed last kind of feel a mild urge](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h54m58s)

[to double check this test I also don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m01s)

[like that some of these tests are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m04s)

[fragile because it's fairly obnoxious](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m06s)

[having](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m09s)

[things that just blindly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m10s)

[fail so I'm going to bet that if I rerun](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m14s)

[this test loc probably pass](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m17s)

[because it was this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m29s)

[here and it's it's possible that this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m33s)

[Runner dependent as well because this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m36s)

[reaching into the font](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m38s)

[families right so that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m44s)

[passes uh let's see textbox](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m47s)

[font font](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m51s)

[family family names](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h55m53s)

[uh I kind of feel like this like I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m00s)

[think this is going to change](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m03s)

[it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m05s)

[um feel like this should be in aert](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m06s)

[contains rather than](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m09s)

[a and I think aert contains is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m13s)

[collection then value I remember right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m16s)

[uh nope the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m20s)

[opposite the problem here no no ability](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m22s)

[values oh because of this it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m30s)

[nullable](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m39s)

[okay interesting that that failed like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m45s)

[that I just want to look at the the logs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m49s)

[here get element content](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m52s)

[get property font family get it called](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m56s)

[get property](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h56m59s)

[twice interesting why did it call get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m02s)

[property](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m05s)

[twice because there's the get element oh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m07s)

[get property context menu on the element](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m10s)

[perhaps no get element contact menu get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m16s)

[property font family does it pull the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m20s)

[font family from both](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m22s)

[there's the second](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m26s)

[one let's see so this guy here oh did it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m37s)

[actually fail which line did this fail](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m40s)

[on what's the assert line 3](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m43s)

[23 so it actually failed on this one not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m49s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m52s)

[how does this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h57m58s)

[pass and I'm only saying that because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m01s)

[font family here should be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m04s)

[um I don't understand does font family](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m10s)

[have equality oh it overrides](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m13s)

[equals that's how it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m16s)

[works right so when you do an assert](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m19s)

[equals um it's going to check the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m22s)

[default equality of the two types which](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m26s)

[often times for reference types is going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m29s)

[to be calling the equals method and in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m31s)

[this case font family apparently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m34s)

[overrides equals which we'd have to go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m36s)

[look at its implementation but I'm going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m38s)

[to guess that it's a sane](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m39s)

[implementation given that this test](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m42s)

[passed on my machine so this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m44s)

[here so on the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m47s)

[failure uh it expected Times New Roman](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m50s)

[got Ser cogi or whatever](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h58m53s)

[why would that have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m00s)

[occurred I guess the question is for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m07s)

[context menu how did we implement](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m11s)

[this if I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m18s)

[do uh get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m20s)

[blame everyone added this description](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m23s)

[attribute is probably the commit that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m26s)

[did](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m29s)

[it uh let's see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=00h59m33s)

[see change this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m30s)

[up side adding retry](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m33s)

[we can go back to the main one and we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m49s)

[have and now if that thing fails again I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m51s)

[don't have to worry about switching](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m53s)

[branches nearly as much](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m54s)

[all right so World becomes a much much](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h01m56s)

[goes here and I think proven run I kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m02s)

[of wish if I was the one who pushed last](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m07s)

[like if somebody with contributor rights](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m11s)

[pushes last you and it was already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m14s)

[approved before you can probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m15s)

[cons like somebody with push access I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m20s)

[guess technically I push to a different](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m25s)

[Fork so I kind of get it but it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m28s)

[like okay so let's see fixing Cod style](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m32s)

[issues we can probably approve and run](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m37s)

[this one blindly because I've looked at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m39s)

[it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m40s)

[before uh okay so what do we got here so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m41s)

[we got a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m45s)

[depend oh it's interesting that the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m46s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m51s)

[fine uh let's see zaml test Rev](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h02m52s)

[I'm curious about this this looks like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m02s)

[something might these dock](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m05s)

[changes this looks like something needs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m08s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m10s)

[rebased I have a strange](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m12s)

[suspicion let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m14s)

[look let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m16s)

[see add](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m29s)

[remote](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m36s)

[okay Ah that's the issue so here's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m41s)

[here's what's going on right so there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m45s)

[are quite a few changes in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m49s)

[here um but it looks like this may have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m52s)

[been a rebase](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m54s)

[uh or similar because I see a co-author](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m57s)

[in here on a lot of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h03m59s)

[these and it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m01s)

[the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m04s)

[JLG user on all of them and these are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m06s)

[all commits that it previously made it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m09s)

[in so and I'm I'm just watching this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m12s)

[pink line right here right so if we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m15s)

[um if we grab code style here right and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m21s)

[we're going going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m25s)

[to solo code style solo master all right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m27s)

[so if we follow these down we can see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m31s)

[that code style and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m33s)

[master this is where they deviated but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m35s)

[these are the two commits in questions](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m37s)

[that are probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m39s)

[interesting um it looks like what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m40s)

[happened is these two commits were](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m43s)

[done hey guy thank you for the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m48s)

[raid hopefully you had a wonderful](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m52s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m54s)

[welcome everyone we are currently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m56s)

[reviewing some PRS on the material](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h04m58s)

[design in zaml project using my favorite](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m01s)

[tool get Kraken I am heavily biased and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m04s)

[love the tool very much um so in this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m07s)

[case I think it was commit commit and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m12s)

[then we have a string of commits that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m15s)

[got rebased on top so I'm willing to bet](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m17s)

[what happened was the the pr got out of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m20s)

[date and then the rebase was done in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m23s)

[wrong direction rather than rebasing the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m27s)

[feature branch in this case code Style](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m29s)

[on top of master master was rebased on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m31s)

[top of code style I think that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m34s)

[probably what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m37s)

[happened just making breakfast though](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m39s)

[dang](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m41s)

[so uh you are very much in a different](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m43s)

[time zone than me I it is nearly 10:30](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m46s)

[my time okay so the question then comes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m49s)

[how do we fix this right uh hang on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m52s)

[Shameless self-promotion time bit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m56s)

[cracken workshops so on the note of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h05m58s)

[fixing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m01s)

[stuff um I recently did a uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m02s)

[Workshop](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m06s)

[uh this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m11s)

[interesting save time with get work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m13s)

[trees I mean this is looking good but I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m17s)

[think they may have left my picture here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m20s)

[I don't know that I'm doing this talk](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m22s)

[huh I wonder if I'm doing this talk I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m26s)

[should](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m29s)

[check anyway the one I was going to show](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m30s)

[off was this one um how to undo G](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m33s)

[mistakes this this this guy here so if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m36s)

[anybody's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m39s)

[interested it's always nice when you go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m41s)

[to show something off and you see your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m43s)

[picture and go huh I'm now trying to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m45s)

[think back because I've been asked to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m48s)

[a lot of talks recently and for those](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m49s)

[people who are new I I moved a couple](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m51s)

[months ago we had a house my world was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m54s)

[chaos um I was scrambling to remember](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h06m56s)

[how to do everything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m00s)

[so huh doesn't say who's doing this one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m02s)

[but that's my picture well that's that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m06s)

[exciting uh Florida uh further over](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m10s)

[you're you're close right country uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m13s)

[Washington State so West Coast](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m15s)

[us yeah uh but for fixing git mistakes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m19s)

[this Workshop down here now live on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m24s)

[YouTube feel free to check it out we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m26s)

[going to leverage some of the some of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m28s)

[the stuff that that I do in there so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m30s)

[functionally what we would like to do is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m32s)

[we would like to take this code style](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m34s)

[one now this contributor has contributed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m36s)

[before and so I'm fairly confident I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m38s)

[have Push access back to their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m41s)

[repository so step one we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m43s)

[undo the mistake all right so we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m46s)

[going to just go here we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m48s)

[reset hard and just back it all the way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m49s)

[up right because these are the two](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m51s)

[commits that actually look like they](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m53s)

[were intentional and then what we'll do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m55s)

[is we will just take this and I'm going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m58s)

[to drag it on top of Master and I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h07m59s)

[going to then rebase code style onto](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m02s)

[master I think the rebase was probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m05s)

[done in the other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m07s)

[direction okay and then now we've got a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m09s)

[handful of merge conflicts so let's take](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m12s)

[take a little peky at what these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m16s)

[are okay so let's see here floating hint](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m19s)

[what do we got going on here because we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m23s)

[probably want to take Master on just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m24s)

[about](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m27s)

[everything yeah because this was these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m31s)

[were changes that were done so I think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m35s)

[we're probably just going to take Master](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m37s)

[across the board cuz the change here was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m38s)

[uh a rename of some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m41s)

[converters we might just go back and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m43s)

[double check this before we before we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m45s)

[push okay so there's there's the changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m49s)

[there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m53s)

[and I'm going to turn off the soloing so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m57s)

[that I can so I can get a view of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h08m59s)

[view of the wild so specifically I want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m02s)

[to just double check the the changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m04s)

[that were made to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m06s)

[those uh converters just to make sure](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m08s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m11s)

[clear it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m13s)

[switched so an inline return versus](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m16s)

[curly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m19s)

[braces so this one here I'm not overly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m22s)

[I in general if an if I don't mind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m26s)

[inline return statements on C when the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m29s)

[if statement is we'll say trivial and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m32s)

[trivial in this case is very subjective](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m35s)

[like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m38s)

[there's um there's not a lot like I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m40s)

[actually hang on let me see if I can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m42s)

[find it real quick I sent some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m44s)

[colleagues of mine some code from last](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m46s)

[weekend](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m49s)

[where I I shot myself in the foot with a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m50s)

[very very](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m54s)

[bad yeah here here it is one second let](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h09m57s)

[me me just extract it so I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m01s)

[accidentally show show wrong stuff right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m02s)

[so right so I spent a great deal of time](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m07s)

[staring at this code longer than I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m10s)

[going to admit trying to figure out why](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m13s)

[Visual Studio was convinced I minus](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m15s)

[minus was unreachable I I stared at this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m18s)

[for a very long time and I went why does](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m20s)

[it think I I'm never going to decrement](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m23s)

[I the whole point of this was I'm trying](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m26s)

[to count backwards right because when](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m28s)

[you do the remove at this iterating](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m32s)

[backwards through a list is a nice](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m34s)

[cheater way of handling](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m36s)

[it there's there's something wrong why](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m37s)

[why is Visual Studio telling me this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m40s)

[yeah yeah for those people who aren't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m42s)

[seeing it here's a hint that return is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m45s)

[very poorly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m48s)

[indented I I had done some moving of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m50s)

[code around and I I had formatted the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m52s)

[file and this return statement was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m56s)

[indented making it look like it was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h10m59s)

[inside the if this is C Shar that's not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m00s)

[how it works this return statement is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m03s)

[functionally right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m06s)

[here yeah so that was exciting don't be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m08s)

[an idiot don't be like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m12s)

[me so some of these may be a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m14s)

[little aggressive on the the in lines](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m17s)

[like some of these ones here this this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m21s)

[one doesn't bother me right like that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m23s)

[that's probably perfectly fine but I but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m26s)

[something like this where it's being](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m29s)

[built](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m31s)

[up I don't know once if the the list](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m32s)

[pattern match spans multiple lines I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m35s)

[kind of feel like I like keeping the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m38s)

[ones here again what is what is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m40s)

[trivial uh if condition is highly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m43s)

[subjective highly subjective okay so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m46s)

[that'll fix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m50s)

[that let's let's let's let's work treat](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m52s)

[the sucker again yeah yeah um so let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m55s)

[start with this if we push this let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h11m59s)

[just make](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m01s)

[sure I have Force push permissions onto](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m02s)

[a different](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m05s)

[Fork](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m06s)

[oh okay um I would like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m09s)

[to well we're already on it so let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m14s)

[just let's just jump](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m16s)

[in we'll just pop the branch and go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m18s)

[because I I think there's a couple of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m20s)

[these that I'm just going to fix like on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m22s)

[one hand could go through and and make](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m24s)

[er](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m27s)

[requests but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m28s)

[this sometimes it's just easier to get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m30s)

[in and fix it really quick and this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m33s)

[particular contributor has been doing a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m35s)

[ton of code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m37s)

[cleanup and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m38s)

[so I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m40s)

[mind see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m43s)

[let's oh see this is also nice a better](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m47s)

[air](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m51s)

[message uh though I'm not sure why I got](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m53s)

[an airor message the first time and not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m55s)

[a second time so that's exciting okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m56s)

[and I'm sure my big head was in the way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h12m59s)

[so let's take a look at which of these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m01s)

[that one's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m03s)

[fine that one's fine I'm really just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m05s)

[looking for it okay so floating hint](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m09s)

[initial horizontal offset let's start](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m11s)

[there let's see this is going to be down](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m14s)

[here uh let's see floating hint initial](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m22s)

[horizontal offset](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m25s)

[conver yeah I think this one we're going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m28s)

[to put the curly braces back on it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m30s)

[just when the list pattern match has to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m32s)

[span across the lines and I think we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m33s)

[going to just unindent](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m36s)

[that that are we think we indent all](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m39s)

[that might make it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m44s)

[clear it's hard it's hard to say like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m45s)

[the list pattern matches new enough that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m48s)

[I yeah yeah we'll go with it okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m51s)

[uh that one's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m55s)

[unchanged uh hint margin](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h13m58s)

[converter revert that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m01s)

[one least clean it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m04s)

[up yeah cuz this one here it looks like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m07s)

[he landed on the same thing Square](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m10s)

[braces on their own lines everything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m13s)

[indented huzzah right there's nice](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m14s)

[symmetry there now that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m17s)

[fine uh floating hint text block marging](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m19s)

[loading hint text blocks](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m25s)

[margin we'll just put these ones](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m30s)

[back goes there that goes there that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m33s)

[goes there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m35s)

[great works out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m37s)

[well works out great okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m40s)

[so that's fine that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m44s)

[fine I will say I do appreciate people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m49s)

[going through and cleaning up code like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m52s)

[I often do some of this cleanup but this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m53s)

[is one of those areas some people don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m56s)

[like PRS that just do code cleanup like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h14m58s)

[this I actually kind of enjoy it as long](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m01s)

[as it's going in the the direction of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m03s)

[what the the rest of the repo is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m05s)

[doing because you know sometimes feel](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m08s)

[like oh we'll just do you know big uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m11s)

[you know refactor Auto cleanup ones](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m13s)

[which is fine that works but on an OP](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m16s)

[source project it actually can be kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m19s)

[of problematic because it it breaks a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m20s)

[lot of people like on a a regular](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m23s)

[project on a Dev team you're usually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m26s)

[breaking just the people on your Dev](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m28s)

[team on an open source project you're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m30s)

[potentially breaking every contributor](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m33s)

[and slowing them down which is not great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m35s)

[math converter test even implemented the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m39s)

[converts and this is totally fine I I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m43s)

[will I'll point one thing out that some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m46s)

[people will squawk at is there are uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m48s)

[some comments on unit tests that unit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m53s)

[tests should follow the arrange act](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m55s)

[assert pattern and should have single](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h15m57s)

[single assertions right so if I go math](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m01s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m03s)

[test uh this one right so some people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m08s)

[would argue well this this isn't quite](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m11s)

[right what it actually should be is you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m13s)

[know if we do the arrange act assert](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m17s)

[pattern here's your arrange here's your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m19s)

[act here's your asserts simple right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m25s)

[the the idea of a single asserts like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m28s)

[well by doing this you're now testing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m30s)

[two different things right uh none](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m32s)

[double argument should return do nothing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m35s)

[right so functionally this thing goes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m38s)

[through and says well you've got uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m40s)

[empty string](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m43s)

[and hang on now I want to look at this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m45s)

[converter oh I think it it it does it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m51s)

[with the parameter doesn't it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m53s)

[yeah so it's it's testing the the case](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m56s)

[of here and here right that's that's a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h16m59s)

[symmetry between them and so the idea is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m02s)

[it's like well you're technically](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m04s)

[testing two separate things and so this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m06s)

[feels weird it's like I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m08s)

[care that much as long as the test reads](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m10s)

[well um I'm fine with it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m13s)

[the for people who are overly pedantic](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m16s)

[the the clear way to do this is make it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m19s)

[a data driven test right so what you end](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m21s)

[up doing you end up doing something like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m24s)

[object value uh object](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m27s)

[parameter right and you do something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m31s)

[like this and then you do inline data](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m33s)

[and it becomes there and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m36s)

[1.0 right and then you come down here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m39s)

[and it becomes we grab the 1.0 the empty](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m41s)

[string here so we do 1.](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m44s)

[o empty string here right this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m48s)

[becomes value](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m53s)

[parameter right and then you don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h17m57s)

[need you are now down to a single assert](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m01s)

[and I will say when people advocate for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m05s)

[a single assert in a unit test I usually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m07s)

[go I get that right the the guideline](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m09s)

[here is unit test should test one thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m13s)

[and so some people take that to the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m17s)

[extreme and say that means a single](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m18s)

[assert it's like that's a little too](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m20s)

[extreme I agree that tests should test](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m23s)

[one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m26s)

[thing but one logical assertion you like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m28s)

[if you find yourself needing you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m32s)

[conjunctions in your test names that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m34s)

[probably an indication you've gone off](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m36s)

[the deep Ed but so something like this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m37s)

[is a way of doing it honestly but I my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m40s)

[opinion this is just as readable right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m44s)

[and the question is what are what are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m48s)

[what is the failure case we're actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m51s)

[guarding against here it's like this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m52s)

[so small it's not a big deal uh go for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m54s)

[uh what is it Behavior driven design uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h18m58s)

[where possible push test generation up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m02s)

[the chain of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m05s)

[command am I getting that right bdd](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m06s)

[Behavior driven](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m09s)

[design behavior-driven](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m13s)

[development I I I knew I knew I had](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m20s)

[gotten it somewhat close somewhat](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m22s)

[close yeah and I think this is the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m29s)

[argument for things like uh cucumber](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m32s)

[business driven design in my case yeah](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m36s)

[and and honestly one of the best](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m38s)

[projects I ever worked on um there was a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m40s)

[lead Dev that was very pedantic about](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m44s)

[making sure that every business](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m46s)

[requirement that came down the pipe](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m48s)

[there must be at least a one test for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m50s)

[that for that requirement and it it it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m53s)

[was kind of annoying but at the same](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m57s)

[time we had](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h19m59s)

[very like if there was an issue it was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m00s)

[with the design not with the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m04s)

[code and it was it was really convenient](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m06s)

[especially when you'd get a conflicting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m09s)

[requirement later on you'd go to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m11s)

[implement it and if a test broke you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m13s)

[knew that you had violated a business](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m15s)

[rule that had come in at some point and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m17s)

[so then you could go back to the the PO](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m19s)

[and go okay look you're asking for this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m21s)

[but we would need to change this other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m24s)

[documentation okay so I think that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m35s)

[fine just going to push these changes uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m37s)

[braces uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m49s)

[doing doing this when the if statement](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m52s)

[is not rval and spelling is difficult](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h20m58s)

[which is why we use a spell](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h21m03s)

[checker](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h21m05s)

[requirments are well defined that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h21m24s)

[usually what saves AI from taking my job](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h21m26s)

[of good uh stuff there going through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m16s)

[so uh okay so given](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m18s)

[that so that's where we're going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m22s)

[one of the requests and this this is I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m24s)

[think one of the requests](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m27s)

[for I don't know I don't know why it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m42s)

[took so long to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m44s)

[load uh is there is this issue here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m46s)

[support wizardy installer on windows so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m50s)

[the the only issue with the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m53s)

[windows-based installers is you get a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m55s)

[setup.exe it's great uh the problem is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h27m57s)

[this doesn't give us](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m01s)

[the the the ease of integration that we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m04s)

[would want uh on Windows because the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m07s)

[installer goes very quickly but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m10s)

[oftentimes people have more that they](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m12s)

[want the installer to do um and so one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m14s)

[of the the big ones is right now the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m17s)

[installer installs uh on a per user](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m20s)

[basis but if you want to install into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m23s)

[say program files that requires](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m26s)

[elevation right program files is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m29s)

[protected directory on Windows you you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m31s)

[can't have just non-admin users](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m33s)

[installing there uh it's often used to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m35s)

[protect things etc etc etc so for people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m38s)

[who want to go down that route the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m41s)

[intent here was to build to allow velop](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m44s)

[Pac to also produce an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m47s)

[MSI looking at Wix at the moment um as a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m49s)

[way of producing that um and as part of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m52s)

[producing the MSI what would be kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m55s)

[convenient is if we could go through and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h28m57s)

[uh prompt extra information so that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m01s)

[kind of where I was thinking of going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m04s)

[and looking at this so I will clarify](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m07s)

[something I haven't played with Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m11s)

[since like Wix 3 Wix is now on so most](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m12s)

[people are running Wix 4 five depending](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m16s)

[on where you're at or I believe is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m18s)

[considered the stable one with five](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m21s)

[being new latest and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m24s)

[greatest at least that's that's kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m27s)

[what I can tell the big issue with Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m30s)

[is it's hard it's really bloody hard](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m32s)

[like you find conflicting documentations](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m36s)

[from different versions online like it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m38s)

[can produce really nice installers and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m41s)

[I've used it on other projects but it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m43s)

[not e it's really easy to screw it up I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m45s)

[don't like it I like easy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m47s)

[installers so um but the idea here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m50s)

[is uh we want to be able to go through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m55s)

[and have custom markdown Pages uh for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h29m58s)

[things like welcome read me license](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m02s)

[conclusion that kind of thing should be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m05s)

[great um we want to allow picking of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m08s)

[where to install the the application](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m11s)

[right so appdate is our default program](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m14s)

[files user provided directory etc etc](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m17s)

[etc for people who maybe have different](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m20s)

[drives or whatever](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m22s)

[um and and then we're going to go from](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m25s)

[there so these top two are kind of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m27s)

[big ones this most people who are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m29s)

[looking for an MSI based thing it it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m32s)

[this it's this top thing here uh a few](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m36s)

[people are are uh really wanting things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m39s)

[around like the readme license option as](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m41s)

[well like people have asked for the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m44s)

[welcome and conclusion I don't think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m46s)

[that's a block of I think those are nice](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m47s)

[to have for a lot of people but their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m50s)

[their big thing is hey I I can't have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m52s)

[people installing my app without you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m54s)

[know accepting a licensing agreement or](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m55s)

[something right um often times the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h30m57s)

[workaround for most people is I'll just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m00s)

[do it on the first run of the app](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m02s)

[metalac gives you hooks so that you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m04s)

[if you're a first run app and then you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m07s)

[can do stuff so often times just rather](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m09s)

[than doing it as the installer you do it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m12s)

[on launch that's the easy way around it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m13s)

[but we're going to we're going to try to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m16s)

[offer something here obviously the MSI](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m18s)

[is Windows only uh and will not work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m20s)

[elsewhere but this is a Windows option](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m23s)

[the other thing that is subtly being](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m25s)

[implied here is if you're installed into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m27s)

[program files when you do the updates](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m31s)

[we're going to have to do some changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m34s)

[to our update process to handle](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m35s)

[requesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m37s)

[elevation because to do the update into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m39s)

[program files you're going to need to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m43s)

[able to have um that update feature as](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m45s)

[well so what I have done so far](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m49s)

[there is uh a handful of places online](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m55s)

[that I was playing around and I I found](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h31m58s)

[a lovely](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m00s)

[repository um this Wix installers](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m02s)

[one and we'll just we'll just share it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m07s)

[out because this is I found I found this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m11s)

[to be rather helpful right it's a few](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m14s)

[months old but it but at least it has I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m18s)

[I I I appreciated the author calling out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m21s)

[hey I used version 3141 of Wix great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m24s)

[that was a good level set of okay here's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m28s)

[what I expect to find I'd like to to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m30s)

[something slightly newer but at least](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m33s)

[this gives me uh a way to go the other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m36s)

[thing that is changed with Wix is there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m39s)

[is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m42s)

[a uh let's see Wix Studio extension it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m43s)

[fire something something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m49s)

[something um that comes with this is the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m51s)

[Wix 3 one there's a third party that has](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m55s)

[produced a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h32m58s)

[new thingy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m00s)

[and fire giant that's the one um which](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m03s)

[is nice because now there's corporate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m08s)

[support the the Wix tool set is still](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m10s)

[free there's a a newer extension all of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m12s)

[that stuff for visual studio to try to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m15s)

[make your authoring much easier which is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m17s)

[really cool right all of that's nice the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m19s)

[problem I have is I need to do this in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m22s)

[an automated way uh with velop Pac I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m24s)

[not looking to just author an installer](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m27s)

[inside of Visual Studio which is what a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m30s)

[lot of these things would end up giving](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m32s)

[great fine Off to the Races but what I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m34s)

[have done instead is I have gone through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m38s)

[and I probably should Fork this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m40s)

[repository so I can play in my own area](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m41s)

[and actually push stuff back is I have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m44s)

[been playing around with building out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m47s)

[I've got this little build script with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m50s)

[doing embedded uis in side of the Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m51s)

[installer so this gives us a a nice](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m56s)

[little option so you'll note and this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h33m59s)

[this is the area where things start to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m03s)

[get a little a little confusing and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m04s)

[especially things have changed in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m07s)

[Wix version so I've had to tweak things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m09s)

[to be happier um but this is leveraging](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m12s)

[a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m16s)

[WPF UI that gets launched inside of Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m17s)

[which I was like hey that's that that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m23s)

[pretty cool um there is also this custom](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m25s)

[action down here and I I'm going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m29s)

[point something out Target framework net](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m31s)

[20 this I found to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m36s)

[hysterical right I did not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m39s)

[realize that the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m42s)

[TFM](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m46s)

[so framework tfms so there are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m47s)

[a nice table here right showing you all](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m54s)

[your so people who don't know TFM Target](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m57s)

[framework monitor uh it's a big long](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h34m59s)

[word that means version of net that I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m02s)

[want to Target that's it it's no more](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m04s)

[complicated than that but we come down](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m06s)

[here and we see that NET Framework](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m08s)

[actually has net 11 net 20 net 35 40 all](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m10s)

[the way up so these are all of the Net](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m15s)

[Framework](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m17s)

[versions right the one that baffles me a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m18s)

[little bit right is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m22s)

[I I kind of wonder what they're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m25s)

[do cuz this hasn't been updated yet for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m27s)

[oh I guess they've got net n](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m30s)

[there I I was expecting that to see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m32s)

[something down here for net n as well](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m35s)

[but I guess they haven't they only added](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m37s)

[it above that's fine right so they've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m38s)

[got net](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m41s)

[9.0 I see a confusion Point happening](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m43s)

[when we get to net 11 and we have net 1](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m45s)

[one and net what I assume will be 1.0](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m49s)

[there's no way that causes any confusion](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m55s)

[for people I I I'm I'm calling it now in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h35m58s)

[two years that is one of the most common](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m01s)

[bugs for people doing SDK projects is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m04s)

[they forget the dot zero on the end and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m06s)

[shot themselves in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m09s)

[foot that's that's my working](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m13s)

[Theory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m16s)

[um so yeah that'll be that'll be an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m18s)

[interesting thing so but due to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m21s)

[limitations here I got to write code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m24s)

[targeting NET Framework 2 know how long](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m26s)

[it's been since I've written code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m28s)

[against NET Framework](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m30s)

[20 but this was all around just trying](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m32s)

[to figure out how to do custom actions](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m35s)

[inside of Wix as well in fact you know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m37s)

[what let's take this repository let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m40s)

[actually make a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m42s)

[fork](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m44s)

[and and while you do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m46s)

[that um I want to go back here I this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m48s)

[guy deserves a star](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m52s)

[because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m55s)

[Robert Robert deserves a star because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m57s)

[these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h36m59s)

[were I found these to be rather helpful](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m00s)

[despite the fact that they were a little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m03s)

[different let's copy this and we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m04s)

[going to add a remote where's my Kraken](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m06s)

[where is my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m10s)

[Kraken uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m11s)

[see kind don't want to change this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m13s)

[guy to be something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m16s)

[like this edit remote right and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m20s)

[then kraken's already helpfully figured](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m24s)

[out that I have a fork thank you very](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m27s)

[much yes I would like to add it uh but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m29s)

[I'd kind of like to rename](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m32s)

[it edit I want you to be origin thank](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m34s)

[you shared settings lock file removed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m40s)

[while in use I don't know what that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m43s)

[means bit Kraken um that's exciting okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m46s)

[so let's see uh I added a manifest for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m52s)

[net uh Global tools to be able to pull](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m55s)

[this in this guy here I I added the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h37m58s)

[update code despite the fact that and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m02s)

[maybe we should discard this the the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m04s)

[first example works except for it um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m06s)

[throws a warning but I realize that the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m09s)

[warning is this is not upgradeable but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m13s)

[the very next one shows you how to add](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m15s)

[in the upgrade code so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m17s)

[it's like if you're starting with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m20s)

[something start at 01 in my opinion I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m22s)

[don't I personally don't like examples](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m25s)

[that don't leave you in a happy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m27s)

[place this doesn't leave you in a happy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m29s)

[place it does have the power s scripts](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m31s)

[in it though and there is a there is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m33s)

[useful read me kind of walking](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m35s)

[through what's going on here and how](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m37s)

[this plays out so like again it was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m40s)

[useful so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m42s)

[let's uh you know what we're just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m46s)

[gonna we're just going to push this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m49s)

[straight into my main](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m51s)

[uh currently just using Wix with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m56s)

[Harvester yeah yeah yeah yeah so and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h38m58s)

[that's that's the idea is he is Wix will](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m00s)

[always be more powerful than velop Pac](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m03s)

[in terms of total features and I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m06s)

[think we ever are going to like try to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m09s)

[expose all the things or even most of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m12s)

[the things because our Target is trying](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m14s)

[to keep things simple and the moment you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m17s)

[expose a lot of options it gets](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m19s)

[complicated and at at a certain point](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m22s)

[there that's probably just uh more](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m25s)

[difficult than it's worth um I am mildly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m28s)

[considering whether vpac will just like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m31s)

[should it be possible to dump the Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m34s)

[file via the the CLI that way there's a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m37s)

[are using](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m42s)

[it maybe right like that's that's a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m43s)

[people with an option to be able to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m49s)

[it and if you use the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m51s)

[um if you use Wix to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m54s)

[build uh your MSI for your installer you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h39m57s)

[could still use the velop PAC library to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m01s)

[do your updates at least after we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m03s)

[done with these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m05s)

[changes because the whole idea is the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m07s)

[bootstrapper that does the updates is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m09s)

[going to be watching for um access](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m12s)

[restrictions and then prompt the pop the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m16s)

[UAC prompt when you're in like program](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m19s)

[files or some right that way the the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m22s)

[updates can continue to work so I was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m25s)

[contemplating should should this allow](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m28s)

[for something like that it's like is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m30s)

[that useful if you're dropping into that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m32s)

[you probably don't want our file you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m35s)

[probably want something a little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m37s)

[more you a little less](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m39s)

[us I don't know](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m47s)

[that so we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m50s)

[just push that up while I've have it and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m52s)

[and get this guy going uh access](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m55s)

[denied uh that is because my remote is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h40m58s)

[still set to the wrong one that Upstream](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m00s)

[no point at that one now](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m04s)

[push there we go okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m08s)

[great now great that's all we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m11s)

[have okay so here's here's what we've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m15s)

[got right and if I take this guy and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m18s)

[it's generally a bad idea to test](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m21s)

[installers on your main machine you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m23s)

[should do it inside of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m26s)

[a Sandbox or similar we're going to run](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m28s)

[it straight on my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m31s)

[machine right the the key thing here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m32s)

[this is a markdown read me you'll note](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m35s)

[this is popping this thing up so what's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m39s)

[actually happening here I was quite](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m41s)

[proud of myself when I got this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m44s)

[working right so I've got this uh binary](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m46s)

[readme MD that's being added in uh uh to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m49s)

[to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m54s)

[this and then as part of the embedded](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m55s)

[UI here remember where where where I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h41m59s)

[ended up doing this because I I ended up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m03s)

[stealing some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m05s)

[stuff uh read me text this guy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m06s)

[here so inside of the initialize because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m11s)

[part of building uh an embedded UI with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m16s)

[Wix is you have to implement needed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m18s)

[interface where you get the session](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m21s)

[which gives you access to the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m23s)

[interesting stuff but if I can find a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m24s)

[binary entry with the name of readme](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m27s)

[file I can now pull out that markdown](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m30s)

[and in this case I just read it to a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m33s)

[string and shoved it up there but then](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m35s)

[we are able to go through and render it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m38s)

[it's like oh that's kind of convenient](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m40s)

[right so how we end up doing this is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m44s)

[little different but this gives us at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m47s)

[least a proof of concept and I think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m50s)

[what we can do is we can get or or try](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m52s)

[to get velop pack working with something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m55s)

[akin to this all right this I think is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h42m57s)

[pretty close as a starting point um the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m01s)

[other thing that we're that I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m05s)

[realizing we're going to end up needing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m06s)

[is the velop PAC tooling is going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m08s)

[need to pass through an update](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m10s)

[code because I don't know how else it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m14s)

[going to get it like you need a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m17s)

[consistent update code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m20s)

[again unless we let velop Pac gen this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m23s)

[and and load it in or similar like this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m26s)

[is where things it it starts to get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m29s)

[weird right like we could have velop Pac](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m31s)

[could just generate auxiliary Wix files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m35s)

[alongside an existing one to put it in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m38s)

[it's like there's there's all these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m40s)

[weird things um but then this is the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m42s)

[magical link](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m45s)

[into the embedded UI stuff so all of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m46s)

[that said jump over to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m55s)

[pack see uh this thing is here but let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h43m57s)

[go ahead and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m00s)

[make uh create work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m02s)

[tree actually let's just do a work tree](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m07s)

[over here right so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m09s)

[here uh reference](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m12s)

[checkout uh I really want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m15s)

[origin uh origin develop Y and then work](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m19s)

[tree branch to create let's do that's uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m24s)

[MSI](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m28s)

[install yeah that sounds](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m31s)

[great yeah go ahead and open great great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m35s)

[great great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m38s)

[great uh we're going to open this move](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m39s)

[this over here real quick while](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m42s)

[I jump](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m46s)

[out get mildly annoyed that the location](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m49s)

[is wrong](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m52s)

[and launch velop pack here this is one](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m54s)

[area where my comments before about uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h44m57s)

[one of the problems with work trees is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m01s)

[that it will be a clean](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m03s)

[directory with velop Pac because there's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m05s)

[so much extra stuff that kind of goes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m08s)

[into fing it like the build Pipeline on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m11s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m15s)

[insane if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m17s)

[a anybody want wants to see something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m21s)

[incredible](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m24s)

[um right like that's not where's the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m28s)

[where's the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m33s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m37s)

[what why am I confused oh build there's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m39s)

[the interesting one there's the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m42s)

[interesting one I I just can't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m44s)

[read right the the code path through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m46s)

[here starts to get real interesting real](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m49s)

[fast because you'll knowe there's in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m51s)

[order to compile this for all the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m53s)

[platforms to do all the things and then](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m56s)

[run the tests on all the things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h45m58s)

[it's it gets to be real interesting real](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m00s)

[fast so points to kayin he did a cool](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m03s)

[job of it uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m06s)

[okay oh we got more nougat package](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m13s)

[vulnerabilities to deal with yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m15s)

[yeah shut](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m17s)

[up go away go away Visual Studio I'll](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m18s)

[deal with those in a minute](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m21s)

[but we do have the new](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m27s)

[um uh renovate bot that is keeping](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m30s)

[things updated so in a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m34s)

[things are just getting revved for us](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m36s)

[for free so most of those Nate ones are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m39s)

[only vulnerabilities for a short period](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m43s)

[of time until renovate goes through and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m46s)

[revs all of them okay so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m48s)

[I think we're we we can start down here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h46m56s)

[we can kind of just work our way through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m00s)

[the tooling on this I think so VPK is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m03s)

[the entry point for our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m07s)

[CLI um and in all of these guys here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m11s)

[when you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m16s)

[run um a specific Target OS right you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m18s)

[get slightly different](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m22s)

[options like the windows pack command I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m26s)

[think is where we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m29s)

[actually doing some of this because this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m32s)

[will only end up being Windows](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m36s)

[specific even though pack has all of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m38s)

[this interesting stuff on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m41s)

[here I think we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m45s)

[needing to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m47s)

[this and I'm I'm trying I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m55s)

[just look and see what we already are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m57s)

[providing that we may end up right like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h47m59s)

[we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m02s)

[with I think in terms of what we need in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m07s)

[here right most of it we either already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m10s)

[have or can get because I am going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m13s)

[end up needing product name which I can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m17s)

[get from uh probably pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m20s)

[ID uh possibly title might be a better](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m25s)

[one here manufacture I think we're going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m29s)

[to just forward with authors because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m31s)

[that's likely the what you need to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m34s)

[version we've already](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m37s)

[got um language I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m39s)

[leave hardcoded Wix has a lot of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m42s)

[localization support that I don't think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m44s)

[we're going to worry](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m45s)

[about um the upgrade code is something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m46s)

[that we're going to need pass to us cuz](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m50s)

[I like that's not something that we can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m53s)

[generate like uh for a V1 we could](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m55s)

[generate it but then you need to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m58s)

[using the same upgrade code going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h48m59s)

[forward so I don't think we want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m03s)

[to do it and so I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m06s)

[wondering given](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m10s)

[that is like the release notes right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m12s)

[like those can all end up in markdown](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m16s)

[files that we then](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m19s)

[render I think we might have most of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m21s)

[what we need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m24s)

[here I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m26s)

[think obviously we'll need to have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m28s)

[program picker and all of that kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m31s)

[stuff flowing through but I I think we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m34s)

[can make this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m36s)

[work think we can make all of this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m40s)

[work I'm also mildly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m47s)

[tempted to write the UI in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m51s)

[avalonia I'm I'm mildly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m53s)

[tempted just not sure if it's actually a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h49m58s)

[worthwh Endeavor like this is going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m01s)

[be Windows specific so is there any](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m03s)

[benefit to it being avalonia versus](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m05s)

[might be better to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m07s)

[WPF I refuse to go Wind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m10s)

[forms because I'm gonna have to Target a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m13s)

[oh that's the other drawback is I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m16s)

[going to have to Target Yi oldi](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m17s)

[framework yeah yeah because I I'm kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m21s)

[of thinking that I take this file here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m23s)

[and just string template the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m26s)

[sucker](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m28s)

[and do all of that so let's do this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m30s)

[public uh goid my big head is in the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m34s)

[way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m39s)

[uh pretty close here here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m41s)

[co-pilot figure it out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m45s)

[Wix dang Nabb it dang NAB it co-pilot](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m47s)

[you're going to show off again aren't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m51s)

[you please don't make me look like an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m54s)

[idiot uh let's see so we are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h50m57s)

[only yeah and Izzy I've got good news in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m05s)

[terms of Delta updates got good](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m09s)

[news um we have right now the Delta](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m12s)

[updates on velop Pac](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m16s)

[like they they only go from version](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m19s)

[one to two two to three three to four](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m23s)

[right so they're additive and so if you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m26s)

[have somebody who needs to do a bunch of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m27s)

[updates Bop Pac will look and see if the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m29s)

[size of the Deltas is bigger than the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m32s)

[the this downloading the update itself](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m34s)

[and do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m36s)

[that um but we have a proof of concept](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m37s)

[of a really really slick way of doing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m43s)

[Deltas um you no longer need Delta files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m47s)

[that are separate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m51s)

[you get all the benefits of only](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m52s)

[downloading the changed bits that you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m54s)

[care about and it can go between any any](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m56s)

[two versions regardless of Channel](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h51m59s)

[version up down all of it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m02s)

[works when Kaylin told me that I was](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m06s)

[like that sounds like a pipe](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m08s)

[dream uh and then he proceeded to walk](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m10s)

[me through it and I went okay I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m13s)

[impressed uh I am very](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m15s)

[very co-pilot you are just freaking show](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m18s)

[off](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m22s)

[um that required I don't want it to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m25s)

[required I int like options are by](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m28s)

[definition](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m30s)

[optional um and I believe we want this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m38s)

[nullable uh for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m43s)

[wicks uh I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m50s)

[do like you need to know a little bit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m55s)

[um I don't know how I I I feel like I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h52m59s)

[have to do this with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m02s)

[documentation yeah and that's part this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m08s)

[is part of why I think I'm gonna we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m11s)

[going to get this working iszy and then](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m12s)

[I think I'm going to look](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m14s)

[into extensibility of it because it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m16s)

[would be really nice if cuz Wix you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m19s)

[separate things across multiple files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m22s)

[right and then it it kind of Globs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m25s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m27s)

[together in my mind what would be really](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m28s)

[clever is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m31s)

[if we just jened the one file but left](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m33s)

[it open for extensibility so that people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m37s)

[could bring in extra stuff but I need to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m39s)

[I need to look more into what that would](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m42s)

[actually look like because I I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m44s)

[really know what that would actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m47s)

[look like but I think that gives people](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m48s)

[then a really nice growup story](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m50s)

[um like I said one of my thoughts is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m54s)

[just like we could dump out this Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m57s)

[file for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h53m59s)

[somebody and go through and do it the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m01s)

[thing is some of the stuff is going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m03s)

[be conditional based upon the other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m04s)

[options you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m05s)

[set but my thought would be that if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m07s)

[people wanted that they could start with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m10s)

[that as a a Wix thing but ultimately you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m12s)

[can use velop pac's um library for the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m15s)

[updates and then roll your own installer](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m19s)

[like that's that's a thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m21s)

[the you can't do that today only because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m23s)

[the the update bootstrapper doesn't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m26s)

[handle the permissions problem once we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m28s)

[fix that then then you can roll you can](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m30s)

[effectively roll your own installer with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m34s)

[um our bootstrapper for updates and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m38s)

[you're you're good to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m40s)

[go um assuming the updates are an MSI](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m41s)

[file because at the end of the day our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m46s)

[bootstrapper still has to go out pull](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m48s)

[down do the run](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m50s)

[all that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m53s)

[stuff but there's there's very little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m55s)

[fanciness in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h54m58s)

[here um okay so if we do that we do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m00s)

[that what I want is then the pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m05s)

[Runner uh let's see Windows pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m10s)

[options this is where we need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m15s)

[public uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m19s)

[yeah and that's that's kind of what I've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m23s)

[seen](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m24s)

[the the visual studio extension that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m26s)

[they have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m29s)

[out strongly kind of guides you into a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m30s)

[particular structure for laying out the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m33s)

[files um which is which is totally fine](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m36s)

[right like I'm I'm cool with that but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m40s)

[then we have to figure out how how do we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m42s)

[plug in things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m45s)

[properly yeah one or more files for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m48s)

[localization exactly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m50s)

[so I'm looking to get V1 in and working](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m53s)

[and then we'll add the extensibility](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m56s)

[later that's kind of my thought](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h55m59s)

[initially is I want to get a basic W uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m01s)

[MSI generating and deal with the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m05s)

[bootstrapper and make sure all of that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m07s)

[plays nice and then it will'll Circle](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m08s)

[back to make this thing better kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m11s)

[my thinking that's that's where my](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m14s)

[head's at at the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m16s)

[moment uh okay so now in the command](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m18s)

[Runner](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m21s)

[this is where we end up doing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m23s)

[stuffs right so we do click once](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m25s)

[manifest blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m28s)

[update](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m32s)

[uh why does this thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m35s)

[doce edit resource](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m42s)

[edit feel like some of these things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m45s)

[should be asynchronous calls that aren't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m47s)

[but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m49s)

[whatever um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m50s)

[clean this up while I'm here collection](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m54s)

[initializer that's the new](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h56m58s)

[hotness uh assume you're going with Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m03s)

[4 uh I might even go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m06s)

[five I might even go](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m09s)

[five but our we've already got code in](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m12s)

[here that can pull down nougat](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m16s)

[packages um because we needed to pull](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m18s)

[them down for for Azure trusted](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m21s)

[signing um but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m26s)

[the my thought was a global](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m29s)

[Tool uh is just a nougat package and so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m34s)

[I I may leverage that same code for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m37s)

[pulling](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m39s)

[down um that in order to to do it bellac](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m42s)

[already has um a requirement that to run](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m46s)

[its tooling you need net like that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m50s)

[currently a built-in requirement at some](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m53s)

[point we may look to relax that um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m55s)

[because for non. net devs that's an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h57m57s)

[extra ad they don't normally](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m00s)

[have uh yeah well and the thing is at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m03s)

[present I haven't done anything that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m06s)

[Wix 5 specific I don't think I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m08s)

[think I think the big jump that they did](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m11s)

[because I was going through the changes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m15s)

[is from 3: to 4 there was a huge amount](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m17s)

[of cleanup where they got rid of of a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m20s)

[lot of dup because before in Wix 3 which](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m22s)

[I I had used before there was a lot of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m25s)

[duplicate stuff right like you had a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m26s)

[goid and you had to make sure you put it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m28s)

[in all three places correctly or your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m30s)

[world](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m32s)

[ended and in four they kind of realized](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m33s)

[okay let's let's dial that back and make](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m36s)

[it easier for people and then they did](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m39s)

[more in five I think as I understood the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m41s)

[release notes but I have not dug into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m43s)

[it yeah and that's the thing is I I I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m49s)

[think if I want broad support four is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m52s)

[the way to go because there is a large](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m55s)

[amount of stuff](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h58m59s)

[there they just broke it in other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m01s)

[ways yeah like Wix is powerful but it is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m06s)

[also it it annoys me when I use](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m10s)

[it um which is not which is not a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m14s)

[feeling you want to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m17s)

[have uh let's see this this is all of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m20s)

[the stuff but where](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m22s)

[is where's the actual oh was I down a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m24s)

[level that what's going on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m29s)

[here yeah that's exactly what's going on](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m32s)

[here okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m35s)

[so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m38s)

[executable yeah package](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m41s)

[Builder this is where I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m44s)

[figure out the right place to plug this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m47s)

[in at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m49s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m52s)

[see only on Linux setup](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m54s)

[task with great power comes a greater](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=01h59m58s)

[chance to shoot yourself in the foot and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m00s)

[make a bigger hole while doing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m03s)

[it um what are you squawking about](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m05s)

[here variable declaration can be Decon](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m08s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m11s)

[clever](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m13s)

[deconstruct I like it we're going to use](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m16s)

[a value tup we might as well go all the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m19s)

[way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m21s)

[yeah because this is kind of what I'm](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m24s)

[thinking where we write out new spec](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m26s)

[stuff and that kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m27s)

[thing but where is the right place to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h00m29s)

[MSI either so create setup package is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h01m39s)

[the stuff](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h01m57s)

[apart because at this point do we have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h01m59s)

[all the information we do I think we do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m02s)

[a got the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m08s)

[check everything we need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m13s)

[this end up working just checks it I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m45s)

[think we would actually probably want to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m48s)

[go in here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m50s)

[something along the lines of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m52s)

[if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m55s)

[options. Wix upgrade code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h02m57s)

[is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m01s)

[right um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m04s)

[no uh let's see Quicks upgrade](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m06s)

[code uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m10s)

[specified creting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m15s)

[MSI right so something something of that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m18s)

[nature](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m21s)

[let's see here set up exe change](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m25s)

[extension MSI okay copal you want to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m28s)

[just write the code for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m31s)

[me cre MSI from setup see I don't think](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m33s)

[that's quite what I want to do here I I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m37s)

[appreciate I appreciate you doing that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m42s)

[but let's look here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m44s)

[because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m46s)

[uh let's see do you use a package or](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m48s)

[just XML te to create the Wix types](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m50s)

[where you hand crafting from](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m53s)

[scratch uh and I previously used X code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m55s)

[to generate types when I automated the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h03m59s)

[thing in the last place oh um I was I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m01s)

[was going real dumb because you are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m04s)

[correct they do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m06s)

[have um the the scheme out there I also](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m08s)

[looked at there's uh like a wixn net](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m13s)

[library that was sitting out there that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m16s)

[seemed to be uh reasonably supported for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m19s)

[Jenning installers with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m23s)

[c um I was thinking of going a little](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m24s)

[lower to the ground and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m27s)

[just uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m30s)

[uh Jenning the XML and then actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m33s)

[using the Wix CLI to build the MSI from](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m37s)

[that so having our tooling effectively](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m40s)

[gen this file and then just use their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m43s)

[Global tool to create it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m47s)

[because I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m52s)

[think I have all of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m54s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h04m57s)

[um the problem is this isn't quite right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m00s)

[because this is the package path the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m03s)

[package path in this case is the new get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m05s)

[package um I think this is what I want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m08s)

[though I want this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m12s)

[guy if I've](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m15s)

[got oh this is probably a mistake](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m17s)

[wait isn't zip package](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m22s)

[disposable OH ZIP package is ours ah it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m27s)

[wraps it that's why okay okay oh that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m32s)

[interesting if this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m37s)

[ours that means it's got all the files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m39s)

[for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m42s)

[me well that's exactly what I'd](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m43s)

[like that is 100% what I want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m46s)

[though I kind of would like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m52s)

[the cuz I'm going to want the individual](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h05m59s)

[files before their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m02s)

[package not after](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m05s)

[that's that's going to be an interesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m09s)

[problem so we don't actually have the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m11s)

[original](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m13s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m14s)

[here where release](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m17s)

[path building](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m23s)

[release uh create release package so I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m26s)

[actually want the pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m29s)

[directory is this is what actually has](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m31s)

[all of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m34s)

[files right because this creates a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m37s)

[subdirectory of lib app copies the files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m39s)

[into it this has the sum total of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m42s)

[everything that I'm looking to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m45s)

[get but I need to package all of those](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m48s)

[up I actually need the pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m52s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h06m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m00s)

[I kind of think we might want to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m03s)

[something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m06s)

[here though I'm also realiz](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m20s)

[well the only reason to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m24s)

[not uh go here is because this guy](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m27s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m30s)

[have I guess he does have the Pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m32s)

[direct does have the Pack directory so I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m35s)

[do I do have access what I want it's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m38s)

[just it's just not quite in the form I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m44s)

[would like it but I do have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m47s)

[it so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m49s)

[um those](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m52s)

[Runner uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m55s)

[see and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h07m57s)

[options. uh where is it oh the the base](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m00s)

[class for tar picking the target](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m04s)

[OS Target](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m10s)

[OS think we want](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m12s)

[to think we want to do something like](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m14s)

[this so uh if Target not equal to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m17s)

[Windows because we aren't going to allow](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m22s)

[this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m24s)

[anywhere right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m25s)

[uh I think we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m39s)

[like this you up bring you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m41s)

[down else something of this nature I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m44s)

[think right and so this is going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m49s)

[to don't really want it to be setup](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m52s)

[bundle like I I I think we probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h08m54s)

[dollar create](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m01s)

[upgrade code and we know we are going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m08s)

[need the pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m10s)

[directory that that has the code that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m12s)

[has all the stuff we're probably going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m15s)

[to need to pass through options as well](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m17s)

[I imagine I can't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m20s)

[can't see how we wouldn't pass I guess](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m22s)

[rather than update code what we really](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m25s)

[can just pass is options](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m27s)

[then right because that's that's going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m29s)

[to have all of the things that we need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h09m31s)

[oh cancel apparently I left it sitting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m36s)

[too long and it timed out okay uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m40s)

[see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m43s)

[authors um and this may be interesting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m46s)

[because authors is multiple so that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m49s)

[might get that might get to be a weird](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m51s)

[situation](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m54s)

[but options Wicks upgrade](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m56s)

[code go there do there do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h12m59s)

[there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m03s)

[um think we end up doing the same thing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m06s)

[here right of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m21s)

[um okay then this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m27s)

[becomes where things might get real](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m34s)

[interesting because how do we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m36s)

[gen these goids especially for updates](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m40s)

[for now we're just going to do goid new](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m44s)

[goid but I I think we have to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m47s)

[different than that and more importantly](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m52s)

[I think we need to iterate through each](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m54s)

[of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m56s)

[these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h13m58s)

[so that we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m01s)

[change opponent main](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m05s)

[executable uh and then I think we need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m09s)

[to bring so we're going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m11s)

[the the custom UI for the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m13s)

[moment I don't know how we're going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m16s)

[to how we're to deal with that quite yet](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m19s)

[we're going to get rid of the binary](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m23s)

[read me for the moment we're just going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m24s)

[to get this thing again appropriately](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m26s)

[the right](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m28s)

[files let's start with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m29s)

[that that'll be that'll be a win in and](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m32s)

[of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m35s)

[itself so I believe if I remember](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m36s)

[correctly the component if I just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m41s)

[iterate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m43s)

[through](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m47s)

[um passing install location](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m48s)

[right this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h14m51s)

[is yeah so I think what we'll end up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m04s)

[doing is Jenning out](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m06s)

[okay I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m21s)

[remember uh Wix](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m24s)

[installer uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m27s)

[file or if](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m38s)

[it's Atomic units of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m40s)

[installation I think we put uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m55s)

[installer](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m57s)

[all files go in a single component](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h15m59s)

[because I think in our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m03s)

[case single file per component show me](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m07s)

[your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m10s)

[Source there we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m13s)

[go see this is the problem](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m18s)

[which SCT yourself to a single file for](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m24s)

[a component is designed to support](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m26s)

[thousands of components of single](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m27s)

[Stellar every component must have its](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m29s)

[own unique guid failure to follow these](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m32s)

[two basic rules can lead to many](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m34s)

[problems blah blah blah yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m35s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m38s)

[so this is where it's going to get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m40s)

[and this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h16m57s)

[to actually harvest the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h17m09s)

[our life a little bit](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h17m16s)

[easier uh let's see](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h17m18s)

[where is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h17m36s)

[end up with a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h18m15s)

[of what I'm thinking this is kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m32s)

[what I'm thinking problem is is this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m34s)

[assumes](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m37s)

[a looks tool set SDK I'm kind](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m43s)

[of trying to avoid going down that route](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m47s)

[if I can help](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m50s)

[it but I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m52s)

[if without it I would be forced to gen](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m55s)

[it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h19m58s)

[myself because it knows how to pull](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m04s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m06s)

[across](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m10s)

[harvested the end of the day it really](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m12s)

[is just something akin to this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m15s)

[oh you can goo it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m28s)

[star](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m31s)

[what](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m33s)

[I'm I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m35s)

[am clearly out of my element here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m37s)

[uh it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h20m57s)

[this then](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m02s)

[component](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m05s)

[group but I think what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m07s)

[we want I think we just want to rip](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m09s)

[through this thing and J it up](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m11s)

[I think that's how we want to do this I](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m21s)

[think that's how we want to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m23s)

[this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m27s)

[um ignoring where this has to go if we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m30s)

[can assume that the working directory is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m33s)

[inside the pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m35s)

[directory then just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m37s)

[grab options there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m40s)

[so uh let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m45s)

[do do something like private static](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m48s)

[I file](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m53s)

[info pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h21m58s)

[files I think the the other bit of code](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m00s)

[that we were looking at that runs that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m04s)

[rips through here this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m07s)

[package um it literally just grabs](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m10s)

[everything from the package directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m13s)

[copies it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m17s)

[in I don't know that there's any](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m18s)

[limiting factors](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m20s)

[here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m22s)

[um yeah I think this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m34s)

[is exactly what we want we also probably](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m37s)

[want to check not](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m40s)

[just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m44s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m49s)

[but we want to make sure that we're](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m53s)

[targeting windows and that we are](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m54s)

[running on Windows I don't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m56s)

[think I don't think we can do this cross](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h22m58s)

[plat any other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m01s)

[way might check we might be able to J](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m03s)

[outside of window might not have to be](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m06s)

[on window we're targeting](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m08s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m10s)

[okay copy files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m16s)

[internal reject excludes see this is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m18s)

[what I was wondering is is there an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m21s)

[exclude a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m23s)

[bit uh okay](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m27s)

[so package](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m30s)

[Builder because match exclude pattern](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m41s)

[blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m44s)

[blah kind of want to expose some of this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m47s)

[this logic so that I can leverage](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m50s)

[it this enumerates](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m54s)

[files calls this copy files internal you](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h23m58s)

[do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m02s)

[um I don't want to have](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m03s)

[something that does this is source is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m07s)

[just coming in here this should actually](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m12s)

[probably be enumerate](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m15s)

[files um which is slightly faster than](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m18s)

[get files because get files has to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m22s)

[create up an array it it's shouldn't](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m23s)

[make a big difference overall because at](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m26s)

[the end of the day we have to get](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m28s)

[through them all but it allows the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m29s)

[enumerator to start running](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m32s)

[quickly uh exclude](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m35s)

[annoyances love the variable](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m38s)

[name your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m42s)

[parameter the other](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m44s)

[one glute annoyance is false](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m47s)

[so it's coming](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m51s)

[in it's coming in with false on the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h24m56s)

[other one so we can probably just rip](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m00s)

[through the directory then because](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m03s)

[there's nothing fancy about any of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m04s)

[this literally is just that so let's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m07s)

[let's start](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m11s)

[there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m12s)

[um so if we come up here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m16s)

[uh we are going to need](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m21s)

[a directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m24s)

[info back](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m29s)

[directory this thing's called Source but](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m32s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m35s)

[fine um and I believe that there](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m36s)

[Works numerate files Returns the file](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m40s)

[you typ so if we get back this](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m46s)

[that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m51s)

[means on our](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h25m52s)

[getent file info](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m16s)

[um I kind of want to strip the name a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m25s)

[little bit so that it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m27s)

[doesn't like file full name isn't going](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m32s)

[to be what we actually want because that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m35s)

[includes the directory on there name is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m36s)

[actually closer to what we need but we](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m40s)

[we kind of want to get relative](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m42s)

[path um](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m45s)

[there there could be multiple files](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m50s)

[uh hey no problem uh so that is a great](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h26m57s)

[question so what we are currently](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m02s)

[working on at the moment](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m03s)

[is uh this issue here for a library](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m05s)

[called uh velop](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m09s)

[Pac the the idea is we would like to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m11s)

[generate an MSI](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m13s)

[installer uh as an option for people who](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m15s)

[use velop pack to to install their](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m19s)

[applications so velop Pac is a](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m21s)

[crossplatform uh installer up uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m23s)

[installer tool set and updator Library](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m27s)

[all kind of packaged into one that way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m31s)

[you can have easy updates uh I'm doing](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m33s)

[stuff in C but it supports C C++ rust](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m36s)

[JavaScript believe at the moment with](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m40s)

[more on the way](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m42s)

[um and so as part of this it is designed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m46s)

[to be quick and easy and fast but uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m50s)

[there are cases where because it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m54s)

[currently installs in Local app data uh](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h27m57s)

[it installs per user rather than once](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m00s)

[for the whole application so part of the](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m03s)

[motivation here is to allow an](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m05s)

[optional installer to generate an MSI as](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m09s)

[well that way if people want to install](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m11s)

[into say program files and do it once](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m14s)

[per machine or use an MSI as part of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m16s)

[some automation or group policy or](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m20s)

[whatnot um there's an easy one up so](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m22s)

[that's that's the intent is we're just](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m26s)

[trying to get a very simplistic MSI](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m28s)

[generated from a velop Pac pack](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m32s)

[directory the velop PAC pack directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m35s)

[is functionally the output directory](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m38s)

[from running something like dnip](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m40s)

[generally that's what you're going to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m42s)

[pointed at you publish your app into](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m44s)

[whatever whatever directory makes sense](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m46s)

[for your app appli so in C uh the net](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m49s)

[publish gives you your nice release](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m52s)

[build with whether you're going to do](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m54s)

[trimming whether you're going to bring](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m58s)

[in the the framework uh alongside of it](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h28m59s)

[or whether you're going to assume that](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m03s)

[it's all ahead of time all that kind of](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m04s)

[jet so those are all options available](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m07s)

[to velop act does also support](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m10s)

[installing The NET Framework if your app](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m13s)

[needs it that is an option available to](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m15s)

[you so when you're considering your](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m18s)

[packaging just keep that in mind I am](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m21s)

[also realizing my indentation here is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m24s)

[crap and that should look a little more](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m27s)

[actually I think that's correct that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m30s)

[the one that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m33s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m38s)

[think that is how it's supposed](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m39s)

[toed that's](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m42s)

[what okay so but what I need to do here](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m45s)

[is](https://youtu.be/OgqrfA8BvrE?t=02h29m49s)
