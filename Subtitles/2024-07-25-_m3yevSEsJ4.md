[hello everyone welcome back my apologies](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m02s)

[to anyone who caught my little stream](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m04s)

[flub earlier a few minutes ago so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m05s)

[is the real one huzzah we are live and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m08s)

[things are happy and exciting so uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m11s)

[tonight I am joined by my good pal Casey](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m13s)

[hang on Casey](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m16s)

[welcome howdy how you doing Kev good uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m18s)

[Casey is uh one of my colleagues from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m22s)

[intellitech uh he won't admit to it but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m25s)

[he is an AI expert uh he is also a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m27s)

[Mountain Dew connoisseur so we have two](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m30s)

[things that we both](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m32s)

[enjoy they now have it in zero sugar](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m34s)

[it's amazing I know that de defeats the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m37s)

[purpose for some but for for some of us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m40s)

[it does definitely defeat the purpose uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m42s)

[but tonight we are going to be playing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m44s)

[around a little bit on sprinkling some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m46s)

[AI magic in uh with some of the stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m48s)

[that I do with the streaming uh partly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m51s)

[for Learning and partly because AI is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m53s)

[cool and partly to make me slightly more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h00m56s)

[efficient one cool little link that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m00s)

[wanted to share this was something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m02s)

[another colleague put out the other day](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m04s)

[and I completely missed it if you are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m07s)

[interested in learning concurrency and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m10s)

[fun coding problems this is a pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m13s)

[cool thing this is really slick so check](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m15s)

[it out um I contemplated actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m20s)

[working through it on stream at some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m22s)

[point as well so if people would find](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m24s)

[that interesting um like concurrency and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m26s)

[Deadlocks are always an interesting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m30s)

[thing and the bane of some people's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m31s)

[existence so there's that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m34s)

[okay Casey YouTube subtitles what are we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m37s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m41s)

[tonight so yeah yeah I think I think we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m42s)

[know what we're doing um so I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m46s)

[we're going to start out uh getting some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m48s)

[semantic memory uh going this will be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m51s)

[done with the kernel memory framework um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m54s)

[for Microsoft open source pretty cool uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h01m58s)

[done by some of their um developers that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m02s)

[also worked](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m05s)

[on uh semantic kernel and uh provides a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m06s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m11s)

[little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m13s)

[um it's best way to put this uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m15s)

[ingestion um flow so it provides well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m18s)

[not just ingestion but also outflow I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m22s)

[guess uh it has pictures it provides](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m24s)

[your memory for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m26s)

[rag uh yeah so it's used to take in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m28s)

[documents or it provides a service that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m31s)

[allows you to enter in whatever data you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m33s)

[want to be part of your rag application](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m36s)

[uh you build out ingestion pipelines for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m39s)

[those um and this allows it to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m42s)

[containerized and also scale uh which is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m44s)

[pretty cool and on the other side of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m47s)

[that you can also connect to it to get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m50s)

[your actual semantic memories so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m52s)

[providing a query and receiving back not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m54s)

[just your information but also um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m57s)

[sources and such uh it's kind of a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h02m59s)

[little bit more well thought out than uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m02s)

[sman kernel was um from the memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m04s)

[perspective um and it's focused on being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m07s)

[a a service so you could also put a I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m10s)

[know you're going to hate this but you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m14s)

[could put any front end on this uh it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m16s)

[doesn't have to be uh as long as any](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m17s)

[front end is WPF I'm good with that or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m19s)

[yeah yeah so um you know you can put a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m22s)

[python front end on this which feels](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m25s)

[backwards but it's possible um so it's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m27s)

[it's pretty cool Library um little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m30s)

[framework here so we'll start by taking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m32s)

[a look there and hopefully set up a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m35s)

[ingestion pipeline for your subtitles](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m39s)

[cool so just to clarify so uh what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m43s)

[listening to you talk I have a feeling](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m46s)

[this is what my wife feels like when I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m48s)

[talk about my work is lots of words that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m49s)

[like are clearly English yeah that don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m53s)

[make a lot of sense so for people who](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m57s)

[may feel a little lost rag is retrieval](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h03m58s)

[augmented Generation Um this is often](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m00s)

[times if you imagine like chat GPT and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m03s)

[saying Hey I want chat GPT but I want it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m07s)

[to be on my data I I want to have it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m10s)

[have knowledge of stuff so again](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m13s)

[retrieval pulling the data back](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m17s)

[augmented generation the that would be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m18s)

[the the AI bit part of it and then the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m21s)

[generation is saying okay now create a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m24s)

[response using what you've got to to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m26s)

[answer back that's exactly it and theef](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m30s)

[of that you you do and the biggest](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m35s)

[benefits to that really is um uh twofold](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m37s)

[in my opinion one is grounding um so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m40s)

[you're able to prevent uh hallucinations](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m44s)

[um by providing additional context](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m47s)

[that's related to the query so um this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m49s)

[can be just other facts that you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m52s)

[that um that just help the llm really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m54s)

[know what you mean um from context](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h04m57s)

[perspective uh the other piece there is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m00s)

[although it's not as much of a problem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m03s)

[now since um there's been so many](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m04s)

[updates in the training data or the data](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m07s)

[that the uh llms are trade on now um but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m08s)

[previously it was a big benefit because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m12s)

[you were able to provide um more recent](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m13s)

[data um things that were past the end of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m17s)

[the training uh training library or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m20s)

[training Corpus date um into the llm so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m23s)

[it had additional knowledge beyond what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m26s)

[it was trained on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m28s)

[right cool so I have the this little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m30s)

[YouTube subtitles library that is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m34s)

[sitting here one moment I'm dealing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m36s)

[with there we go um this repo that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m43s)

[have here is one that I've showed people](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m47s)

[on stream a couple times the key thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m49s)

[here is this little subtitles folder has](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m51s)

[a bunch of markdown files and these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m54s)

[markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m56s)

[files are filled with with text and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h05m58s)

[hyperlinks that link out to my videos at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m01s)

[that particular point and the whole](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m04s)

[reason I built this is so that I could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m06s)

[come in here and say well what have I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m07s)

[said about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m09s)

[WPF and then I can literally scroll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m10s)

[through the hits on my markdown ignoring](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m12s)

[the C ones um find the things that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m14s)

[want and then say well let's actually go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m17s)

[and look at that particular thing now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m22s)

[some of these things are more well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m25s)

[formatted than others you can see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m26s)

[there's there's like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m28s)

[the uh the raw version of this right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m30s)

[there was times where I had my spacing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m34s)

[weird and things were off but you know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m36s)

[what it's gotten better over time and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m38s)

[this autog generates now with dates and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m41s)

[so I can go and look back at all the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m44s)

[stuff and it gives me a nice easy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m46s)

[retrieval but it also means I've got a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m48s)

[corpus of data and I want to feed that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m50s)

[data into an AI and multiply little AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m55s)

[version of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h06m59s)

[me it's like Skynet only bad](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m00s)

[mode that's the way I'm thinking of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m06s)

[this I I like it I'm a little further](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m09s)

[off i' probably call it more of a Kevin](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m11s)

[bot it's definitely not it's definitely](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m14s)

[not you you'll have more knowledge than](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m17s)

[the sayi does so I've got so I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m19s)

[clown this so I've cloned the repo](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m23s)

[preemptively um I have a handful of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m26s)

[projects in here we probably don't care](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m29s)

[about any of these at the moment not yet](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m32s)

[not yet we'll get there okay where where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m35s)

[do you want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m37s)

[start you get you get to I I'm just a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m39s)

[co-pilot who's gonna ask dumb questions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m41s)

[along the way get it co-pilot yep I love](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m43s)

[it that's my idea of an AI I don't even](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m47s)

[have to type you know that's what I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m50s)

[really want the AI for I don't want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m52s)

[type anymore I know that seems crazy as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m54s)

[a programmer but we'll get there um so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h07m56s)

[let's start by kind of talking about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m00s)

[some of the options we have here um kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m02s)

[of architecture overall and uh we may](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m05s)

[actually start outside of code and take](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m08s)

[a look at some Azure stuff so okay um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m11s)

[guide me oh great Sensei absolutely so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m14s)

[if you scroll down just a little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m17s)

[you'll see uh server list so synchronous](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m19s)

[memory API um so there are really and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m23s)

[may have undersold this there are really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m27s)

[two ways to run uh kernel memory and it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m28s)

[Beyond being a a framework and um a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m32s)

[library that you can actually pull in it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m36s)

[is fairly self-sufficient uh as is as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m38s)

[well um and it can run in two modes uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m41s)

[first you can run it um like serverless](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m44s)

[so that allows you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m47s)

[to have it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m49s)

[um uh provide synchronous and um be used](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m52s)

[as part of a like pipeline um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h08m56s)

[and the other option is to run it async](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m00s)

[um and you can run it in containers to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m04s)

[have it auto scale as you need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m07s)

[more queries to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m12s)

[answered](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m14s)

[okay so uh the first decision would be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m16s)

[do we run want to run this as a separate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m20s)

[service um to not only fill up the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m22s)

[document storage but then also allow for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m25s)

[a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m28s)

[um uh service to respond to queries to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m31s)

[theal memory I think we want to run this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m35s)

[as part of the pipeline yeah I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m38s)

[think I don't know if I would put those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m42s)

[as mutually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m45s)

[exclusive unless I have to oh absolutely](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m46s)

[because my my thought](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m50s)

[is if I can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m54s)

[build the functions for this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h09m56s)

[putting it because running the in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m00s)

[pipeline means I slap a little CLI front](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m02s)

[end on on the front of this and away we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m04s)

[go and putting it up as like a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m07s)

[containerized service is I put a web API](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m10s)

[in front of it and I call it a day the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m12s)

[web API gets a little more interesting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m15s)

[because I kind of don't want to just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m17s)

[leave it completely unauthenticated and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m18s)

[so I have to put something in front of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m20s)

[that so I'm somewhat tempted to to lean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m23s)

[the other way first because then it is a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m27s)

[little less ripe for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m30s)

[abuse currently but at the point where I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m32s)

[get a you know a pretty you know WPF app](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m35s)

[in front of this then I think we do put](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m38s)

[the the API](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m41s)

[there okay do that does that change your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m42s)

[thinking at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m46s)

[all because I am I am sorry I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m48s)

[wondering is this sort of what you were](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m51s)

[talking about with the open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m53s)

[AI yeah Colonel memory server sounds](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h10m56s)

[absolutely nuts in the chat I don't know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m00s)

[if you're watching](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m01s)

[it no um I am not actually watching the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m03s)

[chat give me one second let me pull that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m07s)

[up I always forget because I don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m09s)

[stream what can I say um I gotta watch](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m11s)

[them all yeah because we could go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m14s)

[with like I know this is showing with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m19s)

[open AI but I do like I think I have an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m22s)

[Azure AI instance up yeah no this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m26s)

[this has Azure open AI uh compatibility](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m29s)

[buil in yeah we're fine there it really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m32s)

[comes down to if we want it to be if we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m36s)

[want this to be long](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m38s)

[lived or if we want it to only](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m40s)

[be for now the pipel for okay you run it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m43s)

[as part of the pipeline as a container](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m49s)

[in there or you run it as a service](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m51s)

[externally and then you call into it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m54s)

[from your pipeline right but the service](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m56s)

[could still be transient as long as the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h11m59s)

[data store was persistent is that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m02s)

[correct that is correct yeah we'll still](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m04s)

[need a persistent data store at the on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m07s)

[the back end of that um and that will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m09s)

[include not just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m11s)

[um a vector database but also some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m14s)

[document storage as you'll see there um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m17s)

[because it keeps track of you know a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m19s)

[while back we talked about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m24s)

[um we talked about doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m26s)

[uh sourcing um so having uh not just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m31s)

[your memories but also being able to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m35s)

[Source back and um being able to track](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m37s)

[changes in the incoming data so if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m40s)

[were to upload um two of the same](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m42s)

[documents if that document changed it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m45s)

[would be able to pick up those changes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m47s)

[yeah so this has all of that built](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m49s)

[in we just need to configure it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m53s)

[correctly fine web API it is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m55s)

[all right you want me to spin a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h12m59s)

[project](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m02s)

[um yeah let's spin a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m04s)

[project I'm going back and looking at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m07s)

[some of my previous work against doing a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m10s)

[basic web API](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m13s)

[this uh yes I think that should cover us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m15s)

[that is not that is not how you do a web](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m19s)

[API that is how you spin a net Aspire](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m21s)

[host which might I add is just frankly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m23s)

[amazing um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m27s)

[yeah let's get out of here and we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m35s)

[going to go let's put it in a different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m37s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m40s)

[um well let's I'm going to just I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m41s)

[I'm going to keep it in my same solution](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m44s)

[and I'm just going to go all wrong and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m46s)

[put it in a directory that's parallel my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m48s)

[solution rather than underneath it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m50s)

[because why not absolutely um before you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m53s)

[go too far let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h13m57s)

[what are you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m01s)

[thinking do you know me I'm going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m02s)

[type if left to my own devices oh I know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m04s)

[that's the problem I'm almost thinking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m08s)

[it might be worth](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m12s)

[just okay yeah spin up spin up a WP WP](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m17s)

[next I heard net 8 uh do I need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m22s)

[container support N I roll my own uh do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m26s)

[not use top level statements use](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m29s)

[controllers we care about controllers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m30s)

[versus minimal](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m32s)

[apis uh I prefer controllers but it it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m34s)

[shouldn't really matter now minimal apis](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m38s)

[it is yay yeah I knew that was coming](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m41s)

[you and minimal API you said I didn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m44s)

[care it's the last thing that I heard I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m46s)

[know it's my mistake what can I say look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m48s)

[done I have API I win as long as all I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m52s)

[need the API to do is return weather](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m56s)

[forecast from a random ly generated list](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h14m58s)

[we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m00s)

[good there you go for man's AI for man's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m01s)

[AI I don't understand this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m05s)

[next like I don't like like why wh why](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m08s)

[rainbow or random I thought that said](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m13s)

[rainbow for a second I was like what and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m15s)

[the thing is is this just generates the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m18s)

[next value and then throws it away yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m20s)

[does a date time does nothing with it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m23s)

[throws it away oh wait hang on these are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m26s)

[going into this is a Constructor never](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m28s)

[mind it's not being thrown away so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m30s)

[is just generating temps okay I see I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m31s)

[understand now okay this is generating a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m34s)

[date setting the temperature in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m37s)

[summer okay okay learn to read got it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m38s)

[got it got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m41s)

[it uh it's been a while since I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m42s)

[looked at the uh the default API that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m45s)

[comes out of nor normally I new API](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m48s)

[project yeah normally I lead with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m50s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m51s)

[this um and then it just goes away but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m53s)

[you know that's me Fair](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m56s)

[but we can just code it straight and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h15m59s)

[then I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m01s)

[can interesting I'm surprised this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m04s)

[weird I'll have to look at this newer](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m07s)

[one okay now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m10s)

[what I have created an API I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m13s)

[reached the end of my area of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m16s)

[expertise uh let's go grab let's go grab](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m19s)

[the Cel memory um why know get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m23s)

[link oh okay so let's go here uh manage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m27s)

[net](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m30s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m32s)

[browse colel memory and it's oh it's not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m34s)

[in pre-release wow I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m39s)

[have lots of choices would you like to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m43s)

[narrow down when you said grab the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m45s)

[kernel memory one to something slightly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m47s)

[smaller uh service asp.net core that guy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m49s)

[yep that one and we'll come back and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m55s)

[grab a few more uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h16m57s)

[uh again I I think we we talked a little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m00s)

[bit about where you want to store your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m03s)

[stuff so we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m05s)

[determine storage location because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m07s)

[they've got as you can see on the screen](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m09s)

[right now um Azure blobs for uh data](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m11s)

[storage if you want to use that um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m14s)

[they've got that that so interface](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m18s)

[already built in yeah which kind of like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m20s)

[I get some of those but like why would I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m24s)

[ever pick Azure blobs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m26s)

[or in this case I guess document storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m30s)

[versus a database because I I picture](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m32s)

[blobs as like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m34s)

[unstructured](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m36s)

[so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m38s)

[and I'm not going to tell you you can't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m40s)

[but uh the way that it works by default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m43s)

[is it uses uh a folder structure and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m46s)

[actual text files as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m51s)

[it's uh like version history um version](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m53s)

[retention and so that's what actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m57s)

[gets stored in there your vectors don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h17m59s)

[um it's not it's not like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m01s)

[uh uh SQL light for vectors got it well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m03s)

[I I was goingon to say I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m09s)

[just okay totally](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m10s)

[understand play right for kernel](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m14s)

[memory sorry I'm just putting this on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m20s)

[the side this is my read later thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m22s)

[because one those two things together](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m24s)

[sounds absolutely amazing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m27s)

[um and I'm terrified what would you use](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m29s)

[it for tell me all about it I mean mying](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m32s)

[the web well my default setting is if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m35s)

[the AI can do my UI test for me that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m38s)

[sounds really cool like it feels like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m40s)

[what cucumber test wanted to be right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m43s)

[where I write natural language and test](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m46s)

[occurs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m50s)

[like okay you're thinking at it from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m52s)

[that perspective yeah interesting I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m54s)

[thought you were talking about like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m57s)

[it just determining how to do tests oh I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h18m59s)

[was like I don't know if we're there yet](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m03s)

[or what test should be done but it would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m06s)

[be nice to have a test where it's like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m08s)

[hey I go to GitHub I click the login](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m09s)

[button I type in this username and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m11s)

[password and then have and say and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m13s)

[go yeah that would be nice it uh it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m17s)

[definitely reduces the typing a bit yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m21s)

[which I guess what I was all about so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m24s)

[yeah so we might want to do um Azure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m26s)

[portal stuff right is what we're saying](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m30s)

[I think so I think that's where we're at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m32s)

[so okay before we go too much F farther](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m34s)

[we were G to talk about architecture and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m37s)

[then we talked a little bit about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m38s)

[architecture and fell right back into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m39s)

[code happens every time I know see ah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m41s)

[I'm bad at this okay so here we go sorry](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m45s)

[I had to I had to kind of switch gears a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m48s)

[little bit and make sure I was in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m50s)

[right place so totally understand we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m51s)

[going to call we're going to do a resour](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m53s)

[group kaboo bot I don't know if you care](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m56s)

[where I put it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m57s)

[I mean we're in the west coast so I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h19m59s)

[prefer the West Coast but I don't know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m01s)

[where your viewership is I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m02s)

[mean the this is this is one of those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m05s)

[things that needs to be great for all of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m07s)

[the users of this which roughly equate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m10s)

[to me me me me me and I checked with all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m12s)

[of my uh stakeholders which are me and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m15s)

[they said that the West us all thumbs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m18s)

[up sounds good to me okay so you want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m21s)

[post](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m24s)

[yeah I would say we should go with post](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m26s)

[post um the nice thing with postgress is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m28s)

[that you really don't you don't need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m31s)

[anything else until you actually get to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m33s)

[large](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m35s)

[scale postest is super flexible with all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m37s)

[the extensions and everything I mean the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m40s)

[what we're going to use it for now um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m43s)

[obviously a PG Vector so Vector database](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m45s)

[but it can also do time series um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m48s)

[basically anything that that you could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m52s)

[want to do with a with a normal or most](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m53s)

[specialized databases the only exception](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m56s)

[or the biggest exception in my head is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h20m59s)

[uh graph DB right now but give it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m02s)

[another year and I'll bet you'll have an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m05s)

[extension for it perfect so as your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m06s)

[database yeah this one here you can do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m09s)

[that or there's also flexible servers um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m12s)

[I don't know if that's under there or if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m15s)

[it's separate on H this page it's been a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m17s)

[while since I've I saw it show up when I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m19s)

[did this so I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m22s)

[assuming um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m24s)

[you want to give me a rough breakdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m29s)

[what's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m30s)

[difference is flexible more like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m31s)

[flexible is more like a DTU type spend](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m34s)

[if I'm not mistaken and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m37s)

[um uh the other one is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m40s)

[dedicated got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m43s)

[it I heard flexible that's probably good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m44s)

[for us right now yeah uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m48s)

[server](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m51s)

[name why do you want to be in the East](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m54s)

[US](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m57s)

[I know uh oh I'm not allowed to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h21m59s)

[provision there I might have to go East](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m01s)

[us for my oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m03s)

[wow I'm not allowed to provision in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m07s)

[East us where am I allowed to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m09s)

[provision okay we're good that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m13s)

[surprising no not completely if you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m15s)

[on a lower tier account like me you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m18s)

[provisioning](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m20s)

[restrictions but West us3 works okay all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m22s)

[right cool uh 16 appears to be latest](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m25s)

[I'm going to make make us development](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m28s)

[mode unless you have a reason that we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m29s)

[should be production it looks like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m30s)

[biggest thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m32s)

[is your compute power of whether you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m34s)

[a b tier or a d tier yeah it'll be it'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m36s)

[be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m40s)

[plenty we will go there availability](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m42s)

[zones uh no preference sounds great High](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m45s)

[availability disable we do not need High](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m48s)

[availability for this standard tier oo](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m51s)

[oh they do have entra now that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m55s)

[fantastic uh yes please uh one moment y](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h22m57s)

[one moment I'm going to do some user](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m02s)

[stuff so standby while](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m04s)

[I set me as the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m08s)

[admin good plan okay great I gotta be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m14s)

[this is the only sucky part about doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m18s)

[this is I got to be real careful not to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m20s)

[uh expose something so do keep an eye](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m22s)

[out on my screen for when I've done](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m25s)

[something bad uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m26s)

[so we'll do Public Access for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m29s)

[now uh yeah I mean you you end up having](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m33s)

[to roll your own](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m37s)

[um GitHub Runners if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m39s)

[don't well I can I can private link and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m42s)

[all all kinds of stuff through so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m45s)

[will be like this one here often allows](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m47s)

[you to bypass the the GitHub Runner](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m50s)

[problem if you go with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m52s)

[hosted because they're in Azure so they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m54s)

[count as Azure service so you can they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m56s)

[are yeah it's like that is that is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h23m58s)

[pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m00s)

[convenient uh there's a browser](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m01s)

[extension that will blur as your secrets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m04s)

[oh is there really throw me throw me a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m07s)

[link in there I've tried two or three of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m10s)

[them that I found and I have not found](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m11s)

[one that works well enough for me so if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m13s)

[you've got a good one drop a link to it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m15s)

[please because I'd be very interested in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m18s)

[it the ones I've tried have been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m19s)

[intermittent it best so but I would love](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m21s)

[to have one where I could just feed it a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m25s)

[bunch of like list of Secrets and say if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m27s)

[you see this just like delete it from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m29s)

[the Dom like I almost wrote a fiddler](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m33s)

[extension one day to just rip through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m35s)

[the the HTML on its way down and strip](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m38s)

[it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m40s)

[out uh let's see Server managed key that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m41s)

[sounds great tags don't need any](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m44s)

[um yeah uh send](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m49s)

[it it estimates 12241 a month that's I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m51s)

[think we can afford this that's pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m56s)

[inexpensive yeah given that this has got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h24m59s)

[an msdn subscription with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m02s)

[some buffer room just a few just a few](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m04s)

[few bucks in there just a couple just a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m08s)

[couple okay I don't know how long this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m11s)

[thing takes to deploy but should we jump](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m13s)

[somewhere while that gu I'll put him](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m15s)

[I'll put him over here he can wait yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m17s)

[so so next piece obviously is um we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m20s)

[going to need to get vectors or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m24s)

[embeddings um for each piece of memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m27s)

[that we're going to be saving so we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m31s)

[should probably talk about what we want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m33s)

[to do for embeddings um there's a couple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m35s)

[different options uh Azure postgress](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m38s)

[first of all Azure postgress uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m42s)

[announced I believe it build this year](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m44s)

[uh has gotten internal embeddings so you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m46s)

[can have it generate its own embeddings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m49s)

[uh it does it all on the same server so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m52s)

[there's no need for an external service](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m54s)

[which is pretty sweet um I want to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m55s)

[they're one 16 the size of standard uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h25m59s)

[open AI A2 embeddings so when real quick](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m04s)

[when you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m07s)

[say that much of the size so because for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m08s)

[people's reference vectors or embeddings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m11s)

[are just uh turning text into a string](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m15s)

[of numbers so if you're familiar with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m17s)

[like drawing lines and graphing if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m20s)

[have lots of Dimensions so when we say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m23s)

[size we're talking number of data points](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m25s)

[number of Dimensions basically](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m27s)

[yeah so with with open a 8 of2 I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m29s)

[say there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m33s)

[2148 or 10 16 I don't remember off the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m35s)

[top of my head there's some no 1532 I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m40s)

[want to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m43s)

[Dimensions um in the embedding and yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m45s)

[as you were saying it's it's really just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m48s)

[a an array of numbers a vector um that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m49s)

[instead of being three or four](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m53s)

[dimensional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m55s)

[is high dimensional or has uh uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h26m56s)

[numerous Dimensions um and each one of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m00s)

[those is a floating Point number so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m03s)

[it'll put it into this hyperdimensional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m04s)

[space as a coordinate function uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m07s)

[functionally um and then when I say that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m11s)

[it's about 1 or one 16th of size um what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m14s)

[I'm really saying is that it's got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m17s)

[that sub factor of Dimensions so 1 the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m21s)

[dimensions of um the a to2 model right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m26s)

[so saying that a point in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m30s)

[two-dimensional space is 33% reduction](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m31s)

[in size than a point in threedimensional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m34s)

[space exactly and then your brain starts](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m36s)

[to hurt when we start talking about 1500](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m38s)

[dimensions and I mean it would it would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m41s)

[seem you know since these are uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m46s)

[abstract Dimensions um for those of you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m48s)

[unfamiliar with embeddings uh let me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m51s)

[give it just a quick little rundown um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m53s)

[uh one of the eest ways that I've seen](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h27m57s)

[to kind of explain it um and I give](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m00s)

[credit to our coworker Clayton though I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m03s)

[don't know if he got it from someone](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m05s)

[else um is to think about a just a 2d uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m07s)

[two-dimensional uh array or not array](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m11s)

[but um plane um from or on your x-axis](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m14s)

[it goes from masculine to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m18s)

[feminine and on your y AIS it goes from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m21s)

[uh Royal to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m26s)

[asn't and so you can imagine that if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m28s)

[were to do an embedding um for Queen it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m32s)

[would end up being very feminine very](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m36s)

[Royal um yeah we should I really wish I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m38s)

[thought about this earlier but I didn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m41s)

[I didn't get anything set up with you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m43s)

[earlier](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m46s)

[yep like I don't I don't know if I got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m48s)

[this order male female male female](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m50s)

[actually so heang on you're gonna make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m53s)

[me do this over again sorry what other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m55s)

[di you want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h28m57s)

[um do Royal to Peasant on the y axis and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m00s)

[male to female on the xaxis the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m04s)

[Royal peasant on the y axis and exactly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m07s)

[male to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m13s)

[female on the x- axis right and so Queen](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m15s)

[is like somewhere up here right yep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m18s)

[exactly Queen lives in this coordinate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m22s)

[and you can imagine that king would live](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m25s)

[in the top left](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m27s)

[and um surf which uh if I if I'm not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m29s)

[mistaken is genderless for uh in most](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m35s)

[contexts would be very peasant but would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m38s)

[not be uh masculine or feminine so it'd](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m40s)

[be near the bottom of the Y AIS be down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m44s)

[here exactly um and then you could have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m48s)

[like a maid and a maid would be female](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m50s)

[and uh less Royal maybe not all the way](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m53s)

[down to the bottom but somewhere in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m57s)

[there somewhere higher up depends on who](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h29m59s)

[you're made for maybe maybe um so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m00s)

[would be an embedding of those words um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m04s)

[and the vectors would be like one one or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m08s)

[0.331 um and so imagining it this way is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m14s)

[somewhat of a misnomer it just becomes a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m20s)

[really good way to illustrate the idea](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m21s)

[but these are not really dimension that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m24s)

[are defined at least not defined in ways](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m28s)

[that we really understand um it's not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m30s)

[that one of these you know 1500](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m34s)

[Dimensions is male female I mean it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m36s)

[could be but we don't really know and so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m39s)

[when you think of the context of like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m42s)

[going down in Dimensions you you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m45s)

[immediately think that oh it's going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m47s)

[have less performance because it's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m49s)

[to have less ways to describe something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m51s)

[uh especially more than one word where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m53s)

[you're get you're capturing the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m55s)

[semantic meaning of of you know multiple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h30m57s)

[words in a sentence or a paragraph um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m00s)

[but it's not actually always the case uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m04s)

[as with llms um you generally see more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m06s)

[performance with uh a larger um set](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m09s)

[parameters but you do have some with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m13s)

[smaller parameters or a lower number of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m16s)

[parameters that are also competing at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m18s)

[the same level uh as those larger models](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m20s)

[um and this is the same thing where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m23s)

[where you actually have some of these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m25s)

[newer embedded models cuz uh open AI Z 2](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m27s)

[is actually fairly old at this point and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m30s)

[relatively speaking within the context](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m33s)

[of of AI especially recently it's a it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m35s)

[couple three four years old I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m39s)

[say which is ancient considering a new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m42s)

[one seems to drop every couple months](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m44s)

[exactly um but what we've seen um fairly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m47s)

[recently is I want to say it's cohere uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m50s)

[put out an embedding model that is one3](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m53s)

[dimensions but actually perform slightly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m57s)

[better than Ada 2 um so again it really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h31m59s)

[comes down to uh options for us to think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m03s)

[about on um size how we want to how we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m06s)

[want to actually architect um with an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m10s)

[external service for embeddings or just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m12s)

[keep it in the database um and it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m14s)

[something you can experiment with you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m17s)

[know we could go with One Direction and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m18s)

[then set up a another uh version do some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m20s)

[AB testing between the two to see if we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m23s)

[get better performance or even run](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m25s)

[fullon um benchmarks against it uh later](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m26s)

[on we might have to develop our own](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m31s)

[Benchmark I don't know how well it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m32s)

[going to be able to answer specific](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m34s)

[keepo questions very simple what is the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m35s)

[best drink that's that that is test](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m38s)

[question number one and I will accept](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m41s)

[fair enough Mountain Dew Mountain Dew or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m42s)

[MTN do or just do I will accept any of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m45s)

[those as correct answers would you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m48s)

[maybe have said like Baja Blast in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m50s)

[past though that's a good point I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m52s)

[guess Live Wire you make a good oh man I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m55s)

[missed my Live Wire okay so I will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h32m58s)

[accept Mountain Dew or any specific](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m00s)

[variants thereof all right fantastic I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m03s)

[think we can I think we can definitely](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m06s)

[do that um so on that um I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m07s)

[probably the uh the best way to start um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m12s)

[not only a because uh it's the one that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m17s)

[I'm the most familiar with but also B it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m19s)

[gives additional uh outside context um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m23s)

[to the viewers uh we should probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m26s)

[just go with a to2 um it's pretty simple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m29s)

[to set up because you get it through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m32s)

[your open AI or Azure openi service or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m33s)

[you can do it from open AI themselves as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m36s)

[well um do their services uh and you do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m38s)

[it externally so we'll have to call out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m43s)

[to it kind of put it into our our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m44s)

[workflow um so it gives it gives more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m46s)

[context I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m49s)

[okay seems reable our we are our our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m51s)

[database is almost done deploying we are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m55s)

[we've got firewall rules going out now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h33m58s)

[fantastic so I imagine it's getting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m01s)

[close yeah do you want to I don't know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m03s)

[if you want to roll up a or spin up a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m07s)

[new one or if you have one that you want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m09s)

[to be using for this uh an open a or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m11s)

[Azure open AI service um but we could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m14s)

[probably get started there Azure open AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m17s)

[Service uh I let's hang on let me let me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m20s)

[sign in this guy again let's a new one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m24s)

[for this because I was I was going to I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m26s)

[was going to keep this all separated](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m29s)

[that way it doesn't pollute some of my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m30s)

[other projects that way when I'm done if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m32s)

[this all goes belly up I can uh just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m34s)

[throw away to the ground yeah so let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m38s)

[do here all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m41s)

[right as your AI now oh dang it that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m45s)

[not what I want I want to go creep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m48s)

[button asure AI this better hit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m50s)

[immediately oh I'm sorry it's probably a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m55s)

[open AI isn't it it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m57s)

[is okay there we go boom there we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h34m59s)

[go let's see Resource](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m05s)

[Group uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m09s)

[name see if it'll let me go west again I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m11s)

[think uh pricing tier the I heard](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m15s)

[standard was great considering that is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m17s)

[the choice uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m20s)

[see can access this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m22s)

[resource I think that's fine it's still](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m26s)

[authenticated right I can't remember we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m28s)

[may have to change the networking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m31s)

[settings on this in a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m32s)

[moment all righty we'll see how it goes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m33s)

[okay so that guy is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m37s)

[deployed we we got all we got all kinds](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m39s)

[of stuff going okay the perect well here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m41s)

[I'll bring this back now our postgress](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m44s)

[deployment is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m47s)

[complete uh Fant](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m49s)

[resource and then I might have to be a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m52s)

[little careful here in a moment and just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m54s)

[make sure cuz I'm guessing this connect](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m55s)

[thing I probably don't want to click on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m57s)

[that while this is on this screen I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h35m59s)

[would say in general no but I think if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m01s)

[I'm not mistaken they they Auto hide it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m05s)

[and then you have to unhide it yeah hang](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m07s)

[on we're gonna they've gotten better](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m09s)

[with that kind of stuff proofread](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m11s)

[it yeah they're much better Okay cool so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m16s)

[you know your pass word so that's that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m20s)

[better like it's technically exposing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m23s)

[the host name but eh whatever we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m25s)

[about to do that in code anyway](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m26s)

[yep not too concerned if I need to like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m28s)

[I said this is all in a resource Group I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m30s)

[can burn it to the ground if something's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m32s)

[goes wrong yes you can um so it's good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m34s)

[you brought us here because we are going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m38s)

[to have to add the um PG](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m39s)

[Vector add in or extension thank you yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m43s)

[um I vaguely remember something about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m47s)

[that it's isn't it like just extensions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m50s)

[here uh no it's under it's a that's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m53s)

[sub to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m56s)

[uh server parameters I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h36m58s)

[say that load up okay yep and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m02s)

[then go here no do I search PG uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m08s)

[underscore extension I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m13s)

[say s just underscore extension maybe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m18s)

[just extension been a while since I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m22s)

[done this give me one moment let me take](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m24s)

[a look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m26s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m28s)

[um okay I heard is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m30s)

[scroll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m33s)

[uh oh we don't want to scroll I just at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m36s)

[the number you can't you can't scroll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m40s)

[like 432 is is a possible number try try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m43s)

[just PG uncore](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m48s)

[Vector PG](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m51s)

[I'm why h](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m55s)

[H there may be a setting that you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h37m58s)

[to do to pull in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m01s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m05s)

[H let's see here oh hang on isn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m08s)

[there oh Azure do extensions in that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m11s)

[server parameters yeah here Azure do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m15s)

[extensions Azure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m18s)

[dot there we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m21s)

[go okay nothing's nothing's ever easy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m24s)

[were easy anyone could do it and I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m27s)

[the PG Vector all one word I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m31s)

[say no PG Vector oh Vector there we go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m39s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m43s)

[on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m45s)

[Save okay open AI is up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m51s)

[awesome all right well we can go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m55s)

[configure open AI real quick if you want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h38m57s)

[um great what would you like to do with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m00s)

[the open AI let's go into go to Azure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m01s)

[open AI studio and once we're in there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m05s)

[we'll provision a um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m08s)

[A2 instance](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m12s)

[or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m15s)

[endpoint can't remember how they ref](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m17s)

[unfamiliar with this effectively we need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m20s)

[something to take the the fancy AI model](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m23s)

[and actually do the running that's what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m27s)

[is it's also a great place to just play](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m29s)

[around and test this stuff out because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m32s)

[I've done a ton in here and it is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m34s)

[awesome like oh yeah they've added a ton](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h39m35s)

[right yep there should be a open AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h44m54s)

[maybe I don't I think they have yeah AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m00s)

[Azure open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m03s)

[AI down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m05s)

[two oh thank you yeah since we are not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m07s)

[going to open AI themselves um and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m11s)

[there's the storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m15s)

[blobs one thing well so we want the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m17s)

[document one yeah cuz the Azure blobs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m21s)

[one is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m24s)

[ated so we want this one instead yep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m27s)

[okay and then there should be a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m31s)

[postgress one as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m33s)

[well see this guy here install yes how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m42s)

[date sorry my my OCD insists that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h45m59s)

[update all packages immediately I can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m02s)

[understand that I can understand okay I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m05s)

[got a bunch of packages I've installed a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m08s)

[bunch of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m10s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m11s)

[fantastic all righty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m13s)

[well rock and roll what do I do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m16s)

[now well you probably get rid of all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m19s)

[this uh all this weather stuff since I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m21s)

[don't think we're going to be telling](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m24s)

[the weather with the uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m25s)

[I mean not yet we could add weather](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m27s)

[features later but uh weather forecast](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m30s)

[return I don't think you typically talk](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m32s)

[about the weather your streams right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m33s)

[better I mean sometimes I talk about the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m36s)

[weather like there's been rain outside](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m38s)

[there's been power outages and wind is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m41s)

[it important to you that somebody's able](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m44s)

[to ask the question like when was the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m46s)

[last time that the stream was disrupted](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m50s)

[by a thunderstorm or when was the last](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m53s)

[time that Kevin uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m55s)

[answered um what's the temperature](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h46m59s)

[outside and is it hotter today that's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m02s)

[good question I guess the only other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m06s)

[thing is wether does affect my AC unit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m07s)

[kicking on which screws with my audio so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m09s)

[you know there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m11s)

[that but hopefully not for long once I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m12s)

[move that problem hopefully goes away](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m15s)

[but it wouldn't be important for the uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m18s)

[the AI to get up to date weather in that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m20s)

[case true it's only important if it's in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m22s)

[reference to a previous time versus the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m25s)

[current time and yeah I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m27s)

[know if we want to I don't know if we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m30s)

[want to do that there I'm leaving that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m31s)

[in point because it's useful but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m33s)

[co-pilot has decided that weather is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m36s)

[really really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m38s)

[important yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m40s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m43s)

[implementation um than the default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m45s)

[excellent for reference this is bad for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m48s)

[people don't do new random random.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m51s)

[shared okay now that we've got our C tip](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m53s)

[okay where do I go first do we need an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h47m57s)

[endpoint for something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m00s)

[right so uh first let's start with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m03s)

[Services let's start getting your memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m06s)

[set up and uh everything there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m10s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m16s)

[so let's go add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m17s)

[a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m20s)

[um memory server list I want to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m23s)

[no memory service there we go memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m29s)

[service that's what I was looking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m32s)

[for okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m44s)

[sorry done done done done done no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m47s)

[worries do I need memory service yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m50s)

[you'll need a kernel memory memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m53s)

[service](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m56s)

[yes there go does this guy come with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h48m58s)

[does this guy come with something or is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m00s)

[he just I literally just injecting him](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m02s)

[straight does come with an i kernel](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m06s)

[memory huh but I'm going to need to new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m10s)

[him up with some stuff okay yes start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m12s)

[with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m14s)

[that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m15s)

[so what am I doing here I have a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m17s)

[pipeline orchestrator a search client](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m19s)

[and a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m22s)

[config and I feel L confused you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m23s)

[going to want I believe you're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m26s)

[want a pipeline orchestrator um so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m28s)

[is going to control what the kind of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m30s)

[steps in order um when you bring in new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m32s)

[data so uh let's say um you upload a new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m36s)

[video new subtitles show up in in your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m39s)

[in your markdown uh git repo and um this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m42s)

[picks it up it would go through the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m48s)

[orchestrator or use the orchestrator to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h49m50s)

[secrets like it feels bad okay so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h52m47s)

[guy here and this is going memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h52m51s)

[serverless](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h52m54s)

[memoryless and it says by Design this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h52m59s)

[class is hardcoded to use the inprocess](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m01s)

[pipeline orchestrator which seems fine](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m03s)

[to me hence the name serverless which is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m05s)

[kind of a misnomer but I get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m07s)

[it yes class access is direct the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m11s)

[storage vectors](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m15s)

[AI okay and then what is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m17s)

[this what's it type memory serverless](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m19s)

[and memory serverless is a i kernel](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m24s)

[memory so I think what I actually kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m26s)

[of want to do is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m29s)

[this I think what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m30s)

[this uh I have no idea the lifetime of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m33s)

[this so what I heard is Singletons are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m36s)

[cool Singletons until you tell me they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m40s)

[aren't thread safe or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m42s)

[something I have no idea this is for me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m45s)

[I don't think you have an issue](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m47s)

[yeah um so yes uh service add Singleton](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m50s)

[memory yes uh we're also going to need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m55s)

[to do some additional configuration](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h53m57s)

[on your memory if I'm not mistaken do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m00s)

[your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m04s)

[kernel keep going I'm just gonna just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m05s)

[gonna configure some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m07s)

[stuff all right you've got your build](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m13s)

[perfect um you want to add some plugins](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m15s)

[to your memory as well okay uh this will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m19s)

[be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m22s)

[look at that there's a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m26s)

[there's a lot of stuff you can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m28s)

[was as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m33s)

[good with custom web scraper oh this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m35s)

[some point need to put in a real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m57s)

[connection string I assume that's what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h54m58s)

[that is yep y um and then the openai](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m00s)

[default is going to need to be changed I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m05s)

[think they have a with Azure openai](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m07s)

[default um if not we'll have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m10s)

[configure it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m13s)

[manually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m15s)

[with uh Azure open a text embeddings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m17s)

[yep and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m23s)

[that ain't right so it wants](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m27s)

[a a config right yeah but it's all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m30s)

[optional which is surprising to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m34s)

[me yeah because there are defaults for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m36s)

[but how do the majority of it how do it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h55m40s)

[point I think we're going to give it an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m06s)

[API key that okay I think so so I gotta](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m08s)

[I got to pull out and I think you might](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m13s)

[need uh API endpoint as well because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m15s)

[that will be individual per um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m19s)

[per uh end point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m24s)

[for embeddings string string okay I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=00h56m27s)

[it NE we neck from your app there we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h01m52s)

[go uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h01m57s)

[here it is nice that they break those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m00s)

[out yeah well here I can just put this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m03s)

[screen um because you'll note it it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m06s)

[gives me lovely connection strings uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m09s)

[but I'm going to go out on Lim and guess](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m12s)

[that my user ID is probably not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m14s)

[undefined I probably not I don't think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m18s)

[it is probably not um that would be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m21s)

[weird](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m25s)

[would be a little strange](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m26s)

[um how do I create](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m33s)

[a action string that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h02m38s)

[point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m01s)

[so take a look at this I think is what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m03s)

[the user name then at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m49s)

[least okay yeah okay well I can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m51s)

[I can populate a connection stream that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m56s)

[looks kind of like that standing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h03m58s)

[procress B postgress that's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h04m50s)

[server uh let's see and then we set up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h04m53s)

[SSL](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h04m55s)

[mode and then the only thing that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h04m57s)

[mildly interesting is the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h04m59s)

[think I have it configured the only](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m09s)

[thing I want to do really quick is I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m11s)

[have a sinking suspicion it's going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m14s)

[try to use my a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m38s)

[okay there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h05m55s)

[that authentication failed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m02s)

[against uh I'm sorry](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m08s)

[what it loed in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m12s)

[it yeah it it's be down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m15s)

[so wa I was kind of wondering if it was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m20s)

[going to do this is it logging in is it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m22s)

[LO in as you or is it logging in as a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m25s)

[well it's logging in as the right email](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m28s)

[and then trying yeah but then hitting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m30s)

[the wrong subscription so I just need to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m33s)

[do ah yeah the right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m34s)

[one and then it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m41s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m45s)

[should then I would like to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m49s)

[on number two from that list](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m53s)

[list okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h06m56s)

[a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m01s)

[go okay I am now logged in to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m03s)

[appropriate account set to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m06s)

[appropriate subscription world's a happy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m07s)

[place again fantastic okay we have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m09s)

[connection string we have all the happy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m13s)

[things we have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m18s)

[keys we are good now what I have memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m20s)

[which is better than what I have in real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m25s)

[life you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m27s)

[memory um memory let's take a look at uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m29s)

[file storage so um with uh before your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m34s)

[build do a DOT](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m39s)

[with uh and I can't remember all the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m42s)

[options we don't want simple file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m46s)

[storage I think I want to I want to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m48s)

[it's blob file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m50s)

[storage blob document storage ah there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m52s)

[we go so we'll configure that look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m55s)

[that it gave a pretty reasonable it did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h07m59s)

[aside from the effort yeah aside from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m02s)

[the fact that it there isn't a method](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m04s)

[that takes a string so you know there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m06s)

[that it's a reasonable effort like I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m08s)

[said it's not perfect and this is the AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m11s)

[that we're trusting huh no this is not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m13s)

[we're going to use a different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m16s)

[model okay so I need a blob connection](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m19s)

[string is what it now wants me to make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m21s)

[and again I mean the biggest problem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m24s)

[here is that this AI doesn't have access](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m25s)

[to all of the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m28s)

[Corpus of Kevin's uh Kevin's streams so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m30s)

[you make a good that's the real problem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m34s)

[so if the AI just had access to all of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m36s)

[my brain this would be this would be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m38s)

[much](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m40s)

[simpler yep we would be we'd already be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m41s)

[done I mean really I mean that is that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m44s)

[is an excellent point thank](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m47s)

[you uh let's see here I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m50s)

[need Conn connection strings I'm going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m54s)

[to copy that guy out and put him](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h08m58s)

[in there okay blob connection string has](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m02s)

[been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m06s)

[created great let's see is there any](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m08s)

[other um Options under the Azure blobs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m10s)

[config oh uh let's see here we've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m15s)

[account account key off container do you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m18s)

[want to set the container name we should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m20s)

[probably set a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m22s)

[container what do you wish the contain](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m23s)

[do I need to make should I spin the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m26s)

[container you should spin the container](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m27s)

[okay uh let's see so here's the storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m30s)

[account lob](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m33s)

[containers we shall add the container](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m35s)

[and hang on I got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m37s)

[this um beautiful name because I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m40s)

[literally don't know any other name to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m43s)

[use tonight this is this is going to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m45s)

[the fuchsia of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m47s)

[tonight all right it'll be it'll be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m49s)

[fuchsia everywhere all the time we have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m53s)

[a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m57s)

[container all right so we've got your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h09m58s)

[container configured we've got your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m01s)

[memory DB](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m04s)

[configured and your open AI embeddings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m06s)

[configured](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m09s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m11s)

[so um let's start digging](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m13s)

[into the actual memory pipeline so um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m18s)

[memorizing a document](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m23s)

[that is I don't want to memorize](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m26s)

[documents that's a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m28s)

[work I mean nobody wants to we all have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m29s)

[to at some point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m33s)

[right um anyways let's open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m35s)

[up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m40s)

[a i to remember how this is handled give](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m43s)

[me one moment](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m46s)

[here that is okay you think I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m48s)

[going to just make an endpoint don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m56s)

[mind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h10m58s)

[me you do a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m05s)

[Lambda that's how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m08s)

[you that would be why](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m21s)

[do count divided by stream ID oh dear](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m28s)

[Heavens I think it's still a positive](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m31s)

[number I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m36s)

[think I I I feel like I generally](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m38s)

[consume more than one D per](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m41s)

[stream yeah I mean I'm already at two](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m44s)

[well one and a half I was already](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m48s)

[halfway through um so going back to your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m49s)

[service](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m54s)

[let's just what oh stream chat again I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h11m57s)

[know I'm sorry I don't have enough](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m01s)

[screens okay I just I just wanted to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m03s)

[make sure I was getting something just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m05s)

[wanted to make sure we had something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m08s)

[working perfect so the good news is AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m09s)

[is casc has informed me that AI is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m14s)

[better now you know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m17s)

[kids](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m20s)

[um let's start with just uh def handlers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m21s)

[so I guess we won't need to add anything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m26s)

[else there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m28s)

[um simple Q's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m31s)

[pipeline](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m34s)

[uh yeah uh dot with simple cues](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m36s)

[pipeline](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m43s)

[great and this will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m45s)

[do oh there's options there uh the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m47s)

[option there there's a config and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m51s)

[there's a directory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m53s)

[what is the directory for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m55s)

[here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h12m58s)

[um actually no this is actually tricking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m00s)

[my brain uh just don't set anything yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m03s)

[I mean I can I can get away with not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m08s)

[setting anything we're going to fall](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m10s)

[into the the empty config case should we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m11s)

[look at what's on the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m14s)

[best](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m18s)

[type um and so what this is is it's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m20s)

[it's the cu's for like ingesting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m24s)

[memory so as you request things it just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m28s)

[stores it in in memory instead of on dis](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m31s)

[or in uh some other storage got it okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m34s)

[so highly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m39s)

[volatile that should be it at least for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m42s)

[the time being we may need to do some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m45s)

[customizations on handlers um things](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m47s)

[like chunking uh partitioning uh saving](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m50s)

[um if we want to make uh changes there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m55s)

[but I think we can start with the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h13m58s)

[default and hopefully just fall into the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m01s)

[pit of success and then make edits from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m03s)

[there okay seems reasonable to me going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m05s)

[to test and make sure we can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m08s)

[instantiate uh oh no we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m11s)

[can't because it wants wants me to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m15s)

[actually do something with stream ID so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m18s)

[we're just going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m19s)

[to I wasn't using stream ID any](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m22s)

[where uh that's same let see paret of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m25s)

[service reply they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m31s)

[oh from body no from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m34s)

[services I don't think you get your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m38s)

[memory from your body Casey duh um your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m40s)

[brain is Kevin come](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m44s)

[on try it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m47s)

[out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m50s)

[okay oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m53s)

[yeah so it turns out that if you write](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m55s)

[the extension method and then don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m57s)

[invoke it it don't inject yeah it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h14m58s)

[doesn't it doesn't do anything so it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m00s)

[doesn't in fact know what it is yeah so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m02s)

[it turns out that we should probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m05s)

[invoke our extension method we should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m07s)

[probably make it an extension method](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m10s)

[that would probably be good too like I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m12s)

[have a feeling those two things will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m14s)

[probably go a long way to helping](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m17s)

[us one would help this this is this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m20s)

[why I just I simple endpoint](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m24s)

[right do it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m27s)

[work do the thing okay uh deployment](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m30s)

[name is empty so open AI config wants a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m35s)

[deployment name](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m39s)

[so let's go back](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m41s)

[here uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m44s)

[here deployment and then this is going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m48s)

[to be the name of that deployment](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m50s)

[from here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m53s)

[yes so the unique name this guy here so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h15m56s)

[this is where this actually now matters](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m00s)

[yeah yep grab him that is correct put](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m03s)

[him in rinse repeat try again I believe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m12s)

[and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m15s)

[money no money yet uh let's see unable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m16s)

[to resolve I text generator](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m25s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m27s)

[yeah it's because of the simple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m29s)

[pipeline](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m32s)

[um we need to do something to make it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m34s)

[happy because I I agree with it I did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m38s)

[not register an itex generator nor do I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m40s)

[know how to register it you did not and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m42s)

[I thought you could get away without](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m46s)

[registering one but I guess I am](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m48s)

[wrong answers and summaries okay yeah uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m51s)

[add your open AI text generation uh you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m56s)

[will have to spin up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h16m59s)

[a um deployment for that uh we can start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m01s)

[with like a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m05s)

[3.5 uh all right so you want to go here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m06s)

[here here here right correct correct](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m10s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m13s)

[uh and then this is going to be what Tex](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m15s)

[or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m19s)

[chat](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m20s)

[chat great and we want you said like a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m22s)

[GPT 35 something or another](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m26s)

[yep uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m31s)

[see like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m33s)

[different oh I think you can turn down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m39s)

[your uh your rate on your embeddings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m42s)

[model got it uh because it tried to take](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m48s)

[all of the all of the and I want you to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m52s)

[have yeah we start with that I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h17m57s)

[that is your problem though new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m01s)

[deployment](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m04s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m06s)

[chat uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m11s)

[see uh drop down the provision](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m14s)

[managed do you have options there you do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m17s)

[not have options there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m19s)

[I just need a different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m24s)

[model uh I wouldn't think so but try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m26s)

[hold on let me oh hang on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m31s)

[40 much happier about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m33s)

[40 uh let's see and do what do I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m37s)

[for my deployment type on this which one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m40s)

[of the this is what I don't like about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m42s)

[these I'm guessing standard is cheaper](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m44s)

[than global standard but is provision](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m45s)

[managed greater than](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m47s)

[Global I believe so yes because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m49s)

[provision baged I believe is you have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m51s)

[your own separate deployment as opposed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m54s)

[to I believe that the majority of these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m56s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m58s)

[pull um when you actually send in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h18m59s)

[requests](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m03s)

[okay I got one of these suckers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m06s)

[now very nice model retirement](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m10s)

[date wow they already they already have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m14s)

[retirement dates figured out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m17s)

[excellent that means there's more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m19s)

[goodness coming down the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m21s)

[pipeline at least that's what it says to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m23s)

[me I mean by next year I imagine that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m25s)

[these things are like ancient](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m27s)

[grandfather models like we're on GPT 18](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m29s)

[point something or whatever okay so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m33s)

[where do I get this text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m36s)

[generation uh was it text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m38s)

[generator it's going to be it's going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m41s)

[be another wi under your kernel](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m43s)

[memory oh this says without text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m51s)

[generator](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m54s)

[oh hang on Theory you might be able to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h19m59s)

[do that let's just try that I don't that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m02s)

[might have been what I missed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m04s)

[yeah I think you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m06s)

[right okay no don't get excited yet come](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m15s)

[on uh authentication type unknown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m17s)

[so I'm guessing on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m28s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m29s)

[off um connection string there we go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m34s)

[that will probably fix that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m38s)

[one it bothers me that they did a nested](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m41s)

[enom under their config type because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m43s)

[that just looks funny but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m45s)

[whatever yeah memory is the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m49s)

[key I prefer it over magic strings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m52s)

[though it's at least a little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m56s)

[nicer you know you don't have to know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h20m58s)

[the magic string you get some a complete](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m00s)

[I want to type this I mean yeah I'm lazy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m02s)

[I mean yes I can using static my way](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m07s)

[into that but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m10s)

[yeah you not a using static guy no I I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m12s)

[am it's just having to do it for stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m16s)

[like this makes me annoyed fair enough](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m18s)

[fair enough okay um and then you've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m21s)

[edings so we actually we actually now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m28s)

[hit all the way through on our end point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m30s)

[so we got a kernel memory instance](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m32s)

[back all right so that is good I now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m36s)

[have a method with a kernel memory what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m39s)

[should we do with it besides returning a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m42s)

[uh a well-known string well let's start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m44s)

[let's start with just uh and this is why](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m48s)

[I do controllers because I'm so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m50s)

[it throws me off to look at uh I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m55s)

[convince you that these things are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m57s)

[better so it's so it just throws me off](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h21m58s)

[uh start however you make a normal web](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m02s)

[API in this weird world of not having](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m06s)

[different classes uh do that do the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m09s)

[thing okay I've done that what this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m13s)

[your this is your controller method](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m16s)

[right here what would you like in your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m17s)

[controller](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m20s)

[method uh you've already got your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m21s)

[services all set up you pulled in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m23s)

[service perfect I got Colonel M right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m24s)

[here what do you want to do with it so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m26s)

[see how easy that was let's first start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m28s)

[with the c or memory dot um inest or do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m32s)

[import document async that's the one I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m38s)

[looking import document](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m40s)

[async import text async oh this looks](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m42s)

[like so much](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m46s)

[fun document upload request I want a new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m48s)

[one of those don't I yes document upload](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m51s)

[request](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m54s)

[okay what does a document upload request](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m55s)

[have it has a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h22m58s)

[document could have probably guessed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m00s)

[that uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m03s)

[so files how many files can I okay so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m07s)

[you can you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m11s)

[can the hierarchy is a little bit weird](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m13s)

[and it's been a while since I looked at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m16s)

[it and so I do not remember it off the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m18s)

[top of my head but there is a hierarchy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m19s)

[so a document while it sounds like it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m21s)

[one file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m23s)

[in the context of this is multiple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m25s)

[files so you could put your subtitles as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m28s)

[a document but I would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m31s)

[not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m34s)

[actually you could we'll do it for now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m37s)

[what I heard is hardcode the directory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m40s)

[immediately that's what I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m43s)

[did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m47s)

[okay all right now do I do I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m49s)

[send do I want to send everything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m52s)

[uh we're going to rename this to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h23m56s)

[indest so spell it you spell it in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m01s)

[just gez see this is why a spell checker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m07s)

[is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m09s)

[important okay so sorry you were talking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m12s)

[about the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m15s)

[files yeah so you'll need the files um I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m17s)

[think there we'll have to give it a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m21s)

[document ID which be a name for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m23s)

[it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m33s)

[they they really like their nested](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m35s)

[classes they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m38s)

[do uh devis went to town on on this file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m40s)

[name file content and it wants a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m45s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m50s)

[oh you can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m52s)

[yeah as you dig deeper and deeper you'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m56s)

[see some more of the power that I just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h24m58s)

[don't even remember to say this feels](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m00s)

[this feels like power that I shouldn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m02s)

[have because now I can do something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m04s)

[like oh oh buddy oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m07s)

[buddy files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m11s)

[select uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m15s)

[new oh man document upload request](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m18s)

[upload file right and then I can Fe a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m21s)

[file name which is X uh or how about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m24s)

[path get file name of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m29s)

[X and then I don't know if it's file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m32s)

[open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m36s)

[read](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m41s)

[now this is probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m43s)

[bad partially because this is going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m46s)

[open up a bunch of file handles and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m48s)

[don't know if it's going to properly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m50s)

[close them or not because I'm just arbit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m52s)

[thrown a stream at it is it going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m54s)

[terminate the stream it's going to hold](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m56s)

[the file handle open I have no idea I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h25m58s)

[have no idea I want to say it terminates](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m01s)

[the stream I'm GNA hope so because we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m04s)

[we're going for it because otherwise](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m06s)

[we're going to link where X do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m10s)

[um uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m11s)

[see uh path get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m14s)

[extension](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m19s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m23s)

[MD just going to filter I don't think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m25s)

[there's anything other than markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m27s)

[files in this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m29s)

[folder but in the event that I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m30s)

[wrong I would like to not accidentally](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m34s)

[ingest](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m37s)

[everything we go up over down and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m38s)

[think these are all just markdown files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m43s)

[and then for purposes of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m45s)

[Sanity there's an ey disposable code](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m47s)

[analyzer yeah I'm aware of that but this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m49s)

[API takes in the Stream so it's very](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m52s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m55s)

[that the this guy handles terminating it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h26m56s)

[once the uploads Complete because he](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m00s)

[then owns the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m01s)

[stream the difficulty is knowing if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m03s)

[that's the case or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m06s)

[not oh what does this Constructor do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m10s)

[document file oh that's interesting okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m13s)

[so like you're were saying the document](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m16s)

[could contain multiple files interesting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m17s)

[okay we'll do that we'll do this we'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m20s)

[go with await](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m23s)

[case you want to know how to make this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m25s)

[async done](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m26s)

[woo uh very nice um okay so we're going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m30s)

[to do this I still don't like it can I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m33s)

[is there a benefit to firing everything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m37s)

[or is there a benefit to doing something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m38s)

[like this and just dialing it down a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m40s)

[little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m42s)

[bit uh well we'll have turnaround time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m43s)

[that's faster by dialing it down I like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m46s)

[faster turn](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m48s)

[around um in fact I think I'm going to I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m50s)

[think I'm going to go a little further](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m53s)

[and I'm going to do it up here right and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m54s)

[I'm going to do this that way I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h27m57s)

[can that way here I can just do this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m03s)

[right so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m06s)

[will this way I can I can kind of be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m07s)

[intelligent about it right and then just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m11s)

[we're going to force iteration so I can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m14s)

[see it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m15s)

[okay anything else or do do I full oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m18s)

[I've been debugging this whole time do I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m21s)

[just full send](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m23s)

[it do I need anything else is it really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m25s)

[that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m28s)

[easy it will this work for one method](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m28s)

[call I mean yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m32s)

[mostly of course when you do this you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m35s)

[going to have to you know handle your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m37s)

[file upload uh and then there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m40s)

[other uh depth](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m44s)

[to how we handle chunking and stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m46s)

[because right now we're just relying on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m49s)

[the defa the ho is what I heard yep fire](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m50s)

[in the hole okay we're gonna if this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m54s)

[works I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h28m57s)

[be like I I mean it technically didn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m00s)

[work first try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m02s)

[but okay so one we're going to step and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m06s)

[make sure I get a couple markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m08s)

[files okay those look like markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m10s)

[files markdown files to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m13s)

[me uh let's see I don't know that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m17s)

[don't want to step into that we're just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m20s)

[going to run](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m22s)

[uh 500 pipeline ID is empty oh this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m24s)

[your comment earlier when you said we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m28s)

[need we're going to need give him a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m29s)

[document ID and I promptly disregarded](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m30s)

[that statement apparently when you don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m32s)

[give it a document ID it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m34s)

[crashes you do need a document ID that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m36s)

[is correct okay so where where does this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m39s)

[document ID go on the upload request](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m42s)

[document ID what is a document](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m44s)

[ID it is just a string that is used to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m48s)

[identify that specific document um um so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m51s)

[again when you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m54s)

[have when you're doing an upload uh of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m56s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h29m59s)

[same document or files uh again the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m00s)

[hierarchy is kind of weird to look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m04s)

[there um it'll use that to identify](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m06s)

[within your um oh if there's a new or if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m09s)

[it's the same](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m13s)

[exactly oh interesting so I wonder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m18s)

[does it make sense to break up each file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m24s)

[into its own document upload so that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m26s)

[they I could key them on file name I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m29s)

[more of a I'm more of that kind of guy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m31s)

[um and there's a couple there's a couple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m34s)

[things that come to that uh adding just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m37s)

[one file I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m40s)

[believe from my me if memory serves me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m42s)

[and you share a document ID with all the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m45s)

[files in that folder you'll be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m47s)

[re-uploading everything see I was really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m49s)

[hoping that was going to be a memory pun](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m52s)

[there with the memory serves me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m54s)

[correctly but you know you missed it and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m55s)

[now the moment's lost yeah I'm sorry I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h30m58s)

[not good with disappointed in you now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m00s)

[because we'll work on it we'll work on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m03s)

[it it's fine it's understandable I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m05s)

[disappointed in myself can I say I mean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m06s)

[you you had the perfect setup and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m09s)

[everything so it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m10s)

[was and now I can document ID this based](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m15s)

[on uh path get file name because I know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m19s)

[these are going to be unique](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m22s)

[because these are files in my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m24s)

[directory so I'm not worried about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m26s)

[collisions there there you go we'll do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m28s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m35s)

[ingest okay got that got that got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m39s)

[it's uploading a file doing something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m47s)

[it hasn't died](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h31m56s)

[yet I guess I probably should have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h32m02s)

[looked how big of a file did I just send](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h32m04s)

[portion](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m40s)

[of the thing so it it it chunked it yep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m41s)

[I mean it it chunked it weirdly but you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m47s)

[know because you know I might have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m49s)

[broken on a new line rather than you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m50s)

[know middle of a URL but what what do I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m52s)

[know I'm not a computer I'm just a mere](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m54s)

[human so if I'm not mistaken it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m56s)

[breaking on uh number of tokens so just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h34m58s)

[go part goes tell it parts so in theory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m02s)

[there might be some Advanced somebody](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m05s)

[like me who knows something about the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m07s)

[content could chunk it slightly more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m08s)

[intelligently absolutely and that's and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m11s)

[that's true across the board not just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m13s)

[for um for stuff with a specific format](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m14s)

[like this um but that's also going to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m18s)

[true for documents um understanding uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m20s)

[like the structure of your documents and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m23s)

[breaking that or chunking it which how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m26s)

[it's worded or understood um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m29s)

[understanding where to chunk it so that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m32s)

[you retain context um there's also the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m33s)

[ability to bring in uh context from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m36s)

[above where your chunk actually starts](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m39s)

[so you'll you'll append another like 20](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m41s)

[tokens from before your the start of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m43s)

[your chunk and then another 20 tokens](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m46s)

[after the end or something like that and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m48s)

[what that does is it just makes sure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m50s)

[that you've got additional content text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m52s)

[that came before and after the the main](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m53s)

[section of that chunk um little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m56s)

[different in this case but um we will do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h35m58s)

[some unique chunking to specifically not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m02s)

[cut on those um those right because it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m04s)

[separate subtitles yeah in theory might](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m09s)

[lose something in that in that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m13s)

[break yeah and I mean the other part of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m16s)

[that that we can we can look at and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m18s)

[possibly decide to do is we can take](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m21s)

[those and we could parse it such that we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m24s)

[actually bring all of that actual words](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m26s)

[together and just use the first of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m30s)

[um time stamps as a time stamp for where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m35s)

[this paragraph for this you know I don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m38s)

[know how many seconds if you go to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m41s)

[top of this what's the what's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m42s)

[beginning time this you see this is like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m44s)

[1 hour 46 minutes 42 seconds so it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m46s)

[like every 3 seconds this thing's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m48s)

[oh you're talking about what is the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m50s)

[beginning one in this file what's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m51s)

[duration yeah so I mean it cut in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m53s)

[middle but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m55s)

[01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:10,000](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h36m57s)

to uh 46 45 so what is that 1 minute

[and 9 seconds yeah something I mean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m05s)

[something relatively small yeah we'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m10s)

[call we'll call it a minute](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m12s)

[plus give take a little bit like we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m14s)

[could we could chunk them into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m17s)

[individual](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m18s)

[minutes yeah and that's that's a whole](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m19s)

[another option we could look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m21s)

[specifically going after a duration of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m23s)

[time as opposed to going number of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m25s)

[tokens and then using the first time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m29s)

[stamp um and then again with that uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m31s)

[going by amount of time we could do the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m34s)

[15 seconds ahead of that and the 15](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m37s)

[seconds after it make it a full minute](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m39s)

[30 your main context or your main uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m41s)

[Unique Piece is that that individ or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m44s)

[that um that minute that's in between](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m47s)

[the two uh but yeah so is is it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m50s)

[intelligent in because you said tokens](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m53s)

[and tokens are not equal to characters](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m56s)

[but but I noticed that it broke right at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h37m58s)

[a period is it being mildly intelligent](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m01s)

[about what like this would have been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m04s)

[right after a period because it would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m06s)

[have been the the be portion of a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m08s)

[URI I'd be willing to bet if you go and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m11s)

[grab another one yeah if you go and grab](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m14s)

[another one of these I'd be willing to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m16s)

[bet you'll find the same thing as the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m18s)

[case and that's because it's probably uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m19s)

[by default set up to pull out regular](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m23s)

[documents you know paragraph sentences](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m25s)

[um so it's not going to break at the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m27s)

[middle of a sentence or middle of a word](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m29s)

[I'm thinking versus it's GNA it's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m31s)

[to be it's going to have some amount of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m34s)

[intelligence about it absolutely that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m36s)

[would make that would make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m39s)

[sense I'm realizing that doing three](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m41s)

[documents may have been too](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m43s)

[many well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m47s)

[yeah it may have been Overkill but I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m50s)

[am curious here because this had 68](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m53s)

[before we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m55s)

[started so it's it is now chunking more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h38m57s)

[than it than it had](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m02s)

[before because we we doubled our number](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m04s)

[of items so because I was surprised that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m06s)

[it it's not chunking more it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m08s)

[processing them so if you expand out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m11s)

[that name further oh you're right to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m12s)

[text embedding so let's go into to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m16s)

[text embedding let's take a look at what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m19s)

[that file looks like because it's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m20s)

[to be another normal text file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m21s)

[and what this does](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m27s)

[is you can set this up again as oh dear](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m29s)

[Heavens hold that thought hold that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m33s)

[thought we're going to try this again](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m35s)

[we're going to open it in something that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m37s)

[uh understands what Json looks](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m40s)

[like Sor right I'm sorry it's because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m47s)

[it's not it's not listed as a Json yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m50s)

[yeah they go pretty F yeah there we go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m52s)

[okay so for people who wanted to know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m57s)

[what a vector](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h39m59s)

[is there is a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m00s)

[vector and when people talk about number](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m03s)

[of Dimensions it's how long do you want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m05s)

[to scroll until you find the end of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m07s)

[these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m09s)

[numbers that is roughly what it means](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m10s)

[15 hey there we go 1544](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m14s)

[from so minus seven right so that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m18s)

[1530 didn't you say like 1532 or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m24s)

[thereabouts 15 yeah thereabouts oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m26s)

[Vector size](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m29s)

[1536 that's my guess there we go I can't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m30s)

[math my face of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m34s)

[course](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m36s)

[um so yeah so this is when it says text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m38s)

[embedding to do what that's the that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m42s)

[the name of your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m46s)

[generator um so the default I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m48s)

[name of the uh the default um instance](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m53s)

[that they build for you is called too I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h40m58s)

[believe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m02s)

[oh okay not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m04s)

[100% fair enough](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m06s)

[um and do these numbers vary from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m11s)

[like like what's the range on these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m15s)

[because they all look to be small it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m17s)

[looks like negative one plusus one plus](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m19s)

[or minus one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m22s)

[yeah okay floating points between one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m24s)

[and negative one got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m26s)

[it so whatever these arbitrary](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m29s)

[dimensions are I am not a one or a zero](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m32s)

[in any of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m34s)

[them I heard it's pretty hard it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m36s)

[pretty hard to get a one or zero on on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m38s)

[them I I imagine so because that would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m40s)

[mean that you would basically have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m43s)

[meet that Dimension perfectly and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m45s)

[you might know something about the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m47s)

[dimension this Dimension is All About](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m49s)

[Love of Mountain Dew there you go um all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m51s)

[right so you can close that we've got to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m56s)

[take a look there uh if you go back to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h41m57s)

[the number of files when we go down to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m00s)

[the bottom here let's see what the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m03s)

[biggest um or the last text file is well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m04s)

[so I'm noticing I I may want to jump up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m10s)

[because I it looks like stream sorting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m13s)

[so I think this 63 is probably my last](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m16s)

[one probably you're probably on to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m19s)

[next one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m22s)

[go ahead and open up the uh pipeline](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m24s)

[status Json we'll take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m26s)

[that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m27s)

[too](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m28s)

[Json I wonder can I I don't know can I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m31s)

[hit this straight a browser no because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m35s)

[you didn't turn Public Access on well I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m40s)

[don't really want to turn public like I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m42s)

[mean the source data is public so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m44s)

[yeah all right there you go so what this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m47s)

[is going to show you is it's showing you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m50s)

[basically all of the information about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m53s)

[this this uh ingestion run your top is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m55s)

[your index so you have a default index](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h42m59s)

[that it gives you inside of your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m01s)

[postgress um database or your your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m04s)

[vector database and so it starts out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m07s)

[with the default you can obviously name](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m09s)

[that um specifically which document](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m10s)

[you're looking at you only one I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m13s)

[uploaded so far there you go uh a unique](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m15s)

[execution ID okay um below that is the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m18s)

[steps that it took so the first thing it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m22s)

[did is it extracted the text out of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m23s)

[file it then did partitioning on it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m26s)

[generated embeddings for each one of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m28s)

[those partitions and then it saved it um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m29s)

[so far yep exactly you can see that the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m33s)

[only step remaining is saving but it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m35s)

[done the other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m37s)

[pieces oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m38s)

[interesting that feels like it's track](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m40s)

[state that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m43s)

[cool it hasn't in my breakpoint yet so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m47s)

[it had so it's still we're still pending](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m49s)

[it might be the case that it's already](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m55s)

[on file two at this point it shouldn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m56s)

[be because I got a break point at the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m58s)

[end of my four each oh okay yeah yeah I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h43m59s)

[it it hasn't iterated yet so what we can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m03s)

[do though is we can go post go to here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m06s)

[we can go over to postgress](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m10s)

[okay you're gonna actually probably need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m14s)

[because they don't have a uh a clean way](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m17s)

[to do this from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m19s)

[here although they may have a terminal](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m21s)

[now no they don't have a terminal yet do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m24s)

[they looking so what you're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m27s)

[want to do is you're going to get like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m30s)

[PG admin or another um postgress uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m31s)

[interface I heard wind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m35s)

[get yes sir or yeah wi get chocy you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m38s)

[should be able to find it on any of them](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m43s)

[um so we'll use that to connect in and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m45s)

[we'll start to see those actual May](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m48s)

[o password](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m54s)

[has uh let's see no password has been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h44m56s)

[provided let's see here so this is you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m02s)

[know what let's do this let's make our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m06s)

[life](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m08s)

[easy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m10s)

[um because we know what the connection](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m11s)

[string looks like with a username and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m13s)

[password yep I can set this things off](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m15s)

[to did it go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m21s)

[connect or server](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m26s)

[parameters where was the security](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m30s)

[security right thank you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m33s)

[y right now this is using enter ID let](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m37s)

[me let me set it to both wait wait go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m42s)

[back go back real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m44s)

[quick what's at the bottom of that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m46s)

[page my user that I added](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m49s)

[admin but let me let me set it to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m53s)

[both right and then I will create an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m55s)

[admin](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h45m58s)

[username and password go and by I will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m00s)

[create a password I will open up bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m03s)

[word and say generate me a big long ugly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m05s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m07s)

[password it does simplify it uh and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m10s)

[then we'll save](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m15s)

[that you want to set the uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m18s)

[post and restart the server continue yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m23s)

[so apparently changing that requires a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m27s)

[server restart so we will let the server](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m29s)

[restart and then I will go and tweak the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m31s)

[connection string in the secrets to just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m34s)

[have a username and password and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m36s)

[then I can fuss with figuring out the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m39s)

[the managed identity bits right yeah and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m43s)

[save ourselves a little bit of little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m46s)

[bit of troubleshooting yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m49s)

[like that idea I think it's just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m52s)

[password equals and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m56s)

[value I believe that is the case uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h46m58s)

[password equals value yes okay because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m03s)

[the thing is rebooting so I can't go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m05s)

[look at the hopefully generated](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m07s)

[connection](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m10s)

[strings yeah the operation has been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m11s)

[accepted okay I do like though that it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m14s)

[smart enough to where when I restart](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m17s)

[this it doesn't like start over from the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m19s)

[beginning](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m21s)

[that's very very very very](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m23s)

[convenient well that's yeah it's it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m26s)

[much more robust um as a again as a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m29s)

[service like uh SM kernel was never](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m34s)

[intended to be its own Standalone](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m37s)

[service Colonel memory is and it's uh he](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m38s)

[they've done very well with with setting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m42s)

[it up um for uh recovery so real quick](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m44s)

[then the semantic colonel and Colonel](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m50s)

[memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m53s)

[are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m55s)

[related uh not related like I'm in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h47m57s)

[indirectly related so so SM colel came](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m00s)

[out uh crap we were just a build and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m04s)

[still don't remember what the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m07s)

[anniversary was um but it it's been two](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m08s)

[odd years I want to say at this point um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m12s)

[since samanta Colonel came out and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m14s)

[samanta kernel was just intended to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m17s)

[allow people to make AI apps um so it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m18s)

[did the interfacing out to your llms it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m23s)

[did text embeddings it had very similar](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m25s)

[things to to what you have in Cal memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m28s)

[um and then it also provided um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m31s)

[connections to databases so a lot of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m34s)

[same stuff that you're finding here in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m36s)

[fact the majority of the things that you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m37s)

[can do with CTIC kernel you can do in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m40s)

[kernel memory but what it also had it on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m41s)

[top of that is um other Concepts like uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m44s)

[agentic stuff so having um multiple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m48s)

[agents that you could then have talking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m52s)

[to each other um it added in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m54s)

[um rag so before this obviously does rag](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h48m59s)

[as well but before colel memory it had](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m04s)

[rag um as one of the earlier uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m07s)

[Frameworks or libraries that provided um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m10s)

[the tooling around that um the other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m13s)

[being Lang chain um and then it also had](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m16s)

[uh planners so giving a a AIA a or llm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m20s)

[the ability or the application the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m26s)

[ability to make a request with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m28s)

[um say build me a plan to find out this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m31s)

[information and your AI would then spit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m35s)

[out multiple steps and then it would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m37s)

[resend each one of those steps](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m39s)

[individually to the llm to kind of give](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m41s)

[you this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m44s)

[um uh break down a problem into smaller](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m46s)

[pieces for the AI to be or have an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m50s)

[easier time uh solving a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m52s)

[problem um and so some of those things](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m55s)

[specifically the agentic stuff and the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h49m58s)

[um planner stuff is not available in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m02s)

[Colonel memory but what colel memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m04s)

[does really well is Rag and all of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m06s)

[uh memory related stuff um and it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m09s)

[they've said uh devis one of the one of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m14s)

[the main Architects and developers said](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m18s)

[that really it was um kind of a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m20s)

[a project of uh loving the idea and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m23s)

[wanting to take all of the learnings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m26s)

[that they had from semantic kernel and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m27s)

[really make it more robust uh a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m29s)

[standalone service um really enhance the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m31s)

[the ability to use it um uh in a wider](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m34s)

[context really got it okay so in in a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m39s)

[lot of ways then colel memory is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m43s)

[semantic colel V](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m45s)

[V2 from the memory perspective](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m48s)

[absolutely um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m50s)

[absolutely yeah that makes that makes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m53s)

[some sense in my head okay we are on to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m56s)

[running](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h50m59s)

[now we did not immediately](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m00s)

[die so did you want to look at so oh you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m04s)

[wanted me to go get like PG admin](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m10s)

[right yes yeah let's grab PG admin](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m12s)

[because that'll allow us to uh take a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m16s)

[look as it saves into the database which](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m18s)

[obviously it wasn't or was having issues](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m21s)

[there prior](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m23s)

[um and what we were waiting for would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m26s)

[must have been uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m29s)

[time default timeout](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m32s)

[stuff well or re or number of retries](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m34s)

[rather well it's possible the fact that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m38s)

[it had the off wrong](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m40s)

[though yeah yeah maybe not it did seem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m42s)

[like quite a delay before we saw it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m46s)

[though yeah but remember the first time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m48s)

[we ran it didn't get all the way through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m50s)

[the chunky stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m51s)

[so I imagine it had to do some of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m54s)

[chunky stuff I I think that air may have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m56s)

[come up while we were looking at the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m58s)

[stuff in the storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h51m59s)

[account but okay PG](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m02s)

[admin](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m05s)

[Gober PG admin do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m07s)

[Gober and having that username and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m11s)

[password will actually make it easier to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m14s)

[log in here as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m15s)

[well oh shoot you telling me I have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m17s)

[remember what I said it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m19s)

[to um I mean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m21s)

[preferably it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m24s)

[okay that's that's what bit Wen is for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m26s)

[is to remember the password so that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m29s)

[don't have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m30s)

[yeah is that a cloud cloud](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m33s)

[service it is but it's not but even](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m37s)

[though it's stored in the cloud they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m40s)

[unless you give up your master key your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m42s)

[uh your vault is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m46s)

[encrypted so it shouldn't be decryptable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m48s)

[without the master key](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m50s)

[okay okay so so yes your data your data](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m54s)

[is exist in in a cloud but it's open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h52m57s)

[source and you can self-host it if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m01s)

[want that I like I like the fact that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m03s)

[you can self-host it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m05s)

[although H it's hard to it's hard to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m07s)

[feel comfortable putting anything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m10s)

[password like uh on the internet anymore](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m12s)

[yeah which is part of why I was like I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m14s)

[could do it but then I have to be like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m17s)

[responsible for updating you've got to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m19s)

[do all the updates](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m21s)

[problem yeah companies are doing this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m24s)

[and have had failures in the past so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m26s)

[makes you think you can do better right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m29s)

[yeah it's it's always tough well and the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m31s)

[hard part is is you there are some local](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m34s)

[password](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m35s)

[managers but then you have the issue of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m36s)

[well I want it on my phone and I want it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m39s)

[on my computer like at some point I got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m41s)

[to get the data from point A of point B](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m44s)

[I live in the bane of I just have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m48s)

[separate on machine password managers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m50s)

[and recycle passwords though isn't that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m54s)

[a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m57s)

[pain absolutely it is a pain yes I just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h53m58s)

[do it you suffer](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m02s)

[suffer uh I don't know who was who was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m06s)

[it that got hacked who was it that got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m10s)

[hacked I don't remember who it was at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m11s)

[this point keepass or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m13s)

[uh yes um I mean it wasn't all that long](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m15s)

[ago and that's why I just like I just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h54m19s)

[you what was our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h55m57s)

[exciting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m14s)

[wow those lots of server sessions lots](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m17s)

[of stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m20s)

[uh let's see here type Vector does not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m24s)

[exist I believe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m28s)

[we added](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m32s)

[that see see if I can solve this before](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m35s)

[in front of my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m58s)

[coworker okay so we have Vector is there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h56m59s)

[another one in here that we are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m03s)

[missing is there another](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m06s)

[one okay it doesn't immediately jump out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m19s)

[of me hold up hold up I just see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m21s)

[it is that a button we should have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m26s)

[on don't know what that I don't know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m29s)

[what Azure AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m31s)

[does hang on let's go here let's go here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m32s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m36s)

[see uh type Vector does not exist we go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m41s)

[here we go magical](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m44s)

[AI uh I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m50s)

[turned I could hear you the entire time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m53s)

[and it was great because uh I've run](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m56s)

[into that same problem um the key with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h57m59s)

[postgress](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m02s)

[is you have to add it inside the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m04s)

[database](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m08s)

[yep install the post create extension](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m11s)

[command to ensure that the vector type](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m14s)

[is available in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m16s)

[database then what did we add on the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m18s)

[outside the extension to the server but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m20s)

[we didn't add it to the database yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m22s)

[dang nabbit spot](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m25s)

[on dang NAB it okay so we okay got it so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m26s)

[it's also good we have PG admin because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m31s)

[I assume we got to go in here based upon](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m33s)

[what co-pilot just said a second ago](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m35s)

[that is the one so I go here I go here I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m37s)

[go here and I go how do I create an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m41s)

[extension create extension excellent](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m44s)

[Name vector](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m49s)

[uh I think it's PG uncore Vector but and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m52s)

[I don't I want to say you don't want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m57s)

[create it I'm G have to have to double](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h58m59s)

[check here just a moment PG Vector is it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m03s)

[an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m06s)

[option Vector is so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m07s)

[disagree with you based upon my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m10s)

[extensive knowledge of this it yeah it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m13s)

[probably is since the naming is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m16s)

[different in Azure also the Azure open a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m18s)

[or the azure AI uh extension I believe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m21s)

[is what adds the ability to do um in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m24s)

[database embeddings ah okay I'm not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m27s)

[mistaken okay so I have now added the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m32s)

[vector](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m36s)

[extension okay so refresh your um your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m37s)

[postgress](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m42s)

[there uh the database](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m43s)

[level and let's go to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m49s)

[uh schemas I want to say go to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m52s)

[schemas and then go to public and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m56s)

[go to types and let's see if we've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=01h59m58s)

[anything special in there hey your big](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m00s)

[head is in the way so I got to got Mo](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m03s)

[got I got to move this for everyone](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m06s)

[else Vector there's a vector all right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m08s)

[perfect so that resolves that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m12s)

[issue okay so rinse repeat do it again](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m15s)

[spot on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m19s)

[I got myself some pineapple juice I know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m22s)

[it's not Mountain Dew I'm sorry you can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m24s)

[banish me whenever I we might have to uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m26s)

[I don't have to restart my debugging](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m30s)

[session I could just hit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m31s)

[go CU really so it it must be redoing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m36s)

[some of this because it doesn't die](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m39s)

[immediately like it there is some amount](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m42s)

[that it red does um each time I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m45s)

[pushing the sucker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m48s)

[up and what you could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m50s)

[do well actually no uh because I imagine](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m53s)

[like it gets a document with the same ID](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h00m59s)

[right so in theory it should know that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m02s)

[it doesn't need to but I've had to push](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m03s)

[this stre](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m06s)

[like I'm curious how intelligent it is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m08s)

[to send the ID first and then only feed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m10s)

[the data if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m13s)

[needed yeah I think by default it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m14s)

[probably is um redoing the entire](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m18s)

[process um I think we may need to set](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m22s)

[some additional settings for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m26s)

[the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m33s)

[processing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m35s)

[uh I would that be in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m38s)

[kernel I think it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m43s)

[actually oh man it would be in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m46s)

[kernel it would be I want to say in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m50s)

[handlers you wouldn't see it oh actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m54s)

[yeah you could see it there because you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m57s)

[can go you can dig](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h01m58s)

[but only drawback with not restarting my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m05s)

[sessions now I have the stack Trace here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m08s)

[and I'm now always left wondering if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m09s)

[I've figured a new one I mean I've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m12s)

[my break point set so I'll either hit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m14s)

[the end of the 4 each or I'll hit the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m16s)

[catch there are no alternate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m18s)

[paths there is no other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m20s)

[option but I am realizing how how much](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m27s)

[this is going to like to rip through all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m30s)

[of my video streams this thing's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m32s)

[to like I'm going to kick this thing off](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m34s)

[and and then I think I'm going to go to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m37s)

[work yeah and then I'm gonna hope that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m39s)

[it's done by the time I get home for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m41s)

[that amount of data it may take a little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m43s)

[bit of ingestion what's the what's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m46s)

[size um of that folder total size](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m48s)

[yeah what's the total size of that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m52s)

[folder and I can tell you in a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h02m53s)

[there may have been a lot of people](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m44s)

[involved in this this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m45s)

[website at some point nuts I I think we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m47s)

[may I I think we want to do a talk](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m50s)

[on what we did because the software](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m53s)

[behind this isn't necessarily](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m56s)

[proprietary but it's not open source](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h03m58s)

[either yeah there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m00s)

[infrastructure to generate a very simple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m03s)

[website well and and amount](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m07s)

[infrastructure and not to confuse that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m12s)

[though not really infrastructure but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m14s)

[like software architecture behind it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m17s)

[yeah because you know you say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m20s)

[infrastructure I think oh we had to uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m22s)

[spin up a bunch of azure resources it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m25s)

[wasn't it didn't take that many](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m26s)

[resources but the amount of code that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m27s)

[went into you know how many containers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m30s)

[we had to spend to host this sucker most](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m32s)

[people who basically host a static](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m34s)

[website that's one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m36s)

[thing this is functionally a static site](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m38s)

[is and then we added login stuff so it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m42s)

[needed some compute and whatnot but B it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m43s)

[it's mostly a static site it's yeah but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m46s)

[there's a lot that went into this and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m51s)

[arguably a lot of the complications came](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m53s)

[from the fact that the website wasn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m56s)

[the only output format like we had to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m58s)

[generate some stuff for the publisher](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h04m59s)

[content is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m23s)

[used yeah now imagine you don't want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m25s)

[build that index by](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m29s)

[hand and you want it automated we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m32s)

[automated that index](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m35s)

[doing something that means we should be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m54s)

[able to go to tables let's go take a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m56s)

[look at the tables uh sorry it's under](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h05m58s)

[right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m04s)

[there no table uh refresh the schema at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m05s)

[that's good news but yeah depends on how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m25s)

[you look at it uh let's see writing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m27s)

[get the same thing by just hitting my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m50s)

[keyboard so try setting one of these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m53s)

[values to the expected type yeah I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m56s)

[I know what your problem is so let's go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h06m59s)

[take so you've got the fully qualified](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h07m01s)

[yep yep yep yep okay um go back to PG](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h07m04s)

[yeah just for a moment because I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m16s)

[say it may be a mismatch between schema](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m19s)

[postest extension it's at the schema](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m28s)

[level um so you don't get them across](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m30s)

[the board so if you end up in a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m32s)

[different schema that's not like your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m33s)

[default schema you will be missing your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m35s)

[extension and then you have to install](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m38s)

[it again but against a different schema](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m41s)

[what they refer to it as if I'm not mist](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h08m49s)

[what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m00s)

[happens when you go to the connection](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m01s)

[string overload just to be clear right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m03s)

[like so public are you setting a schema](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m06s)

[on your connection string I wouldn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m09s)

[imagine that you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m11s)

[is everything on my connection you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m22s)

[should be all good there then but I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m24s)

[guess my my comment though is when you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m26s)

[do with um this guy here with a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m28s)

[connection string it probably has to new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m31s)

[up one of those config objects and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m34s)

[don't know what this might do it should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m36s)

[just use the defaults uh you are correct](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m39s)

[it appears to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m43s)

[exactly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m45s)

[yeah give me one moment I'm going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m47s)

[take a quick peek at something on yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m49s)

[so it justs up a basic config and sets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m52s)

[connection string property so I'll leave](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m55s)

[it in the full one because it's a little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h09m57s)

[more explicit but they should be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h10m00s)

[identical](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h10m03s)

[yeah oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h10m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h14m57s)

[oh because I made the sweeping](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h15m02s)

[think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h15m07s)

[that the provider may be holding on to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h15m09s)

[query no I think the next step is we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m07s)

[start digging in on how we want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m10s)

[actually do the processing of the data](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m11s)

[so making alterations on how it chunks](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m13s)

[uh how it partitions um you know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m16s)

[determining what's going to be value are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m19s)

[we going to do some pre parsing so that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m21s)

[we only get text inside of our uh our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m23s)

[embeddings because the embeddings of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m26s)

[those time stamps isn't very valuable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m28s)

[unless somebody's going to ask the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m29s)

[question of you know when when or when](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m30s)

[or specifically uh things like you know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m35s)

[on this on stream XYZ what was said at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m39s)

[timestamp blah blah blah you know right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m43s)

[because we we might want to rip that out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m46s)

[of the things that were generating the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m48s)

[embedding from but we still want the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m50s)

[pointer back to where it exists in time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m52s)

[exactly yes and we'll still use that um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m56s)

[in fact we'd take that entire URL and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h17m59s)

[use it as a uh a reference so that when](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m01s)

[we pull this um this embedding with this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m05s)

[data that would then be used by the llm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m09s)

[we could provide that entire reference](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m11s)

[and they'd have a link back to uh the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m12s)

[spe specific video and time at which it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m15s)

[was said um and that gets back to again](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m18s)

[if we want to take all those you know uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m20s)

[parse them such they're one chunk and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m25s)

[then use the top time stamp um yeah I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m26s)

[think that's where we want to go next](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m30s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m32s)

[okay makes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m35s)

[sense and that's where we'll start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m37s)

[getting into the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m39s)

[more uh more interesting rather than the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m41s)

[config for a oneliner yep yep pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m43s)

[much um cuz it can get pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m47s)

[pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m51s)

[deep do you know why like this database](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m52s)

[seems very chatty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h18m56s)

[chatty um I think it's honestly your PG](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m00s)

[admin oh that's good your PG admin's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m04s)

[also connected to it yeah oh so there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m06s)

[no yeah okay that kind of makes sense](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m09s)

[yeah so I mean it's not like it's not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m12s)

[like a lot but and then you also have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m14s)

[things that I want to say that uh the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m16s)

[Azure is doing as well cuz azures you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m19s)

[know doing things exactly what it does](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m22s)

[at any given time I don't know but i' be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m26s)

[willing to bet they have an active](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m28s)

[connection to the database for something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m29s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m32s)

[fair H Milo donet cor is becoming close](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m34s)

[to express](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m37s)

[JS uh absolutely well I guess I should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m38s)

[ask the question is that a good thing or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m42s)

[a bad thing to you and I guess in what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m43s)

[ways do you see it might be another](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m45s)

[one like there's there is a lot that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m49s)

[is I don't want to say converging](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m53s)

[but I don't know searp is definitely uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h19m56s)

[guilty of feature](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m00s)

[Envy but that's what's made it so Fe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m03s)

[feature Rich as well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m06s)

[yeah yeah that is true why do I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m12s)

[okay my modules tab open and it's just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m15s)

[taking up a ton of vertical real estate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m18s)

[with not a lot of value](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m19s)

[ad okay I really want to see this thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m22s)

[hit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m24s)

[somewhere um while that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m25s)

[going I was going to go and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m28s)

[see does this guy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m31s)

[here um have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m35s)

[monitor yeah because it's got like it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m44s)

[hovering at like sixish connections](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m47s)

[yeah the storage is slowly gone up which](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m54s)

[is funny since I don't think we've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m57s)

[inserted anything yet so that storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h20m58s)

[capacity is I think the uh extension I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m02s)

[would yeah have to assume](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m05s)

[added and I do wonder if you're right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m11s)

[that some of these connections are the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m13s)

[Azure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m15s)

[stuff like it's the the weird Pro](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m17s)

[casy there we go we finished that's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m22s)

[good sign now we should be able to go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m24s)

[back to PG vector and see some let the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m27s)

[next file go yeah fire away let's go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m30s)

[take a look at that uh that database](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m34s)

[okay so now if I refresh the sucker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m37s)

[there you go okay default am default and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m40s)

[then do I do do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m44s)

[I what's view data View viewedit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m48s)

[data I don't you don't have that many so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m53s)

[I was going to say I don't know how big](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m56s)

[one of these things is I feel like all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h21m58s)

[rows is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m00s)

[dangerous all right okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m01s)

[so you'll see there in the ID if you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m06s)

[want to expand that out a little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m08s)

[bit that ID is built off of first your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m11s)

[document ID that should be recognizable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m14s)

[and that second part is if I'm not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m16s)

[mistaken a part partition](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m19s)

[ID and that partition ID is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m21s)

[uh I want to just say randomly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m26s)

[generated](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m28s)

[UHS kind of [ __ ] if I was guessing kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m32s)

[of looks yeah it kind of looks gooy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m35s)

[um anyways uh so that's generated to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m38s)

[guarantee uniqueness and then um after](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m42s)

[that you've got your embeddings also](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m45s)

[should be fairly familiar also extreme](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m48s)

[long I just no my scroll bar I just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m50s)

[noticed my scroll bar is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m53s)

[EIG okay and then we've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h22m57s)

[tags tags which is just well-known stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m01s)

[it looks](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m05s)

[like CU it's got a document ID some file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m06s)

[type some parts okay yes but you can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m10s)

[also](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m16s)

[use those tags I'm not mistaken those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m18s)

[are what ends up being the additional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m21s)

[storage so that will be where we place](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m24s)

[uh like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m27s)

[actual oh no that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m29s)

[payload pegs is just additional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m32s)

[information and there are some uses for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m34s)

[those too uh with the oh wow and it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m37s)

[got the whole content in here as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m39s)

[well yes and that's so that when you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m42s)

[reference this you do a uh semantic](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m46s)

[similarity a um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m49s)

[nearest neighbor on it it will grab](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m51s)

[based on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m54s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m55s)

[embedding but you also have the actual](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m56s)

[content that you can use and the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h23m59s)

[payloads there is where you can add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m01s)

[additional things like the URL we can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m04s)

[inject the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m06s)

[URL got it and so it could go to that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m08s)

[specific thing and have that reference](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m10s)

[okay okay I like it I like it I like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m13s)

[it okay so I'm going to let this thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m16s)

[ride for a minute where do you want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m19s)

[go in terms of editing the code next](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m21s)

[honestly I would say we can probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m23s)

[kill it it's not useful at this point we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m25s)

[know the data in there is not going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m27s)

[give us good results I mean we don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m29s)

[know that we haven't actually tested it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m31s)

[but I can tell you with pretty high](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m32s)

[certainty that it's not going to give](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m34s)

[you very good results I it still May](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m35s)

[answer the Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m37s)

[question I don't think it's worth](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m39s)

[checking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m41s)

[though we'll just we'll just assume that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m42s)

[it could probably get Mountain Dew it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m44s)

[said enough I mean unless there's one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m46s)

[stream that you and we luckily got it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m48s)

[and you never said bound do highly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m50s)

[unlikely um you are right it is an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m53s)

[unlikely term yeah pretty pretty rare](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m55s)

[pretty pretty unlikely um so the next](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h24m58s)

[part](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m03s)

[is we're going to change some of the the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m06s)

[steps inside of our pipeline so you you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m09s)

[remember the text file that we had at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m14s)

[the bottom there where it was going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m17s)

[through status and then you had these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m18s)

[different different steps that it went](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m20s)

[through to do this parsing yep so what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m21s)

[we're going to need to do is I believe](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m25s)

[set up our own Handler okay um there is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m28s)

[a markdown Handler that we could try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m33s)

[first um and it has](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m36s)

[some uh some I mean the markdown files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m38s)

[is pretty simple so I imagine it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m41s)

[probably gets eaten by any markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m43s)

[parser worth it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m46s)

[salt probably because like they they it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m47s)

[but does it emphasize what we want it to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m51s)

[emphasize and does it result in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m52s)

[something that's actually useful to us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m54s)

[that's fair right like if I was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m56s)

[pre-processing this file the first thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m57s)

[I do is strip blank](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h25m59s)

[lines because some of the blank lines in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m00s)

[here are only here to make it look nice](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m03s)

[inside a GitHub like that is not a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m05s)

[useful thing and as you can see some of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m08s)

[my older ones left a lot of blank lines](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m10s)

[in there as well whereas the newer](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m13s)

[versions strip it out we could kind of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m15s)

[standardize some of the data as well if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m17s)

[we wanted](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m19s)

[so let's go out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m21s)

[to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m25s)

[uh colel memory orchester yeah so after](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m27s)

[you do your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m30s)

[build let's do a memory](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m32s)

[dot uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m35s)

[orchestrator that change uh well hold on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m42s)

[am I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m45s)

[crazy do that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m48s)

[there there we go it's because I was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m54s)

[going straight to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m56s)

[interface and so we'll still register](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h26m58s)

[with the interface we'll just yep oh uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m00s)

[C loves the Builder pattern yes I will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m03s)

[agree with you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m06s)

[Al like see the kernel memory stuff the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m07s)

[generic host it is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m11s)

[very it is the the love is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m14s)

[strong okay so orchestrator and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m17s)

[what are we doing here so we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m20s)

[add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m23s)

[handlers um those steps are actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m24s)

[handlers that are then um given a step](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m29s)

[name so I want to say let's do uh add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m33s)

[default handlers first and let's go take](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m36s)

[a look at that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m38s)

[method um add default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m39s)

[handlers we'll take a look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m42s)

[yeah okay so this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m46s)

[there's your handlers there's your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m50s)

[steps and based on settings some of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m52s)

[these will and won't uh be a part of it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m55s)

[but we can reuse probably a good portion](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h27m58s)

[of these um I mean it's we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m02s)

[try to do as much reuse as possible at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m05s)

[least to start and then we'll go from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m07s)

[there um got so we we might want to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m09s)

[something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m14s)

[similar right where we we want to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m15s)

[something similar yep so maybe I go down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m17s)

[down here and I go actually you know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m20s)

[what hang on hang on we can be even more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m23s)

[clever oh I can't do static inside of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m26s)

[static yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m30s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m32s)

[um we just do this and we'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m36s)

[go there done that'll work that'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m46s)

[work um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m50s)

[so do these not come with default ones](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m53s)

[already do I need to clear these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m56s)

[initially or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m57s)

[something uh it does it does this just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h28m59s)

[allows you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m02s)

[to um what you can do is up in your uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m03s)

[Builder pattern you could do a DOT](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m09s)

[without default handlers and then this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m10s)

[would allow you to add all those default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m13s)

[handlers back just do it manually oh I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m15s)

[see so I would go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m18s)

[without default handlers got it yep okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m20s)

[and so that's just telling the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m24s)

[orchestrator that we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m24s)

[determine all of the steps that I has to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m25s)

[go through um hands off I want to drive](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m27s)

[give me the exctly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m30s)

[exactly so let's first take a look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m33s)

[at text extraction](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m38s)

[Handler](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m41s)

[okay all right so this go through here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m45s)

[there should be one that takes in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m49s)

[a document request I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m51s)

[say um in file details there's your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m55s)

[extract text extract Json that we saw](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h29m58s)

[out on the blob storage yep pulls in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m01s)

[binary](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m05s)

[data pulls out the text they love their](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m07s)

[value](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m10s)

[tupal it's not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m11s)

[being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m13s)

[skipped we write it out and gen the file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m15s)

[detail](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m19s)

[and then we do save extracted](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m23s)

[contents and rip through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m30s)

[this and then these are the helper](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m34s)

[methods that that thing appears to do it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m36s)

[so extract text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m38s)

[async this potentially what you were](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m40s)

[looking for or takes the file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m42s)

[Contex so what I'm seeing so far as we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m45s)

[go through this is it looks like it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m48s)

[mostly just taking the text out of um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m50s)

[out of the file and uh and just placing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m54s)

[it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m58s)

[elsewhere since this would be intended](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h30m59s)

[to take a like a file upload um it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m01s)

[just doing that and adding some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m05s)

[additional metadata so that you can um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m06s)

[track as it's parsing these or oh yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m09s)

[sentences are complet processing these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m12s)

[would explain why it was dropping on the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m13s)

[periods there you go add a clean page](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m16s)

[separation yep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m18s)

[so that would be where it's dividing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m20s)

[between Pages or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m22s)

[partitions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m24s)

[um so you said there was a markdown one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m26s)

[that might be better to I think there is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m30s)

[a markdown one um if I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m32s)

[do n orchestrator add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m35s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m38s)

[Handler mark down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m41s)

[coder markdown partitioning Handler or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m50s)

[no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m53s)

[markdown the problem is I I I must need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m55s)

[a new get package for it or similar](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m57s)

[because this thing does not appear to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h31m59s)

[have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m01s)

[it um let's go look at let's go look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m03s)

[the options for the text extraction](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m06s)

[Handler does it have options that we can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m09s)

[uh we can affect possibly sorry no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m12s)

[worries just looking at what else was in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m16s)

[here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m18s)

[by default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m20s)

[okay so this guy here if we go and look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m24s)

[at him again uh let's see he has a step](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m27s)

[name uh not exposed on his API](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m35s)

[directly how would you typically pass](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m40s)

[options on one of these handlers are are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m43s)

[they usually like public Properties or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m46s)

[how do they do it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m48s)

[I honestly have not passed uh options](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m50s)

[into these before so um the way that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m53s)

[I've handled it in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m56s)

[past uh me go open my example so I can I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h32m58s)

[don't see anything that's jumping out at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m03s)

[me I can check on this extension and see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m05s)

[but it doesn't look](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m09s)

[like it looks like you're kind of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m11s)

[limited here the only time I've done](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m13s)

[options it looks like is on custom](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m15s)

[handlers that I've built um so they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m16s)

[don't have that in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m20s)

[there yeah yeah and these appear to just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m23s)

[be going into the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m26s)

[DI default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m28s)

[yeah and they'll get picked up by](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m30s)

[obviously by the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m34s)

[subsequent orchestration](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m36s)

[runs um okay so what do you so maybe we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m39s)

[want to maybe we want to do our own](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m43s)

[Handler or we could start out by doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m47s)

[yeah doing our own Handler to transition](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m52s)

[the file from the state that it's in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m55s)

[into a state that's going to give us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m57s)

[valuable data so I would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h33m58s)

[say doing an extraction that instead of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m01s)

[uh breaking on periods doing that clean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m05s)

[sentence we do something where it takes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m07s)

[it in um takes all of the actual pieces](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m09s)

[of content pens those together uh and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m12s)

[takes that first um Prim stamp](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m22s)

[then I just do the interface](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m24s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m29s)

[yes you can just do the interface](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m30s)

[that'll need a orchestrator](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m33s)

[a well we can add options here if we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m37s)

[wanted to make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m39s)

[it just do something to kind to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m41s)

[this yes poach always forget that you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m44s)

[the master of just like going and cop](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m48s)

[and pasting I I mean I I always find](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m49s)

[myself just stumbling through figuring](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m53s)

[it out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m55s)

[yeah um let's see don't care don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h34m56s)

[care I mean I guess it's it's Pro](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m03s)

[probably doesn't hurt to add in the log](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m05s)

[and stuff while we're while we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m07s)

[here make it make it mirror that a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m10s)

[little bit and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m13s)

[then do this do this do this change the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m17s)

[target for the logger to make it proper](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m22s)

[one this guy goes away this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m26s)

[becomes private readon I logger](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m29s)

[of yeah thank you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m34s)

[co-pilot a wonderful](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m37s)

[audience okay and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m40s)

[then you want to save off the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m43s)

[orchestrator we'll definitely need that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m45s)

[I don't think that we'll need the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m48s)

[content](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m50s)

[decoders](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m52s)

[um perfectly fine nuke and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h35m57s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m01s)

[uh oh this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m05s)

[interesting actually I I would argue a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m13s)

[bug in the existing stuff so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m18s)

[yeah but you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m24s)

[know some people may disagree to each](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m26s)

[their own as they say okay so I've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m30s)

[this I've got this I've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m33s)

[this now I assume I can look kind of at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m35s)

[what they did here on their invoke async](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m38s)

[and kind of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m41s)

[do I would copy a good portion of that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m42s)

[what a lot of that kind of uh additional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m45s)

[stuff there is is handling all of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m49s)

[the creating your step files so like we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m53s)

[saw where you had um your extracted text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h36m57s)

[and then you had your embeddings and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m00s)

[then you had um well I don't think you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m02s)

[had a third step there because your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m05s)

[third step was just uploading um but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m06s)

[there are uh additional files that get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m09s)

[generated and so we can generate a step](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m11s)

[file to say as we're going through this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m14s)

[document or this partition um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m17s)

[check that uh that file off we've gone](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m20s)

[all the way through this file we don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m22s)

[need to re pick up that job um and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m24s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m29s)

[yeah the queue if you do a like an event](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m31s)

[Hub style queue instead of a simple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m34s)

[queue you can end up with um jobs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m36s)

[actually posting out into a queue and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m40s)

[being picked up by different workers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m43s)

[that run through the orchestration](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m44s)

[steps got it okay now this thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m46s)

[here two array do length](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h37m57s)

[Yu um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m04s)

[no I'm I'm GNA I'm going to propose](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m10s)

[let's not allocate a massive array for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m13s)

[no purpose um okay then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m15s)

[strip the web page one cuz we aren't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m18s)

[doing that stuff so I really only need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m21s)

[that now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m24s)

[yeah uh let's see that goes like that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m26s)

[that goes like that that goes like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m28s)

[that okay and then we're going to go up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m40s)

[here and then I just need the extract](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m45s)

[text bit then this is where I assume we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m48s)

[get fancy and do our bits rather than](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m51s)

[their](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m54s)

[bits yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h38m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m02s)

[yes it's actually funny because so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m09s)

[there's the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m12s)

[decoders but I think what we're saying](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m13s)

[is we don't need that right we know our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m16s)

[file type coming in we're always going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m19s)

[to have marked down we're not processing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m21s)

[anything else so we can actually do a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m23s)

[lot of restrictions on yeah uh dealing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m25s)

[with the different mime types and uh and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m28s)

[such we aren't going to deal with any of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m33s)

[garbage so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m34s)

[uh yeah we're going to do that hey](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m36s)

[Society dog good morning to you as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m39s)

[well okay so here uh we are building out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m43s)

[a we'll call it a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m47s)

[I've done if that doesn't terrify the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m56s)

[rest of the internet I don't know what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h39m59s)

[does um okay so I'm trying to look and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m01s)

[see this is doing decoder and all of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m04s)

[this stuff but at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m06s)

[it's just trying to get a string back](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m08s)

[out that's right so this is a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m10s)

[work to get text and what is this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m14s)

[because this is the original text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m18s)

[yep oh yeah no problem I I was glad to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m21s)

[see that there was a lot of action on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m24s)

[that post too and feedback it it was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m26s)

[kind of cool I I learned something about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m29s)

[Avalon I didn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m30s)

[know um for our file content](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m32s)

[Casey we're always marked down markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m37s)

[old](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m40s)

[one oh I see got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m41s)

[it the old stuff okay got it old mine](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m44s)

[types yep so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m47s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m49s)

[this because that's what we want and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m51s)

[then we just want to read said file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m54s)

[right so uploaded](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h40m57s)

[file we fed it a stream somewhere didn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m02s)

[oh wait we've got file content right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m04s)

[there file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m07s)

[content and then they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m10s)

[aren't they broke it into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m13s)

[sections yep and we're going to want do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m17s)

[much the same so do I actually want the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m20s)

[decoders](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m23s)

[then because they were point out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m25s)

[decoders based upon mind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m27s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m35s)

[type because I don't have it's a good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m37s)

[question because they like they pull the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m40s)

[decoder out do the decode and then this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m43s)

[gives them back this thing that had has](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m46s)

[apparently chunked stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m50s)

[already CU well it's yeah it's broken it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m52s)

[into those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m56s)

[partitions um yeah because how does how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h41m57s)

[does file content](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m00s)

[no they get file content and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m02s)

[something populates these sections and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m05s)

[have to believe it's this decode](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m07s)

[async because they get one of these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m10s)

[suckers with you might be right uh I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m12s)

[not familiar with the the decoders](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m16s)

[uh extract contents from the given](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m20s)

[file and but the problem is is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m24s)

[that if we go down so well but doesn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m27s)

[this that gives us mean that we could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m31s)

[write our own decoder register it for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m33s)

[the right mime](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m37s)

[type and then it'll get picked up but we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m39s)

[won't need to write our own file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m41s)

[extractor we could just write our own](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m44s)

[decoder h](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m47s)

[yeah that so as long as it's picking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m51s)

[that up from di yeah so I that should be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m54s)

[the case I think what I can do we can we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h42m58s)

[can test this there oh yeah it does get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m01s)

[the IE](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m03s)

[content public class my markdown decoder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m05s)

[right and I do this I do this I wish I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m10s)

[knew their existing ones I don't know it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m13s)

[would it would help to know how to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m15s)

[implement this Tucker um let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m18s)

[decode decode decode supports mime type](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m22s)

[so I think what we want to do is return](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m25s)

[M type equals markdown right if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m28s)

[it and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m31s)

[then the files that we feed in I think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m34s)

[they were being detected as marked down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m37s)

[anyway right I think I think yes I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m39s)

[to say in the one of those log files we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m43s)

[saw it as marked down I thought even](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m45s)

[right here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m48s)

[yeah may say it in the tags as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m50s)

[well yeah but scroll bar is too](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m55s)

[tiny](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h43m59s)

[um it's going to be where tags](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m03s)

[was the problem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m06s)

[is yeah Vector is e big](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m09s)

[oh there it is file type text Mark down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m12s)

[Mar down yeah so it's it's coming](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m15s)

[through here as text markdown so that'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m18s)

[that'll pick this up and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m21s)

[then because it's grabbing the last one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m24s)

[so the last one registered gets to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m26s)

[win right and then can I do something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m29s)

[like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m32s)

[with content](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m33s)

[decoder there you go nice I win I win I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m37s)

[win I'm guessing I can just implement](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m41s)

[this one right because using](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m43s)

[VAR uh uh reader gets new stream reader](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m47s)

[boom uh read to end](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m52s)

[async await](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h44m56s)

[right return](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m00s)

[new uh oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m03s)

[yeah content MIM type](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m13s)

[how do I put the content into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m23s)

[it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m25s)

[sections right and so this is where then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m28s)

[I do work to get the sections out yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m30s)

[right uh file content.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m34s)

[sections](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m37s)

[file see by not naming it properly it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m40s)

[confused the co-pilot](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m43s)

[AI author not naming to make the AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m49s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m52s)

[um this goes here this goes here and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m56s)

[then what is a file section number](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h45m59s)

[content sentences are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m01s)

[complete that's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m04s)

[weird is that's just an auto](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m07s)

[incrementing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m09s)

[int text right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m10s)

[through right what is the sentences our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m14s)

[complete reference](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m16s)

[then we could just you know collection](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m19s)

[initialization simplification boom done](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m21s)

[right so we got to we got to do some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m23s)

[work actually get the content yeah so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m26s)

[and then doing the the chunking of it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m31s)

[and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m33s)

[similar because we have to then build up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m34s)

[this list of file sections](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m36s)

[so um we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m41s)

[can subtitle converter](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m44s)

[where is my thingy my bobber that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m50s)

[actually so my the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m53s)

[entire process that converts this into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h46m57s)

[this markdown can be summarized in three](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m00s)

[rexes that is the sum total of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m05s)

[entire thing right and you'll note it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m08s)

[prefixes with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m11s)

[this right and then it does this that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m14s)

[that is is it that is the whole](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m18s)

[thing so it's like and arguably most](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m22s)

[human beings don't don't do this right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m26s)

[like that's weird and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m27s)

[ugly but the output](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m30s)

[it's that but the output is bad I mean](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m32s)

[it's not really legible as a Rex oh come](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m36s)

[on but is any really Rex so hang on we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m40s)

[we just want to do this right so and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m44s)

[then we want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m45s)

[do uh Let's see we want to do turn](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m47s)

[reject on I want to match from start of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m51s)

[line do a curly brace I want to do a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m54s)

[pattern match group I want it to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m57s)

[named uh text I want it to be all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h47m59s)

[characters that are not a closing slash](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m04s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m09s)

[set](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m11s)

[um uh any number of repetitions close](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m12s)

[group close thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m16s)

[um like that and then we could honestly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m21s)

[I don't know if we care about the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m25s)

[URL uh because we could do something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m27s)

[like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m29s)

[um see I don't understand why people](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m31s)

[think this is UN unreadable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m34s)

[URL uh dot](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m37s)

[star close](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m41s)

[group uh what did I mess up here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m46s)

[valid regular expression maybe this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m50s)

[why people think these things are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m51s)

[unreadable might be might have something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m54s)

[to do that it goes like that and this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m56s)

[should actually be all characters that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h48m58s)

[are not equal to closing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m02s)

[pen uh any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m06s)

[followed by uh a closing pen clearly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m09s)

[needs to be escaped right so there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m13s)

[there's your redx like I I mean that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m15s)

[all it takes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m17s)

[that that's it it's not that big of a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m19s)

[deal right so copy paste right and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m20s)

[then and then we come over where was I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m25s)

[see now I've lost my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m29s)

[place we go here all right so if I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m31s)

[wanted to break these things apart right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m33s)

[so I would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m36s)

[go Rex match right there's my text there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m37s)

[is my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m44s)

[pattern right and now I've got a set of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m47s)

[yeah WTF easy right so what's your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m51s)

[output of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m55s)

[that uh for each match match in oh I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h49m56s)

[sorry I want this to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m02s)

[matches right boom because I'm G to have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m04s)

[a so so now I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m07s)

[got uh have a great side that explains](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m10s)

[how that works](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m14s)

[um yeah actually there's there's a few](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m15s)

[of them that really good yeah the on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m18s)

[breaking down red Jack yeah the one I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m20s)

[think I've used](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m22s)

[most I I can never remember the right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m24s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m27s)

[one is it that yeah that one this this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m28s)

[one this one I like a lot because you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m31s)

[can take your redx yeah and drop it in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m34s)

[right and then this actually goes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m38s)

[through the redx and tries to break down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m40s)

[the order of what's Happening](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m43s)

[Here like it's remarkable how much you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m45s)

[can do with red X only memorize at a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m47s)

[handful of patterns yeah it is oh hold](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m49s)

[on XKCD Rex the this is this is required](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h50m53s)

[reading for all people who do who who do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m00s)

[Rex](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m03s)

[so enjoy that is that is that is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m05s)

[required reading for all rejects because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m08s)

[there is way too much truth in that it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m10s)

[a good one okay so now we have this and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m13s)

[then more importantly I can go string uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m16s)

[uh I don't know line equals match groups](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m19s)

[text. value and yes I am aware we have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m24s)

[compiled reject and I can make this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m27s)

[faster and blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m29s)

[there see look at that I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m31s)

[win um is it gonna is it going to auto](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m32s)

[code for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m36s)

[me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m37s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m42s)

[match](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m44s)

[um why](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m47s)

[Rex okay fine we'll you we'll use the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m50s)

[compiled Rex there happy you've appeased](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m52s)

[the uh the vs Gods so for people who](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h51m58s)

[don't know what just happened it created](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m01s)

[an attribute a partial method this then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m03s)

[gets implemented at compile time with a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m06s)

[very I'll say a more performant Rex](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m11s)

[engine because it doesn't have to have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m14s)

[the ho of Rex it can parse this and do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m16s)

[do it at compile time so if your pattern](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m18s)

[is compile time constant you can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m20s)

[leverage this to get a decent](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m22s)

[performance bump out of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m23s)

[it and syntax highlight and all that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m25s)

[jazz](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m28s)

[Okay Okay so we've got these groups and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m29s)

[then how how do we want to determine](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m33s)

[these sections I guess is the question](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m36s)

[because I now have the URL yanked out of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m38s)

[that I now have the line yanked out of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m41s)

[that I could pull we know that the lines](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m43s)

[are roughly 3 seconds each like we could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m46s)

[make that as an assumption and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m48s)

[pull what 21](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m52s)

[seconds 18 seconds what like are we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m55s)

[worried about like the Contex size of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h52m59s)

[one of these things I mean it it depends](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m01s)

[I mean what what do we look like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m04s)

[lengthwise when uh when we do hit it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m06s)

[does have Mountain Dew right in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m10s)

[opener also that beginning you'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m12s)

[probably want to take off the first one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m15s)

[I don't know if you already did that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m17s)

[uh I did not but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m19s)

[um also give me one second I'll be right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m23s)

[back](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m25s)

[reader uh read line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m27s)

[async uh let's see here we'll leave a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m31s)

[comment because future Kevin's not going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m34s)

[to remember why he did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m36s)

[this uh let's see here and then that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m39s)

[should also have the cancellation](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m42s)

[token throw away the header](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m44s)

[line actually I don't think we're going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m50s)

[to pick it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m53s)

[up oh no we will because it matches it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h53m57s)

[it does match the Rex pattern](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m01s)

[okay so we'll throw we'll throw it away](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m03s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m06s)

[we'll rip through this and in reality](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m07s)

[what we probably shouldn't be doing is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m10s)

[read to end is we should probably read](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m11s)

[individually and build these up as we go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m14s)

[but at the end of the day these five](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m16s)

[sections are going to contain the string](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m18s)

[content anyway](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m27s)

[um so I guess in my naive sense](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m31s)

[here my gut reaction says](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m35s)

[to group these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m39s)

[things because the the subtitles don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m44s)

[usually pick up like sentence breaks or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m47s)

[any of that stuff and you'll know there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m49s)

[are a handful of things where like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m51s)

[clearly I said Sam yeah and goo like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m53s)

[Microsoft stuff is much more hip to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m57s)

[picking up zamel as lingo like I wonder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h54m59s)

[why and the Google is ones are not but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m03s)

[it does it does pick up my like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m06s)

[Google translate does do better at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m09s)

[picking up my fake words that aren't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m11s)

[real words and going here's what I know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m12s)

[you meant it's not a real word but let](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m15s)

[me just plug that in for you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m18s)

[like so we'll call that good yeah so I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m20s)

[kind of wondering because what is what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m24s)

[is the right way to determine how big my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m28s)

[file section should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m30s)

[be like what what are the pros and cons](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m32s)

[of like dumping because I could dump it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m35s)

[all in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m36s)

[one right that's probably wrong and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m38s)

[could jump every little word in one that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m40s)

[might be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m43s)

[wrong I personally unless I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m44s)

[something very](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m47s)

[uh uh contextual that I can use so like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m48s)

[um I've used like headings in markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m53s)

[if I have different sections try to grab](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m57s)

[the heading first and then I will cut](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h55m59s)

[that down to whatever size I can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m02s)

[actually fit into uh into the embedding](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m04s)

[model so start out with grabbing it all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m07s)

[let's take a look at it let's see how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m09s)

[long it is um because it's kind of hard](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m12s)

[to judge that based on I mean we could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m15s)

[do some some rough math it was like a 64](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m17s)

[something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m22s)

[sections each one of those looked like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m23s)

[it was six to seven](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m25s)

[words uh token is three to four](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m28s)

[characters uh there's there's some rough](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m33s)

[math you could do I can tell you about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m35s)

[how long it is but I would start by just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m37s)

[joining it all together let's take a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m39s)

[look at how long it is and then we'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m40s)

[take a look at what the maximum context](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m42s)

[length uh or the maximum input is for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m46s)

[the a to2 embedding model and actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m49s)

[I'll start looking at that while](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m51s)

[you get that so I'm going to get this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m54s)

[guy going I don't want the custom markup](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h56m57s)

[one which he's not in there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m01s)

[anymore where are these three references](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m03s)

[I just want to make sure I didn't do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m05s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m06s)

[stupid so we don't think we need that um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m07s)

[and more importantly you have a compiler](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m10s)

[so I'm just going to make you go away](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m12s)

[because I think we can get away with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m13s)

[this I'm going to do this here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m14s)

[and I am going to send it with just this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m19s)

[one and see what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m25s)

[happens okay so ingest try it out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m33s)

[go I should have a break point right at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m38s)

[the beginning](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m41s)

[to hope I'm realizing I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m42s)

[left it there or not I did I killed all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m45s)

[my break points](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m48s)

[hold going I do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m50s)

[this CU I want to make sure it grabs the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m52s)

[right one I'm going to close down these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m55s)

[tabs because I've clearly lost](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m56s)

[myself and then you're going into your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h57m58s)

[own file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m01s)

[because you're just you're causing me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m02s)

[confusion and then I want a break point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m04s)

[here here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m06s)

[here just to make Uber sure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m10s)

[okay there try it out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m18s)

[execute okay first](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m28s)

[file it is the short one esk I just want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m31s)

[to make sure that that's where I ended](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m35s)

[it it did not grab the one I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m39s)

[expected ien](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m45s)

[B](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m48s)

[FB so here's what we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m52s)

[do uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m56s)

[where x. path get file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h58m59s)

[name x equals equals there I'm going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m05s)

[make it real obvious which one you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m09s)

[allowed to be we're going to take the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m10s)

[first three that all have this file name](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m13s)

[I'm real confident what I'm about to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m20s)

[get I would hope so and also I think we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m23s)

[oh we'd have to move there we go now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m28s)

[we're now we're only acting on the small](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m31s)

[one so now we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m33s)

[execute oh oh yeah binary data is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m38s)

[actually what's being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m42s)

[invoked not the stream okay so I I got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m45s)

[to I got to refactor this a little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m48s)

[okay um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m51s)

[data you know it's the greatest thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m54s)

[for me with all of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=02h59m57s)

[Kevin it's been a while since I've gone](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h00m00s)

[through and did uh couple months and all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h00m02s)

[the stuff I had going on uh I honestly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h00m07s)

[don't remember exactly how to do this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h00m10s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m13s)

[that's too deep though I mean you've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m14s)

[seen seen the email](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m17s)

[ones yeah okay so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m18s)

[1693 character](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m22s)

[count](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m25s)

[okay and then it it promptly passed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m28s)

[1693 but bear in mind you need to split](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m32s)

[that into at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m34s)

[least probably three to well well that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m36s)

[character count not word count uh three](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m39s)

[to four](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m42s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m43s)

[characters yeah you could probably fit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m45s)

[that into one so but bear in mind that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m47s)

[is a 4K file yeah that we just did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m50s)

[versus](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m54s)

[my if we sort by](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m56s)

[size I mean my biggest is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h04m59s)

[450 yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m03s)

[so that brings us to the problem with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m06s)

[uh the problem with doing a whole file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m12s)

[obviously we're not going to fit a whole](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m15s)

[file in there which means we do indeed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m16s)

[have to chunk yeah um so I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m18s)

[imagining we do something along the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m21s)

[lines](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m23s)

[of uh let's see list file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m25s)

[section uh sections](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m30s)

[gets new right something like that this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m33s)

[then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m37s)

[becomes uh sections and then we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m38s)

[go uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m43s)

[see you Society](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m49s)

[dog fun at work we will definitely have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m51s)

[fun this is probably going to be a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m54s)

[continuation a little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m56s)

[um so what kind of length do you think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h05m59s)

[we want to break on because I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m03s)

[thinking we just run until our string](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m04s)

[Builder exceeds a particular length and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m07s)

[then throw that into a section so it's a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m09s)

[good way to start uh especially since we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m12s)

[know that the lines are not individual](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m15s)

[sentences or anything like that section](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m17s)

[length what what do you think is a good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m20s)

[value well I wouldn't go based on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m23s)

[characters I would go based on tokens so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m26s)

[how do I know the token count we need a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m29s)

[token counter you should be able to get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m31s)

[uh the default GPT tokenizer um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m35s)

[so that I think you're going to need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m41s)

[using](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m48s)

[microsoft. kernel memory. a.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m49s)

[openai let's see so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m55s)

[using](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h06m58s)

[Microsoft memory AI open](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m01s)

[AI that should give you open AI or Azure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m06s)

[open AI uh just open AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m09s)

[okay now you should be able to get uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m15s)

[default tokenizer do static token](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m18s)

[counter default what tokenizer default](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m27s)

[GPT](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m31s)

[tokenizer yeah dot](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m33s)

[static uh oh do static count tokens yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m38s)

[and then I can feed it text got it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m42s)

[okay got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m45s)

[down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m48s)

[here I basically want to do something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m50s)

[like this where I go int token count](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m52s)

[well uh let's see int token count get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h07m57s)

[zero yes I'm aware this isn't going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m02s)

[work but we'll fix it in a minute token](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m04s)

[count plus](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m06s)

[equals the line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m08s)

[right yep that would do it is it a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m10s)

[problem that I'm appending a space](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m14s)

[is that going to affect the token count](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m17s)

[significantly do we care no it won't it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m19s)

[won't affect the token count](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m22s)

[significantly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m23s)

[and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m26s)

[uh I don't think you'll need I I don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m28s)

[know go to the go to the transcript](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m31s)

[again real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m33s)

[quick if you if it ends is we're that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m34s)

[and then you don't get yeah you don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m39s)

[get us free space so yeah definitely add](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m41s)

[the space](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m42s)

[back so I actually want to do line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m44s)

[plus space here right and then I would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m48s)

[agree then I do this right yep and so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m51s)

[that that ends back in there yep so uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m54s)

[what is our Max token length that we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h08m59s)

[going for here to 20 48 I want to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m02s)

[let double check](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m08s)

[my brain](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m09s)

[here uh no uh yeah 2040 or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m12s)

[we're Ada of version two so actually no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m18s)

[the max token is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m21s)

[8,191](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m24s)

[8,191 yes is there a reason I don't just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m27s)

[do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m29s)

[8,000 it's up to you buffer really it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m32s)

[doesn't matter um yeah I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m36s)

[mean yes you can go with a lower Max](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m39s)

[token length you could then use those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m42s)

[extra tokens to add context from a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m44s)

[previous section or you could even trim](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m46s)

[this down further if you want to break](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m48s)

[the content up smaller so one of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m49s)

[other things to keep in mind is that as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m52s)

[we do the other side of this your mod or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m54s)

[your Bot is going to be pulling out it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h09m58s)

[going to be using the query from from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m01s)

[the user um doing an embedding against](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m03s)

[that and doing the similarity search](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m06s)

[against all of these embeddings in our](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m08s)

[database so do you want that to come](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m10s)

[back with only one result and it would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m13s)

[just just be one big result or do you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m17s)

[want to come back with like five smaller](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m19s)

[results that may get content from](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m22s)

[multiple different streams you know what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m24s)

[I mean um and then how efficient do you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m26s)

[want it to be on uh getting enough](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m29s)

[context to answer the question while](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m32s)

[also not costing an arm and a leg in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m34s)

[tokens going to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m36s)

[llm I generally find that smaller is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m38s)

[better but not too small you don't want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m43s)

[to be on individual sentences I think I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m45s)

[think if you could get to like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m47s)

[paragraphs or like halves of paragraphs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m49s)

[that's better in my opinion yeah but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m51s)

[it's also not set up that way because I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m53s)

[don't yeah I don't have I don't have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m55s)

[paragraphs or punctuation in a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h10m57s)

[cases so finding the end of sentences](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m00s)

[and finding the end of paragraphs is a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m02s)

[little more difficult in that regard yep](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m04s)

[so if we go something like this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m08s)

[right maybe we dial it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m12s)

[Downer let's go with yeah let's start](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m15s)

[with like 4,000 or this is g to be exact](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m18s)

[right because I'm waiting until I go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m21s)

[over but I'm also leveraging the fact](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m22s)

[that I know that each of these lines](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m25s)

[isn't going to have a huge number of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m26s)

[tokens yeah right like this is going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m28s)

[get itself down fairly small but the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m30s)

[other thing that I'm going to do is I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m33s)

[going to get rid of this knowing that it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m34s)

[won't land on that file if I do it right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m36s)

[it'll hit something bigger and then we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m39s)

[will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m41s)

[go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m44s)

[here and I I already got a break point](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m45s)

[okay there were compile AES no there are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m48s)

[not compile](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m50s)

[AES what did I do wrong no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m52s)

[semic am I an idiot where is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h11m57s)

[this oh I am an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m00s)

[idiot uh no not an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m04s)

[idiot I will say the redx has a nice](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m08s)

[side effect of deleting all the blank](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m10s)

[lines too by the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m12s)

[way yeah the blank lines don't match the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m14s)

[Rex so I have trim I secretly trimmed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m16s)

[out all of the empty lines without](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m19s)

[having to trim out all the empty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m21s)

[lines uh I should have probably looked](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m23s)

[at how big this stream data](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m26s)

[is so this thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m29s)

[has 100,000 right so we are not going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m31s)

[step through all of these I'm just kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m34s)

[of curious so token count on that line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m36s)

[was seven right so we're going to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m38s)

[4,000 in a little bit is probably where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m41s)

[it's going to land I'm going to let it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m44s)

[roll okay what did we come up with four](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m45s)

[sections](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m49s)

[okay okay you want to open that up wider](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m52s)

[let's let's take a a quick Gander at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m55s)

[that sure get the full view so there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h12m57s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m02s)

[content so that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m03s)

[is so that feels too big to me probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m05s)

[that feels huge like I almost want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m10s)

[to quarter that is my thought](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m13s)

[let's try a thousand I like that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m17s)

[idea let's dial that sucker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m19s)

[down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m23s)

[relaunch is there ever a benefit to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m27s)

[putting the same](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m29s)

[content like because you had mentioned](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m32s)

[before about at the break points where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m34s)

[you like overlap like the end of one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m36s)

[section overlaps the beginning of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m39s)

[next right I think that's what you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m41s)

[driving at and you may even see results](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m43s)

[in this kind of context than you would](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m47s)

[in like a like a typical regularly or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m49s)

[normally structured uh file so like with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m51s)

[normal paragraphs and sentences because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m54s)

[this has zero context of what the end of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m56s)

[a thought is or the end of a you know uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h13m59s)

[a diet tride is uh than normal documents](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m02s)

[do um I a stream of Consciousness well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m06s)

[you know any moment of that stream is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m10s)

[probably at least referentially](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m13s)

[correlated to the the moment before and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m17s)

[the moment after I think that depends on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m19s)

[how much Mountain Dew I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m20s)

[had so what I would almost maybe think](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m22s)

[about doing is actually breaking it up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m25s)

[if we wanted to get these down to like a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m27s)

[quarter of the size actually do 500](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m28s)

[sized](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m32s)

[chunks but with 20 with half of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m34s)

[chunk before it and half of the chunk](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m37s)

[after](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m39s)

[it got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m40s)

[it and that also feels pretty big too](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m43s)

[yeah this might even be too big as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m45s)

[well so maybe total size should be more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m48s)

[in the realm of like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m52s)

[250 with maybe an overlap of 100 on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m55s)

[either side or something or 50 on either](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h14m59s)

[side 50 on either side 25 on either side](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m01s)

[maybe yeah the problem is is then I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m04s)

[to go and like keep track of that versus](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m06s)

[the hard brakes now because the risk](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m09s)

[here with the hard brakes is that it may](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m10s)

[lose things that are right at the brakes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m12s)

[right it's not going to have knowledge](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m14s)

[on both sides es so yep we might we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m16s)

[might do the overlap in an effort to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m20s)

[clean that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m23s)

[up a look at this we're now up to 57](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m30s)

[sections that feels a little more](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m35s)

[manageable we going to look in because](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m41s)

[things it should be easy to fix](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m44s)

[quite frankly oh this was a hospital](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m48s)

[night oh this was a sleep study I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m53s)

[remember this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m56s)

[night I remember this the sleeping on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h15m58s)

[what felt like a sheet of plywood I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m01s)

[remember that night when your kid gets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m03s)

[asleep study you don't get the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m05s)

[comfortable bed yeah yeah you're not you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m06s)

[get the you get the what's sitting in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m10s)

[the corner part of the room he got the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m12s)

[comfortable bed he slept well I did not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m14s)

[good he probably needed to sleep well](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m17s)

[yeah something about not being the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m20s)

[patient something something something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m23s)

[you know something like that um okay so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m24s)

[this feels decent feels decent um now we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m27s)

[can add in handling uh the overlap if we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m34s)

[want um I think I'm going to do I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m38s)

[going to do this I'm going to put in a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m41s)

[to-do and then we can Circle back to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m43s)

[this uh to do overlap the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m45s)

[sections um so and I'm going to rename](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m53s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m57s)

[to SRT markdown](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h16m58s)

[decoder it's a little more clear what go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m01s)

[into file content and see what's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m05s)

[available to us real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m06s)

[quick file content file section or file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m09s)

[content um file content has very little](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m13s)

[go to file section see what's in file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m17s)

[section for us file section has this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m19s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m22s)

[here uh yeah and this was the part this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m24s)

[was the reason why I ended up going at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m28s)

[the the Handler level and doing some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m31s)

[different stuff and actually and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m34s)

[partially the Handler level no yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m37s)

[actually absolutely the Handler level so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m40s)

[the problem with the decoder is that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m42s)

[especially in um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m45s)

[content like this you're losing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m47s)

[context so where are your URLs going oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m50s)

[hang on this might S I was looking at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m54s)

[the description here this kind of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m57s)

[handles the overlap](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h17m59s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m05s)

[yes so because I intentionally set](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m06s)

[sentence complete to false so there it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m09s)

[knows these things are going to run](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m11s)

[together that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m14s)

[I almost want my AI to figure out where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m17s)

[my sentences go I need AI for my AI I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m20s)

[need AI to pre-process the input to my](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m23s)

[AI oh you could certainly do that well I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m25s)

[don't doubt it the question is do should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m27s)

[I um probably not not yet that's another](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m31s)

[one of those ones where I would run it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m35s)

[like this first run the easy Bare Bones](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m37s)

[and then you could if you wanted to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m39s)

[Benchmark it run it with sentence](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m42s)

[division Benchmark it again see how it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m44s)

[performs go the uh the data scientist](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m48s)

[way you know that sounds like work it it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m51s)

[is it is in fact work sorry I cut you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m55s)

[off you were trying to to emphasize](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m57s)

[something about why the Handler and not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h18m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m01s)

[parser yeah so the problem is is that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m02s)

[what you return and and this is why I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m05s)

[was going to ask you to look at file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m07s)

[content go back to file content real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m08s)

[quick and see what we get in file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m10s)

[content we don't get a little lot](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m13s)

[I'm typing some prean sections yeah so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m17s)

[the problem is is that where where do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m20s)

[our URLs go we lose the URLs going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m22s)

[through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m24s)

[this uh which is where this guy here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m26s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m30s)

[had was what was the return out of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m32s)

[guy because he was doing file content](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m34s)

[he's he's doing the same thing he's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m37s)

[returning back text file content skip](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m40s)

[file so he doesn't even have it so where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m43s)

[he does](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m47s)

[not so how do I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m48s)

[get is it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m52s)

[here kind of nice I can just jump in and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m55s)

[look at](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h19m57s)

[these chunk header this feels like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m01s)

[something that is going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m04s)

[have allow override to the number](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m10s)

[tokens please tell me this hang](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m18s)

[on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m22s)

[yes so so it works for me without me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m26s)

[having to do anything that makes me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m29s)

[happy it does but it what I'm confused](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m31s)

[by uh a piece of this that I do not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m35s)

[remember is that you are doing some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m38s)

[chunking in the extractor too it seems](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m41s)

[you're at least breaking it down into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m46s)

[smaller pieces yeah in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m48s)

[extractor as opposed to the partitioner](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m52s)

[because this guy comes in here gets the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m55s)

[context gets custom](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h20m57s)

[file partition sentences and this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m20s)

[where it starts to what we should do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m23s)

[oh trust me the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m31s)

[when I don't think you'll have a lot I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m34s)

[don't think you'll have a lot of luck](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m36s)

[with that markdown chunker okay yours is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m38s)

[not complex markdown but you also have a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m42s)

[a unique uh use case](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m44s)

[um everyone has a unique use](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m47s)

[case I mean this is fair this is fair](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m50s)

[go so what I ended up doing let me just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h21m59s)

[let me just roll this back a little bit](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m01s)

[I ended up using the default text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m03s)

[extractor I don't remember it breaking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m05s)

[any of my markdown down um down down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m08s)

[down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m12s)

[um because after that I then used a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m14s)

[custom partitioning Handler um very much](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m17s)

[the same as their text partition Handler](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m21s)

[but uh just handling markdown and doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m24s)

[some uh more context informed um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m28s)

[chunking the problem that I have still](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m35s)

[is that you're ending up with an odd](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m38s)

[number of files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m41s)

[unless why is an odd number of files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m44s)

[weird um because this thing here appears](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m48s)

[that the death generated file details](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m51s)

[appears to have what we expect](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m53s)

[right yeah so go go to your storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m56s)

[account I think I think what happened is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h22m59s)

[that I got confused because again it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m01s)

[been a while so you go into your storage](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m04s)

[account you're going to have all of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m06s)

[those uh chunks those partitions and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m08s)

[then you're also going to have your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m12s)

[embeddings and you should have some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m15s)

[additional files and one of those files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m17s)

[is going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m18s)

[be what was extracted and is the output](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m20s)

[of the text extraction Handler and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m23s)

[think that Yep this guy here yeah so go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m25s)

[on](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m29s)

[that download that and this is what got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m30s)

[me I forgot about](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m33s)

[this yeah so this is the cleaned up text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m37s)

[which is I think it's so I think there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m41s)

[still some value in this being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m43s)

[the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m47s)

[text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m51s)

[yes do we want to handle do we want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m55s)

[handle any kind of chunking at or uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h23m58s)

[processing at the extraction step or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m01s)

[would you want to handle it as a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m02s)

[separate step I would tend to think a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m04s)

[separate step we would just move some of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m06s)

[this work over to a different Handler](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m08s)

[um I don't know um interesting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m13s)

[okay I mean in theory you could do all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m17s)

[of this in one Handler but it defeats](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m20s)

[the purpose of having steps and breaking](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m22s)

[it into smaller uh smaller work products](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m24s)

[small chunks](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m27s)

[yeah and this guy here sorry I was just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m32s)

[trying to to make sure I I understood](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m35s)

[this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m37s)

[the new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m40s)

[files is what is addiction AR that they](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m42s)

[create adds the things](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m48s)

[in uploaded](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m53s)

[file is being iterated over the pipeline](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h24m57s)

[file so they are mutating the thing that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m00s)

[came in via the context adding a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m02s)

[generated file to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m05s)

[it with the key in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m08s)

[value from their dictionary](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m11s)

[interesting okay sorry say that say that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m18s)

[one toally fine say that one more time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m21s)

[for me of what you were](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m23s)

[proposing we don't want to do a decoder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m27s)

[or at least we don't want to do a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m29s)

[decoder the way we're doing it okay um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m30s)

[the output of the decoder and the text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m33s)

[extraction is actually what we want uh I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m35s)

[will claim blame for that one my bad um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m37s)

[but what that does mean is that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m41s)

[we can do all of the chunking and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m47s)

[actually utilizing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m50s)

[the uh existing URL and Tim stamp so if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m53s)

[you go down to the bottom of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m56s)

[file this is where we're actually going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h25m59s)

[to want to Output uh little bit up where](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m01s)

[you see that uh that new of the yep the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m04s)

[generated file details that's what we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m08s)

[going to want to end up creating and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m10s)

[we're going to add inside of that that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m12s)

[tags or elsewhere on here we'll actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m14s)

[probably have to create a new set of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m17s)

[tags and assign this new generated file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m19s)

[those new tags but in those tags we can](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m23s)

[include the URL that's associated with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m26s)

[that chunk and other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m28s)

[metadata got it sorry I just want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m32s)

[look at this real](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m35s)

[quick this guy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m37s)

[here it's very arbitrary](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m41s)

[is just dictionary he's just dictionary](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m47s)

[okay so you're propos it's just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m50s)

[dictionary of lists so you're proposing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m51s)

[make a new](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m54s)

[one that's similar to this but yet](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m56s)

[different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h26m58s)

[right uh yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m01s)

[yes see uh SRT mark](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m11s)

[um we'll](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m23s)

[go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m26s)

[that up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m28s)

[here it's already got that token counter](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m35s)

[in there for you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m38s)

[too then we want this to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h27m42s)

[okay we'll see what we end up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m08s)

[needing some of these are not available](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m11s)

[but you use](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m14s)

[those go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m16s)

[away so the text chunker bit is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m20s)

[potentially](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m23s)

[problematic please be a exposed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m25s)

[extension method you are not you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m28s)

[suck why why like why people why why Y](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m34s)

[what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m40s)

[benefit like here's a useful extension](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m41s)

[we're not going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m45s)

[share oh man I forgot about all these I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m47s)

[had to make so many](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m50s)

[extensions I just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m52s)

[okay okay internal constants I have a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h28m56s)

[theory that this is not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m00s)

[public go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m03s)

[away](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m07s)

[certainly um but it may or may not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m11s)

[matter we're just going to do this I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m13s)

[mean it's an yeah it's we're going to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m15s)

[this and we're gonna we'll we'll see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m20s)

[about addressing okay so aside from text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m23s)

[chunker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m26s)

[being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m27s)

[lagged on us we'll we'll deal with that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m29s)

[as they come so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m31s)

[okay somebody needs to fix their](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m40s)

[logging it bothers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m44s)

[me it also bothered the the intellitect](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m51s)

[uh analyzers analyzers yeah yeah I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h29m56s)

[believe it Okay so we've got that so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m02s)

[what in here are we proposing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m05s)

[changing uh so to start let's just kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m09s)

[of I go down yep take out the plane Tex](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m13s)

[perfect and then the rest of it I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m16s)

[to say honestly is probably](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m21s)

[fine and we could either build our own](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m24s)

[chunker or we can just put the stuff in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m27s)

[line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m30s)

[here I mean it's up to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m32s)

[you we don't have to use a chunker the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m36s)

[chunker's just a another](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m39s)

[piece um sorry I'm just I'm gonna shut](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m42s)

[this sucker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m46s)

[up tell it I really don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m50s)

[care](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h30m58s)

[okay okay so now we get down to here and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m00s)

[we're proposing this is where we want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m03s)

[do something slightly different right uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m05s)

[actually I'd go up first and where you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m09s)

[have your MIM type check yep mark down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m12s)

[this is where where we'll actually be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m15s)

[breaking it up into smaller](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m17s)

[pieces got it so I'm going to propose I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m20s)

[even go as far as to do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m23s)

[this this yes if you don't want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m25s)

[handle the case I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m28s)

[don't I don't care it doesn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m30s)

[exist works for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m34s)

[me I approve of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m37s)

[message there um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m42s)

[okay so we come in here we get the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m46s)

[content right yep and then once I have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m49s)

[the content this is where I want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m54s)

[actually do my what you were doing in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m56s)

[the other one yes so I want I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h31m58s)

[this little thingy to come over here and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m02s)

[I want you to go hang out down](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m05s)

[here and I want you to become a partial](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m08s)

[okay so he goes there and then we want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m28s)

[to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m31s)

[do somewhere in here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m45s)

[yes I want to do something akin to this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m47s)

[but it's going to be the same but](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m52s)

[different right like I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m54s)

[got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m57s)

[this it's about to do the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h32m59s)

[partitioning content right so I've got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m03s)

[I've got these two things that come](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m05s)

[out so it takes the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m08s)

[sentences so that would be like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m14s)

[individual lines in your markdown and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m16s)

[then it builds paragraphs or partitions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m18s)

[out of those so yeah because we won't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m21s)

[end up actually using this to split](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m23s)

[markdown lines into sentences like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m26s)

[because honestly I could even go as far](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m28s)

[as to say](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m31s)

[sentences](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m35s)

[uh sentences add line right I could do](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m36s)

[that yes and be very okay with this now](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m41s)

[one thing to keep in mind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m48s)

[um so you're going to add all the lines](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m51s)

[to the list of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m54s)

[sentences but are you going to track the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m56s)

[URLs that go with those lines yeah like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h33m58s)

[that and that was my thing as I was](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m02s)

[trying to see what this partitioning](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m04s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m05s)

[was it's just building it into a bigger](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m06s)

[chunk so it handles the oh but I've](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m10s)

[already built how long you're I already](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m13s)

[had the thing that built it into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m15s)

[chunks and you can just use that yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m19s)

[so WR file what is orchestrator WR file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m25s)

[doing file name binary content so I kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m32s)

[of feel like because this is just doing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m36s)

[the splitting and all of that but I kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m39s)

[of already](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m41s)

[have that information](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m43s)

[you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m47s)

[do right so if I if I pull this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m48s)

[out but I guess that's the hard part](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m54s)

[then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m57s)

[is if I leave the chunk as it sits right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h34m59s)

[I actually have a string of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m04s)

[URLs and that means I either chunk into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m08s)

[smaller groups and only use like the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m12s)

[first URL because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m15s)

[the URLs are just a a pointer into a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m17s)

[video mhm so I could get away with just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m19s)

[grabbing the first one throwing away the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m22s)

[others because they don't matter right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m24s)

[yep yep and then complely Mak making](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m27s)

[that my set of tags that go into here I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m30s)

[don't need this partitioning or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m34s)

[sentences or any of that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m36s)

[stuff right I want to take what I did](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m38s)

[build one of and then build one of those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m42s)

[build one of these well build several](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m45s)

[but yeah well but my thing is already](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m48s)

[coming](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m52s)

[in somewhat separated for me right like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m53s)

[I'm going to get a big chunk of stuff](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m57s)

[here so what I would like to do is I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h35m59s)

[want are you calling into your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m03s)

[decoder are you okay no you're pulling](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m06s)

[this out okay good we're good we're good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m08s)

[we're good I'm pulling across so I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m10s)

[going to do something like this instead](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m12s)

[right get of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m15s)

[this right and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m17s)

[content right and then uh we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m21s)

[do string URL get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m25s)

[uh gets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m29s)

[null and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m31s)

[do this so that I get the first](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m35s)

[one and then when I do this we do URL](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m38s)

[gets null grab the next one right so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m42s)

[this is this is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m46s)

[functionally like when I've hit here or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m47s)

[here is when I want to like make make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m50s)

[chunk yes so I I need I need the make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m52s)

[chunky](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m56s)

[code you all go away you you don't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h36m57s)

[matter to me you don't matter to me](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m00s)

[anymore okay so this is the make chunk](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m02s)

[bits right so this is what I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m06s)

[want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m10s)

[here and so what I would like to do is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m11s)

[is I would like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m15s)

[to go here void make](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m19s)

[chunk it's [ __ ] I do not want to make a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m24s)

[[ __ ] in my armor and I put you here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m27s)

[right so the text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m30s)

[becomes uh all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m34s)

[text to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m36s)

[string right so that goes like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m41s)

[that um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m44s)

[section number I don't know where that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m48s)

[getting used here partition](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m50s)

[number um this needs to be an](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m54s)

[incrementing INT this apparently needs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m57s)

[to be async](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h37m59s)

[task reason so section number doesn't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m03s)

[get used](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m05s)

[yet it means nothing we can replace it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m07s)

[obviously yeah like you see that too up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m10s)

[there and then this is upload file get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m13s)

[partition file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m16s)

[name just confuses to what this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m18s)

[is uh okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m24s)

[so was the previous](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m28s)

[code this is the got that from well all](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m36s)

[I need is the partition number and so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m40s)

[this is just getting the the partition](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m42s)

[numbers right and this just needs to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m46s)

[a counter so secretly what this becomes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m48s)

[is uh new files.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m53s)

[count](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h38m58s)

[because right so that goes like that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m09s)

[because then as we add things in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m12s)

[partition number automatic cment blah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m14s)

[blah blah blah blah right this now works](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m16s)

[this now works I now need to oh okay I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m20s)

[see what you're doing now yes yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m24s)

[um I don't need this garbage go away](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m32s)

[okay so that goes away that goes away uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m36s)

[this becomes okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m40s)

[count um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m43s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m46s)

[here so I want to make chunk a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m48s)

[sync 8 right and then the last thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m52s)

[that I would like it to do I would like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m55s)

[it to do this at the end of this method](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h39m58s)

[yeah so we can clear that out and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m01s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m04s)

[here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m06s)

[wait make chunky snc](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m09s)

[yeah so not the cleanest code I've ever](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m12s)

[written](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m15s)

[but right this guy goes through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m17s)

[here that all just works then partitions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m21s)

[is meaningless sentences is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m25s)

[meaningless partition content we are](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m27s)

[still using to get our content back out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m30s)

[MIM type](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m35s)

[be I see no point in keeping this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m37s)

[declaration because we throw the value](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m41s)

[away immediately this one here gets used](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m43s)

[here but I see no reason not to just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m48s)

[straight in line that because that just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m50s)

[makes it harder to read what is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m53s)

[happening by having it in two different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m55s)

[places clean that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h40m58s)

[out like I can flatten a bunch of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m00s)

[stuff okay so now I have this and now I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m03s)

[just need to build up tags which is a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m05s)

[tag](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m08s)

[collection so tag collection tags gets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m09s)

[uh pipeline.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m17s)

[tags.](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m19s)

[clone you and then](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m25s)

[tags uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m29s)

[URL gets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m32s)

[URL this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m35s)

[becomes tags what is your](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m37s)

[problem you just specific URL no it's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m39s)

[unhappy because it might be null](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m43s)

[H uh let's see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m46s)

[here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m49s)

[oh yeah I forgot I thought yeah I I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m52s)

[definitely said that that it's a list](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h41m57s)

[dictionary of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m00s)

[lists okay so this goes here this goes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m03s)

[here this goes here right and then what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m06s)

[I do is I come up here and I go ding](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m08s)

[ding ding and I take this guy and I go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m10s)

[back to to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m14s)

[my here right and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m16s)

[go you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m20s)

[Dum and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m23s)

[put this guy in his](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m26s)

[place](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m29s)

[yep then it just works so it does but we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m31s)

[can take off a few of uh a few extra](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m36s)

[things here that we don't need](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m39s)

[okay I don't think we need to summarize](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m42s)

[not yet maybe we'll do that in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m45s)

[future maybe we'll add some additional](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m46s)

[context there we definitely need to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m48s)

[generate embeddings yeah we definitely](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m50s)

[need to save records yep the rest of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m52s)

[that you can get rid of for the time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h42m57s)

[being we don't need any of this cleanup](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m01s)

[stuff we do not not for the time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m04s)

[being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m08s)

[okay uh that that looks like it should](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m10s)

[do what we want it do okay let's run](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m14s)

[this and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m16s)

[just I want to see I want to see I want](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m18s)

[to see it work and then I may have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m21s)

[call it absolutely because it is almost](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m23s)

[1:00 am it is I have to go do work after](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m26s)

[this are you familiar with what working](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m32s)

[hours](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m34s)

[are you mean 247 a day](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m36s)

[365 I mean that is an option](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m39s)

[36 three](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m43s)

[03:43:47,840 --> 03:43:54,120](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m46s)

something I how many holidays do we

[have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m51s)

[yeah okay so this has this is going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m54s)

[iterate through both generated files it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h43m57s)

[concerns me that I have extracted text](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m00s)

[and extracted Json as two files](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m01s)

[here but we'll see I have a feeling](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m06s)

[we're going to hit already processed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m08s)

[by um so the first generated file is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m10s)

[which Tex](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m13s)

[next uh this thing here has all of that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m18s)

[and it gives me back](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m23s)

[this wait a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m29s)

[minute](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m31s)

[how how did it strip out all of the oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m35s)

[hang](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m39s)

[on I left my content decoder](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m41s)

[ah yes I was like how did it how did it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m45s)

[strip out all of that content it it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m48s)

[should know how did it know to do that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m50s)

[like that was the whole point of us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m53s)

[doing that is so that we didn't have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m55s)

[something stripping our content on us](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m56s)

[yeah let's try this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h44m59s)

[again okay so once again I assume I'm](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m05s)

[going to see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m08s)

[the file details to generator files yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m09s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m13s)

[yeah so let's go down to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m13s)

[content content now looks kind of what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m20s)

[we would expect yes okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m23s)

[great we're going to do our chunky](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m27s)

[chunky thing and I kind of want to put a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m29s)

[break point here and I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m32s)

[put a breakpoint](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m34s)

[here okay so we hit the first one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m36s)

[reached some number of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m40s)

[things oh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m43s)

[before we were stripping that first line](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m45s)

[and now we aren't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m47s)

[anymore that's okay just let it run for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m49s)

[now and we'll see yeah so we'll let this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m52s)

[go](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m57s)

[um I realize we've got a token counter](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h45m59s)

[here and I'm doing my own token counting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m02s)

[up there so there's probably something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m03s)

[that there the tags collection contains](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m05s)

[what we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m08s)

[expect Mark file processed by](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m11s)

[we're going to let it go turn this break](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m19s)

[point off run it to the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m22s)

[end uh I'm just curious how far through](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m37s)

[this file we are but okay yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m39s)

[okay something that makes me concern](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m50s)

[that we're about to buffer overflow or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m53s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h46m55s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m19s)

[I'm feel like I've messed something up](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m24s)

[in this Loop but I don't understand how](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m26s)

[because it's a 4 each on matches of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m29s)

[content go into your make chunk a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m34s)

[sync I guess it's only at 108 that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m41s)

[actually not that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m44s)

[big yeah that doesn't seem too terribly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m46s)

[big but I'm also noticing like we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m48s)

[tokenizing in counting tokens multiple](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m51s)

[times that could be adding to our time](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m53s)

[we count tokens here and then we token](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m56s)

[count down here as](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h47m59s)

[well yeah and we're only token counting](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m00s)

[for a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m03s)

[log](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m05s)

[oh token count and token count two it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m12s)

[was reallocating a different variable](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m15s)

[this thing was never being](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m17s)

[reset](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m18s)

[ah so it was hitting on every single one](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m21s)

[of those try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m25s)

[again and I guess the important thing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m35s)

[here is a bunch of the stuff is actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m37s)

[being done locally](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m39s)

[here 30 so this thing is actually kind](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m49s)

[of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m52s)

[slow as a single process that's also](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m55s)

[goinging out and uh reaching out for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h48m58s)

[stuff yes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m01s)

[yeah relatively slow okay so there's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m03s)

[that and just looking at the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m07s)

[03:49:17,680 --> 03:49:24,560](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m14s)

files if we look at what is inside of

[each of these seems like to too](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m20s)

[many oh this is on a big file it's on a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m24s)

[big file we had like okay actually no](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m27s)

[that makes sense yeah so that's not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m29s)

[horrible okay so that appeared to have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m37s)

[done something I am realizing](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m40s)

[though we probably should have like dump](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m42s)

[the database or](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m45s)

[something](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m48s)

[so I'm not mistaken you don't have to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m51s)

[worry about that be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m54s)

[well I mean the easy thing will be if I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h49m58s)

[scroll to the right here in a minute and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m00s)

[we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m01s)

[see that URL in the tag it's the same if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m02s)

[it's the same file](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m06s)

[then expand out tags](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m11s)

[I don't see so know you were all there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m20s)

[yet yeah but it also hasn't hit my other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m23s)

[break point so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m25s)

[it's potentially not there](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m27s)

[yet is it still it still has to J the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m33s)

[embeddings then save them](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m37s)

[yeah but once we hit the next break](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m40s)

[point at the bottom of the four each](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m43s)

[that's when we should see it would you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m46s)

[think it should update these](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m48s)

[properly it won't if they have uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m51s)

[different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m55s)

[names it won't if they have different](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m57s)

[names different document IDs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h50m59s)

[yeah but it will know it will know that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m04s)

[the hashes are different so it'll know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m07s)

[that the content for this thing has been](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m08s)

[updated right](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m12s)

[I guess I'm just wondering am I going to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m15s)

[get new additions to this table or I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m17s)

[believe that you'll get new additions](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m20s)

[we've removed](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m23s)

[um we removed those](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m25s)

[deletions I think those deletions will](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m28s)

[handle cleaning up see this thing is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m30s)

[ordering by ID which I think it's going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m32s)

[to be fairly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m35s)

[random won't it be because the IDE is](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m39s)

[just made up the file name and the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m42s)

[good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m45s)

[yeah oh payload actually is what had the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m48s)

[URL in it not](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m51s)

[tags yeah the problem is you can't](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m53s)

[access the payload until later okay so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m55s)

[that guy just](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m57s)

[finished so if I just blind run this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h51m59s)

[sucker](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m02s)

[that I think this thing is going to be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m14s)

[fairly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m16s)

[random URL there's a URL it did make it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m17s)

[in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m22s)

[perfect okay so that appears to have](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m26s)

[worked](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m31s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m33s)

[sweet that is pretty](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m36s)

[good that is really](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m39s)

[good okay I'm checking this in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m42s)

[I'm going to leave the decoder here](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m45s)

[despite the fact that we don't think we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m46s)

[need this I'm going to get rid of the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m48s)

[to-do for sure](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m50s)

[um me check this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m52s)

[in uh let's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m55s)

[see put this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h52m58s)

[over uh working progress adding in AI](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m00s)

[support](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m08s)

[aring SRT](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m09s)

[cool H and](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m15s)

[push](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m17s)

[sweet that is cool that is very cool](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m20s)

[Casey I'm it's all right it'll get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m24s)

[better yeah I'm I'm looking forward to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m27s)

[this though because I I feel like](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m30s)

[there's a lot here to make this even](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m31s)

[better I just noticed my app settings](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m34s)

[isn't being checked in for some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m36s)

[reason cuz we're they're afraid you're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m39s)

[going to put a password in there you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m41s)

[know I'm just trying to help you out](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m43s)

[uh yeah just checking what's in](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m45s)

[it](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m48s)

[uh I'm sure I have a bad get ignore](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m53s)

[because of how the history of this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h53m56s)

[repository but that'll be able to grab](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m00s)

[it so cool um where do you picture going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m02s)

[next with](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m06s)

[this uh I think we'd want to take a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m10s)

[probably take a gander what we actually](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m13s)

[get out of this see if it looks good see](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m15s)

[if there's anything else that we could](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m17s)

[pull that would be useful um and then we](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m18s)

[could do uh just a full run see how that](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m22s)

[goes um we could start either](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m26s)

[a uh allowing this to actually cue jobs](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m30s)

[and then work those um in separate](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m35s)

[processes or on separate um workers](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m38s)

[or we can move from this once we get uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m42s)

[all this put in and get some chat going](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m45s)

[get some some responses make sure we get](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m48s)

[Mountain do out for best soda in the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m51s)

[world and uh yeah then we could do some](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m54s)

[benchmarking if we wanted and even](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h54m58s)

[develop our own Benchmark for this and I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m00s)

[know it'd be kind of funny I wonder if](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m03s)

[you could ask uh you know maybe put](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m05s)

[something out on Twitch or on Twitter uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m08s)

[and or ask your audience in some other](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m12s)

[way](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m14s)

[to generate questions that should be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m14s)

[able to be answered um I mean general](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m17s)

[questions to start and then maybe you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m21s)

[add in some of you know things that you](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m23s)

[know you said in streams or uh things](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m25s)

[that should be able to be answered via](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m28s)

[the content of your streams okay uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m31s)

[build a benchmark for it see how it does](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m34s)

[uh if it does terrible there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m36s)

[ways we can improve the](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m38s)

[actual chunking embedding you know uh](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m40s)

[even once we get to um actually adding](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m44s)

[in chat how we prompt you know so um](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m47s)

[there's there's quite a few places for](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m51s)

[us to go uh with regards to improving](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m52s)

[performance if necessary cool I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m55s)

[definitely like the idea of trying to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h55m58s)

[plug in chat and then see how it goes](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m00s)

[even if it falls over miserably yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m02s)

[absolutely start there it gets it gets](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m04s)

[people uh you know some insight on what](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m06s)

[we hope to do uh maybe seeing some good](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m09s)

[results or some bad ones yeah and then I](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m12s)

[may take a a little bit of cleanup so](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m15s)

[that we aren't just like hardcoded](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m17s)

[garbage like this](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m18s)

[but that that that is easy once we got](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m21s)

[this plugged in so I love it yeah cool](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m24s)

[absolutely love it well Casey as always](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m27s)

[this has been a pleasure uh for anybody](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m31s)

[catching the recording of This feel free](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m33s)

[to drop in if this was interesting to](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m35s)

[you I know this is kind of a a deeper](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m38s)

[topic than often times what we dive into](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m40s)

[but this is definitely an area of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m43s)

[interest for me so kind of hope to try](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m44s)

[it out and see with with the end hope of](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m47s)

[having a an AI version of myself yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m50s)

[see and and I'm most excited honestly](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m53s)

[when I get to come back on after a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m55s)

[couple more streams and we're building a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m57s)

[UI for this which you'll be the expert](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h56m59s)

[at and I'll be like well I don't know](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m02s)

[what the heck you're doing um so yeah](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m04s)

[it'll take like three minutes it'll be](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m07s)

[fine ah I don't know about that we're](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m08s)

[gonna make it beautiful we got to get a](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m10s)

[talking head on there remember that's](https://youtu.be/_m3yevSEsJ4?t=03h57m12s)
