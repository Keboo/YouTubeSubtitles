[hello everyone this is just sort of an](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h00m55s)



[ad-hoc stream I was gonna go through and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h00m58s)



[spend some time tonight reviewing poll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m00s)



[requests I've got exactly one Mountain](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m02s)



[Dews worth of energy in my system so I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m04s)



[gonna go until I'm either done or I run](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m07s)



[out of Mountain Dew or time so we'll see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m10s)



[how far we get this is mostly due to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m12s)



[falling behind on the material design in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m14s)



[zamel pull requests so for anyone](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m17s)



[interested it's going to be pull](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m20s)



[requests on these guys I'm hoping to get](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m23s)



[a release done and out soonish so we are](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m26s)



[going to give that a shot and see where](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m29s)



[we end up so we are okay first ones an](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m30s)



[easy one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m36s)



[these update icons these ones here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m36s)



[you'll note Auto detected by as your](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m41s)



[pipeline I have a release pipeline that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m44s)



[runs on a nightly process it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m47s)



[automatically goes to and generates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m49s)



[these pull requests anytime it do text a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m52s)



[change in the material design icons in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m54s)



[general I'm really just looking to see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h01m59s)



[if there's deletions and the easiest way](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m00s)



[to see that is looking at the enum at](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m03s)



[the end so they added some air](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m04s)



[humidifier ones chili off great with](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m07s)



[some aliases okay great](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m11s)



[cosine wave I'm noticing analog and sine](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m13s)



[waves seem to have dropped but those](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m17s)



[could have just gotten moved](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m19s)



[let's see download stuff through there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m20s)



[it's also worth noting I have scripted](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m25s)



[the the generation of the pack icon](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m28s)



[release notes I don't see anything in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m34s)



[here concerning this is an easy one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m36s)



[in general I haven't had to worry about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m39s)



[these pull requests in a while in the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m41s)



[wiki I have started generating out](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m43s)



[release notes of the pack icon changes](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m45s)



[so in general this library follows](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m48s)



[similar however it's technically a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m50s)



[breaking change to delete an icon and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m53s)



[the material design icons often either](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m55s)



[rename which is effectively a delete](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h02m59s)



[so in general I normally don't do](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m02s)



[breaking changes however](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m05s)



[I have just decided that doing breaking](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m07s)



[changes when they relate to the pack](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m10s)



[icon names will possibly come in one of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m12s)



[these updates and I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m15s)



[document what those changes are so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m16s)



[that's my compromised squash merged](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m18s)



[squash merge oh and we got to set a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m21s)



[milestone on this guy so this is going](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m23s)



[out in this release](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m26s)



[sure delete the branch doesn't really](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m27s)



[matter the pipeline will recreate if it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m28s)



[doesn't work okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m31s)



[first problems one pull request down](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m32s)



[need a map do much better okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m34s)



[let's carry on to something a little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m40s)



[more challenging let's see fixed message](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m42s)



[discard prevents messages showing all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m45s)



[okay so when snackbar queue discards](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m47s)



[duplicates it does this also after the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m52s)



[message has already been done that does](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m54s)



[sound bad so this is directly from the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h03m57s)



[demo app you'll note after message one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m02s)



[has been queued wreaking the button is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m05s)



[you can see the clicks multiple times](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m08s)



[effectively stop that message from](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m10s)



[coming through so discarding duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m13s)



[should only happen when there's multiple](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m18s)



[things in queue effectively this is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m21s)



[debounce](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m23s)



[is the intent behind this flag and it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m23s)



[looks like there was a bug with the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m26s)



[debounce and that it was always](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m28s)



[debouncing okay so a rename of the move](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m29s)



[method insert as last not promoted node](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m33s)



[yeah this was a bad name given that we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m39s)



[had things like add before in here this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m42s)



[was a horrible yeah and I don't mind the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m45s)



[reduction of the name the type in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m49s)



[general including the type as part of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m50s)



[the variable name is not necessarily a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m52s)



[good idea so let's see so checks the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h04m56s)



[ignore duplicates flag ah so I believe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m00s)



[this is on the end queue so when you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m03s)



[have a snack bar message queue there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m05s)



[two parts to this there's the when the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m08s)



[item is added to the queue and then](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m10s)



[there's also when the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m12s)



[item is shown and I'm guessing we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m14s)



[gonna see a deletion that looks kind of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m16s)



[similar to this item is promoted not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m19s)



[okay this seems fine](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m28s)



[is duplicate okay so there's a couple](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m35s)



[things I'm noticing here and they're not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m37s)



[necessarily bad so this allows a snack](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m40s)



[bar message queue item to check another](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m47s)



[item against it so I think given that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m51s)



[this is public I think there's a only a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m55s)



[few okay let's start with this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m57s)



[let's check the code out I already](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h05m59s)



[forgot my power request number 1806 and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m03s)



[give me get cracking 1806 you'll notice](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m06s)



[some of these older ones I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m11s)



[intentionally holding they're either](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m12s)



[things that are breaking changes that I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m14s)



[don't want to necessarily put in a minor](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m17s)



[release and so I'm holding them for a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m19s)



[larger version change or there there's a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m21s)



[couple of these down here that I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m25s)



[keeping around because I think the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m26s)



[functionality is good but the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m28s)



[implementations off and I don't know](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m30s)



[what the correct solution is so open to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m33s)



[feedback on those some of them probably](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m35s)



[should get closed I don't know I don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m37s)



[know I don't know I have this lofty goal](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m40s)



[of getting to a zero pull request count](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m43s)



[that way it's just new stuff okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m45s)



[let's go take a look at let's see a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m54s)



[snack bar message queue item all right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h06m58s)



[so this is the new guy boom come back to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m06s)



[you in a minute so this is public and so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m09s)



[in general I would argue that we need an](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m11s)



[old check here right because this guy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m13s)



[clearly assumes non-null but it's public](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m17s)



[which means it could be invoked outside](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m20s)



[of us and I'm not opposed to well it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m22s)



[an internal class probably should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m26s)



[probably should still have it and I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m30s)



[kind of tempted to go and write some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m33s)



[unit tests on this guy two real quick](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m34s)



[leave them open we'll come back to that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m38s)



[but we I feel like I want some tests](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m40s)



[around this duplicate logic just to make](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m42s)



[sure that we've had a lot of breakages](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m46s)



[around this in the past so making sure](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m49s)



[we don't continue that so let's see here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m51s)



[so this inserts an item and I remember](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m56s)



[the snackbar message queue itself being](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h07m59s)



[particularly difficult to unit test I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m01s)



[think it was this class because one of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m05s)



[these has a timer built into it and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m08s)



[timers are just a pain in the neck](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m10s)



[yeah I'm noticing there's a duration](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m12s)



[things like this are a pain in the neck](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m14s)



[to unit tests I've got some information](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m16s)



[in a talk I'm putting together around](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m21s)



[trying to unit test this but the short](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m24s)



[version pain in the neck yeah and so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m25s)



[this is also a pain in the neck because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m30s)



[this is effectively spinning a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m33s)



[background thread you know what](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m34s)



[just pump a sink complete while not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m39s)



[disposed this thing's long lived okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m43s)



[we should fix this - while we're in here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m47s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m51s)



[don't all you jump at once task creation](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m54s)



[options long-running I realized this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h08m57s)



[wasn't part of the original poll request](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m02s)



[so when doing stuff with the task](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m03s)



[parallel lipo task parallel flattened](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m06s)



[hang on we're gonna try that over when](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m09s)



[doing things with the task parallel](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m15s)



[library or TPL if you create a task](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m17s)



[that's designed to be running for a long](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m22s)



[period of time in general you want to do](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m24s)



[task creation options long running](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m27s)



[because this is a very strong hint to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m31s)



[the TPL that this task should probably](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m34s)



[not take up a thread pool thread because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m37s)



[it's gonna take a long time so your](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m42s)



[thread pool only has a finite number of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m44s)



[threads in it you don't want this thing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m45s)



[consuming one of those things I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m48s)



[most of the time it defaults it like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m51s)



[Denish 20-ish don't quote me on that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m52s)



[something like that has it some small](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m56s)



[number of threads which is great for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m57s)



[efficiency because threads are expensive](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h09m59s)



[but this guy is effectively he's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m02s)



[effectively got a loop for infinity](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m05s)



[right as long as this until this guy is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m07s)



[disposed so he is likely going to live](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m10s)



[for some long period of time like we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m12s)



[talking minutes right like however long](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m14s)



[the UI is that how old's onto this guy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m17s)



[so we're gonna just do that for a moment](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m20s)



[and let him sit there okay back to what](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m23s)



[we were actually looking at okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m27s)



[something about insert item around 264](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m30s)



[264 oh do I not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m34s)



[I don't have karnak running sorry about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m38s)



[that fire that back up soon boom there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m41s)



[we go cool little hot keys now show up](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m45s)



[yay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m47s)



[okay so insert item so this guy goes](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m48s)



[through an ad snackbar messages and I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m53s)



[trying to think I want to look and see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m56s)



[it would be really great if we could](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h10m58s)



[trigger this thing show a sync vaguely](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m01s)



[remember this being a pain to unit test](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m08s)



[yeah this this is also a pain to unit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m10s)



[test right because this is doing all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m14s)



[kinds of threading manual reset event](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m16s)



[garbage yeah that's gonna be a pain okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m20s)



[so the snack bar message queue item](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m22s)



[though there's no reason this guy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m24s)



[camping unit test can't be unit tested](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m25s)



[Wow](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m28s)



[maybe it's not a good night for me to be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m30s)



[coding let's just make sure it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m33s)



[probably not in here yeah we the the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m36s)



[unit test in this project were added](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m39s)



[very very late and so it's very common](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m40s)



[for most things to not have tests which](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m45s)



[is unfortunate but we're slowly remedy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m48s)



[in that situation it's also worth noting](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m51s)



[that a lot of this library cannot be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m53s)



[reached](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m56s)



[oh hello Houston a lot of this library](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h11m56s)



[cannot be reasonably tested simply](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m02s)



[because it is o internal so it will do](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m05s)



[great](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m10s)



[simply because it's UI dependent so unit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m13s)



[testing stuff with WPF that's UI](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m16s)



[dependent is a big no-no you'll spend](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m18s)



[way more effort writing the unit test to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m23s)



[try and make it work than it is worth](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m25s)



[and you should probably just write a UI](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m27s)



[test instead that's the general general](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m29s)



[best practice okay so what I was just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m32s)



[checking there is this class is marked](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m36s)



[as internal which in general means](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m38s)



[nothing outside of this library can](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m40s)



[touch it however we do explicitly have](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m43s)



[an internal visible to attribute set in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m45s)



[general this is a bit of an anti-pattern](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m49s)



[however a lot of times we mark things as](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m51s)



[internal inside of the library when I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m55s)



[not confident that the API is ready for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m56s)



[public consumption because once I make](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h12m59s)



[something public I'm sort of committing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m02s)



[to support it and so if I'm not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m05s)



[confident that something's ready to be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m06s)



[supported a lot of times we'll make it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m08s)



[internal](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m10s)



[just to give me time to to go over and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m12s)



[make sure that it is actually something](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m15s)



[I want to support but it doesn't mean I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m17s)



[don't want to write unit tests over it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m20s)



[so in general this is this is bad but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m21s)



[and I will clarify it is bad because it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m27s)



[usually indicates a flaw in your design](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m29s)



[because you shouldn't be testing things](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m34s)



[outside of your public API snackbar](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m36s)



[message queue item tests right okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m40s)



[we will do let's see this is I'm trying](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m46s)



[to remember this project uses X unit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m50s)



[excellent okay so let's clean this up](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m52s)



[clean up my usings](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m56s)



[let's see fact and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h13m59s)



[use the next unit public void okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m06s)



[what do we what are we actually going to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m11s)



[test here this is always the the key](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m13s)



[thing to understand so I think the first](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m15s)



[case to test is throws on no reference](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m16s)



[exception okay that's a simple one so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m19s)



[snackbar message queue item you know](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m24s)



[it's already on there so how about is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m31s)



[duplicate throws on small argument all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m33s)



[right so this is going to be a simple](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m42s)



[test assert throws argument no exception](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m44s)



[Oh what are you squawking about don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m55s)



[squawk add the thing uh so let's see far](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h14m57s)



[I need one I need one of these things](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m02s)



[I'm really sure I'm probably gonna need](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m07s)



[let's the item it's thinking I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m12s)



[thinking I'm gonna have to create these](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m16s)



[things a ton for these tests so thinking](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m17s)



[a little factory thinking a little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m21s)



[factory real quick just to just to make](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m28s)



[my life easy I'm not sure what I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m31s)



[need just yet](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m35s)



[why is intellisense appear broken](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m36s)



[content so how about a string for my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m39s)



[content currently come on intellisense](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m43s)



[why are you broken I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m47s)



[I recently uninstalled resharper and I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m50s)



[have a sinking suspicion that that is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m52s)



[contributing so most things are optional](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m54s)



[except for that so time span duration](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h15m57s)



[about time zero all right so we'll go](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m00s)



[something very generic created item](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m09s)



[I don't think bars very clear in that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m15s)



[case so item is duplicate no boum boum](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m17s)



[boum boum boum boum let's see if we turn](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m26s)



[on live unit testing we can then get](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m30s)



[instance to feedback going](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m31s)



[take the mountain doing away you go okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m40s)



[and then let's see here if we can get a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m45s)



[couple more so let's see so what exactly](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m52s)



[does this thing do let's just dock you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h16m58s)



[to the side for the moment so if it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m01s)



[not ignored duplicate let's see so how](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m08s)



[about void is duplicate duplicates is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m15s)



[true](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m29s)



[it returns false right so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m36s)



[if ignored so this should be a simple](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m45s)



[simple easy mode one right so Rumble](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m48s)



[boom](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m54s)



[let's see item ignore duplicate oh these](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h17m56s)



[are probably all read only aren't they](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m02s)



[yeah so I'm gonna have to set it I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m04s)



[gonna have to set it here bool ignore](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m08s)



[duplicate gets false](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m11s)



[okay this is this side-by-side things](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m19s)



[gonna be pain I'm gonna put it over here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m21s)



[I realize that everyone else can't see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m23s)



[it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m25s)



[trust me it's gonna be for my reference](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m25s)



[so let's see so ignore duplicate gets](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m28s)



[ignore duplicate we'll just leverage the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m34s)



[named parameters format that for me](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m38s)



[please thank you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m41s)



[let's see so do that guy and then cert](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m43s)



[false item this duplicate create item](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h18m53s)



[so let's see is duplicate I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m03s)



[I'm thinking we need content gets all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m06s)



[right I'm thinking we're gonna start](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m16s)



[needing to specify these things a little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m18s)



[bit so we're gonna go just come in here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m20s)



[do this do this right and then we will](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m24s)



[pass this through think of we should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m27s)



[just do the duplicate case next because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m30s)



[we really need the positive case to go](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m32s)



[with all of these negative ones we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m36s)



[going to right boom and so we're going](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m38s)



[to do other it is interesting that it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m41s)



[doesn't consider the others ignore](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m47s)



[duplicate it does mean it's a one-way](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m48s)



[street is that a problem I don't think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m52s)



[so because these are really just saying](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m55s)



[is this guy yeah I think it's so content](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h19m57s)



[gets good new grid to string all right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m05s)



[so pretty much guarantees that that'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m13s)



[be not duped and not possible to be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m16s)



[duped](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m20s)



[okay so that is duplicate wandering wait](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m23s)



[ignore duplicates is true so I actually](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m31s)



[actually wanted this right like I want](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m35s)



[these to be to be duped okay output](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m38s)



[window what is going on with live unit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m42s)



[testing build complete](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m44s)



[bill completed with the heirs what are](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m52s)



[the heirs](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h20m54s)



[what are you unhappy about show me show](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m00s)



[me your show me your stuff I know](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m03s)



[there's some new get warnings but turn](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m05s)



[those off for the moment see look I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m10s)



[click the button there's no more](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m12s)



[warnings they're gone let's see the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m14s)



[property is on doesn't exist in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m18s)



[namespace C](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m20s)



[appears we so these are demo I am not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m30s)



[really interested in chasing these at](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m35s)



[the moment so poof problem solved](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m37s)



[put build the only one that failed so it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m45s)



[looks like we might have to do a rep of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m50s)



[our ma app stuff that doesn't bother me](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m52s)



[too much they're still in there - oh](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m57s)



[preview phase and so they're constantly](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h21m59s)



[making changes look that succeeded okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m02s)



[live unit testing turn on build](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m05s)



[completed successfully building solution](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m09s)



[starting execution of tests excellent](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m11s)



[run the test make it be so find me my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m14s)



[unit tests to do so it's gonna run the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m19s)



[initial run of live unit testing can be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m26s)



[a little bit slow only because it is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m27s)



[going through and getting a baseline but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m33s)



[then as you start making changes it'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m35s)



[get smarter you'll note it looks like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m37s)



[it's duplicating but in fact if we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m39s)



[expand this out](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m41s)



[it's because our projects run both](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m43s)



[against net 4 5 and dotnet core 3 1 so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m46s)



[it looks like dupes the kind of our](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m50s)



[dupes but just in the event that there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m54s)



[is some difference between frameworks I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m56s)



[don't think we have any conditional code](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m58s)



[based on frameworks in fact I'm fairly](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h22m59s)



[confident in that I think the only](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m02s)



[subtle difference is a few like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m04s)



[dependency references of stuff that's in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m05s)



[the box versus stuff that's new game](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m07s)



[okay so let's let's do the positive case](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m10s)



[now because I think that's really is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m13s)



[duplicate how about change the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m16s)



[precondition with duplicate](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m21s)



[items it returns true so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m25s)



[turn this off to duplicate items change](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m32s)



[the assertion to be true and that should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m35s)



[pass now right so what we're looking to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m38s)



[see is those things change](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m42s)



[it's thinking about its life and running](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m48s)



[great okay that's what I wanted to see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m51s)



[so the the green arrows mean the tests](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m54s)



[were was run and has passed with the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m56s)



[latest changes right if you see that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h23m59s)



[little question mark it means that it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m01s)



[passed on the last time it ran but it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m04s)



[hasn't needed to run with the latest](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m07s)



[changes which for the most part live](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m08s)



[unit testing is pretty good about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m10s)



[knowing what it needs to rerun on not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m12s)



[perfect but it's pretty pretty good it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m14s)



[rarely misses okay so that handles that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m16s)



[case that handles that case let's look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m19s)



[and see what else we got right so we've](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m21s)



[got the other two equals R around the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m24s)



[content and action content properties so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m27s)



[about this string content string action](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m30s)



[content right we'll do that I think I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m34s)



[can come over here and just go something](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m40s)



[like action content action content if my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m42s)



[intellisense worked](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m48s)



[I might just reset it to make to make it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m49s)



[happy so let's go down here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h24m53s)



[let's see so let's see with different](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m02s)



[content until it turns false so we turn](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m12s)



[off our duplicates we turn the content](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m15s)



[of this guy into good new grid - string](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m19s)



[right and then is duplicate should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m27s)



[return false I kind of want to do the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m31s)



[same thing with action content right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m34s)



[with different action content action](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m39s)



[content all right well something like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m46s)



[that so I want to see those paths real](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m49s)



[quick yeah look at that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m52s)



[boom green checkmarks all the way across](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m54s)



[the board that's what we like to see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m56s)



[okay so we're now fairly confident that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h25m59s)



[this is working I wasn't overly](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m02s)



[concerned the implementation is fairly](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m03s)



[straightforward but it does mean that if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m05s)



[anybody tries to modify this to break](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m07s)



[those preconditions that will get some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m10s)



[unit test failures okay so back to this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m12s)



[because this is where this guy is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m19s)



[ultimately getting used you also note](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m21s)



[that ignored duplicate is used as part](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m23s)



[of this so insert item grabs the first](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m26s)



[item so if there is an item in the queue](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m30s)



[if we are not ignoring duplicates and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m35s)



[this item is a duplicate so if we are](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m40s)



[ignoring duplicates will fall down here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m43s)



[is that correct](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h26m47s)



[and for not ignoring duplicates why do I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m00s)



[feel like this is backwards](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m04s)



[maybe I'm just backwards and need more](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m05s)



[mountain dew let's read through this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m07s)



[because we've also got the promoted](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m12s)



[logic down below because before because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m14s)



[this promoted logic has changed to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m19s)



[actually check item is promoted right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m21s)



[because if you promote an item it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m26s)



[basically says push this guy to the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m28s)



[front of the queue at least that's the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m30s)



[intent right so it it jumps it forward](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m31s)



[to say be in the beginning so this is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m35s)



[looking at the first item in a linked](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m36s)



[list](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m38s)



[that's what note is right first item in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m39s)



[the linked list so if we are not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m42s)



[ignoring duplicates so ignore duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m45s)



[is false](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m49s)



[and item is a duplicate then return but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m52s)



[this has the duplicate logic of what we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m58s)



[had before and the item is a duplicate](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h27m59s)



[we're not ignoring duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m06s)



[I this feels like this is backwards and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m11s)



[this should be if ignoring duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m14s)



[and the item is a duplicate then don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m16s)



[bother to insert it let's test this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m19s)



[because something is something about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m25s)



[this is seeming a little bit off to me](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m27s)



[yeah something about this is seeing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m43s)



[seeming off okay so I believe let's just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m44s)



[fire up the demo app real quick it look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m50s)



[like sample for in the demo app was what](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h28m52s)



[was used previously](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m00s)



[okay so you here task manager here just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m04s)



[want to check and see how it's doing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m09s)



[looks like OBS is doing much better now](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m12s)



[that I my hard drive issues figured out](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m15s)



[excellent hot reload available oh yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m19s)



[this is so nice so nice so nice that'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m22s)



[be another feature to play with um okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m26s)



[been playing with it on my other](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m28s)



[computer hot reload is wonderful](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m31s)



[okay so example for right so foo right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m33s)



[send message foo](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m41s)



[if I click click click right three](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m46s)



[clicks and it discarded the duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m49s)



[if I turn this off click click click](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h29m53s)



[okay so it works as designed](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m03s)



[I am clearly just not smart enough to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m08s)



[understand okay so if we are not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m11s)



[ignoring the duplicates and item is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m15s)



[duplicate](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m17s)



[why am I so dumb about this it's just a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m26s)



[my reading this wrong](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m29s)



[because this gets triggered on NQ](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m35s)



[alright it accused the item inserts the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m37s)



[item triggers the reset event to let it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m40s)



[go](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m44s)



[so if we're not ignoring duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m45s)



[because this is when should I not add](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m48s)



[the item right so if not ignoring](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m51s)



[duplicates and item is a duplicate so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h30m57s)



[not ignoring duplicates so if I am](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m03s)



[ignoring not ignore I think this is this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m07s)



[not ignores what's making my head spin](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m11s)



[so not ignore](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m15s)



[Oh means you means consider duplicates](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m23s)



[okay okay that that made my head hurt a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m26s)



[little bit made my head hurt a little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m30s)



[bit okay so I think this is good](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m33s)



[right so I think this is fine](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m36s)



[the last shown item goes away the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m41s)



[promote goes away in favor of this so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m46s)



[this will insert it rather than always](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m53s)



[promoting it to the front this is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m55s)



[slight change in behavior in that it'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h31m58s)



[promote it before the first thing that's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m00s)



[not promoted and I think that makes more](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m04s)



[sense right if you've got two messages](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m06s)



[that you promote you sort of are I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m08s)



[should say if you include two messages](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m10s)



[both with promote true you sort of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m12s)



[expect them to come out in the order](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m15s)



[that they were in queued and this would](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m16s)



[fix that which is which is better right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m19s)



[let's see snack bar messages first](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m27s)



[surprised this syntax works I didn't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m33s)



[think we had no ability turned on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m35s)



[clearly it compiles](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m39s)



[okay they must have no ability turned on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m43s)



[that must be one of the BCL types if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m48s)



[anybody is interested in c-sharp eight](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m51s)



[nillable reference types](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m53s)



[I would love to consider pull requests](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m55s)



[that start adding them to this library](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m57s)



[even if it's only piecemeal I am at some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h32m59s)



[point I'm gonna bite it off myself and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m02s)



[go through and do it there's just a lot](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m04s)



[of code to change so there is that that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m06s)



[seems fine because this was checking on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m10s)



[content action content ignore duplicate](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m12s)



[nor duplicate and last shown item this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m15s)



[is by far much cleaner](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m19s)



[good code comments I like it okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m24s)



[we're just gonna add the unit test to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m28s)



[this real quick](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m30s)



[double-check it what do we change task](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m31s)



[creation options long-running null check](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m34s)



[some unit tests so let's see on stage](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m37s)



[all changes let's do these one at a time](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m45s)



[right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m47s)



[we'll separate these out so make the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m47s)



[thread pump pain messages or not thread](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m51s)



[task popping messages long-running](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h33m56s)



[commit all right and I think I'll just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m01s)



[do these two together added an old check](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m05s)



[to item added unit tests for is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m09s)



[duplicate method alright so some tests a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m16s)



[little bit push the change pull the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m21s)



[latest master while I'm sitting here and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m25s)



[then we will go I'm gonna let the CI](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m27s)



[system run just to make sure that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m29s)



[there's no issues but we're gonna](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m31s)



[preemptively just tack and approve onto](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m34s)



[the end of this I really at some point](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m37s)



[need to look it I think there's fancy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m40s)



[github actions that let you auto squash](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m42s)



[and merge with like a comment which](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m46s)



[would be nice because really all I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m48s)



[waiting for is the the CI system to say](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m50s)



[yep we're good why where's the build](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h34m53s)



[checks](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m02s)



[show me the checks yeah see pipeline](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m03s)



[running](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m06s)



[I think the GUI is just being slow yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m06s)



[I want to see that thing finish okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m10s)



[let's grab the next pull request while](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m13s)



[we wait on that guy so an attachable](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m14s)



[property background to hint assist let's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m18s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m23s)



[said default is value for transparent](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m26s)



[yeah so this one is a little more](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m37s)



[interesting so we've got a hint assist](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m39s)



[so in this library usually any class](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m43s)



[tends and the name assist is something](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m45s)



[that contains attached properties let's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m48s)



[see so background property default value](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m52s)



[of null that's fine let's see so it sets](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h35m56s)



[the value on the background to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m03s)



[transparent I think that's correct](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m06s)



[I think that's correct my only my only](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m12s)



[wondering is if it should be unset not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m16s)



[sure hey thank you for the follow](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m20s)



[I appreciate that welcome to the stream](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m23s)



[feel free to if you've got any questions](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m25s)



[feel free to post them I have a horrible](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m28s)



[tendency to get on rabbit trails](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m31s)



[answering questions and don't mind it in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m33s)



[the least let's see here are we going so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m34s)



[I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m41s)



[I'm just going to check this real quick](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m44s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m46s)



[I think we've got so I'm just bouncing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m50s)



[between my options okay so that's fine I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h36m55s)



[we may come back to whether this should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m01s)



[be transparent or unset but I I I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m03s)



[in my original comment I think I had](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m05s)



[suggested that it be well that's the one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m07s)



[right there I think I had suggested that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m10s)



[it should be transparent to add new](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m12s)



[background attached properties similar](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m22s)



[to foreground apply new property the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m23s)



[smart hint control sure that there is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m26s)



[default background set](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m31s)



[so I didn't actually call out what the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m40s)



[default should be okay so that is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m42s)



[probably fine there is a subtle](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m45s)



[difference between transparent and unset](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m48s)



[in that transparent will let you be hit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m50s)



[test visible so if people click on that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m53s)



[transparency area it will register the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m56s)



[mouse events whereas if you go unset the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h37m58s)



[click just passes right through and you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m02s)



[never get the mouse events coming](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m04s)



[through so not getting the mouse events](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m07s)



[is more performant doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m09s)



[probably not let's keep going let's just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m13s)



[see where this goes so we've got a hint](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m17s)



[assist is floating so if we if the hint](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m21s)



[goes floating it's gonna set the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m28s)



[background](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m30s)



[I wonder why we need I'm questioning](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m35s)



[whether this should be inside of this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m39s)



[setter or not did I say that I did say](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m40s)



[where the where the foreground is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m47s)



[getting applied so we might go and look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m50s)



[at this let's go and just check this out](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m52s)



[real quick okay attachment property here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m54s)



[let's go there take a look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h38m59s)



[okay so there's the hint assist one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m10s)



[let's find let's see so I want to look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m13s)



[at textbox zamel so Xbox](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m19s)



[zamel that one please and uh close all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m25s)



[but this so let's look for text box](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m36s)



[already forgotten the name see I'm not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m43s)



[doing well at this hint assist and I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m45s)



[really interested in checking in to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m48s)



[assist foreground to make sure we've got](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m50s)



[background setters at roughly the same](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m51s)



[spots right so foreground is set there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h39m54s)



[we've got a background to go with it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m00s)



[great we do have a foreground setter](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m01s)



[here so is floating and gain focus so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m06s)



[this is so this is a combination right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m14s)



[so if you have a multi trigger with two](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m17s)



[conditions these conditions are ANDed](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m19s)



[together so this the foreground will](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m21s)



[only be set if is floating and keyboard](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m23s)



[focus is true the backgrounds being set](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m26s)



[in the case where just is floating is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m29s)



[true which is probably fair right as](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m32s)



[soon as the hint goes floating we don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m35s)



[care whether the background whether we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m37s)



[have keyboard focus or not we want the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m39s)



[background set pulls it from the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m41s)



[template that's fine oh and that's it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m43s)



[okay so that seems very very reasonable](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m51s)



[and then what is this 357 what style is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h40m55s)



[that on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m00s)



[material design outline text field text](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m06s)



[box so that would be it to do let's look](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m09s)



[at fields let's see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m14s)



[outline text field text box so I believe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m19s)



[it's this one right outline text field](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m22s)



[text box](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m26s)



[yeah outline text field text box Wow](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m27s)



[that is a mouthful so this guy here yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m31s)



[so having this guy's background default](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m36s)



[to paper is probably the closest to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m39s)



[reasonable I don't know what else she](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m41s)



[would want that to go to I mean if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m44s)



[people have their their own custom](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m45s)



[backgrounds here you may end up having](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m47s)



[to override this but as has clearly been](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m49s)



[demonstrated it can be easily overridden](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m52s)



[so it is defaulting to a reasonable one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m53s)



[there and I think the only reason we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h41m57s)



[can't use transparent here is because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m03s)



[without it being opaque you end up](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m06s)



[seeing the line through the back I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m09s)



[fairly confident in that one so that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m10s)



[looks very reasonable I think this is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m14s)



[wonderful one so we're gonna mark it as](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m19s)



[approved there's nothing in here that I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m22s)



[can reasonably test so we won't worry](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m24s)



[about unit tests let's see set the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m26s)



[milestone set some labels on it right so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m30s)



[this is an enhancement and I think I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m33s)



[gonna tag this with the release notes so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m36s)



[this release notes tag on here this just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m38s)



[is a hint to me when I go to do the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m41s)



[release that I should consider putting a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m44s)



[little note a bullet point in the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m48s)



[release notes about this feature being](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m50s)



[done so let's see this guy finished here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m51s)



[so we're gonna squash merge him first](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m56s)



[and then this other one is probably in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h42m57s)



[the same boat check for merge ability](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m02s)



[they shouldn't conflict because they](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m05s)



[touch disparate areas great squash merge](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m06s)



[squash merge we got two things in we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m09s)



[cruising](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m12s)



[okay so oh I wanted to check this guy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m14s)



[real quick because sometimes ya see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m17s)



[this I really wish there was a way to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m25s)



[make it auto set milestones for me I've](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m27s)



[got a little github CLI that I've](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m31s)



[written to automate bits and pieces I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m34s)



[might add that to it to just go through](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m35s)



[and if I put a pull request in a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m38s)



[milestone update the issue to go with it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m40s)



[right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m42s)



[in general I always want the pull](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m42s)



[request and it's linked issues to be in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m45s)



[the same spot not always right there are](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m47s)



[but I think at least if the issues not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m50s)



[in a milestone and it's pull request is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m52s)



[probably go in that one that's probably](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m55s)



[a very reasonable default okay let's see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h43m58s)



[so what do we got here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m03s)



[material design choice chip outline](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m06s)



[radio button ah so this is it sounds](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m08s)



[cool and then list box variants so real](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m15s)



[quick my first my first question when](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m18s)



[looking at this is yes so there is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m20s)



[changes in the demo app huzzah so I for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m23s)



[anybody wanting to submit I don't mind](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m28s)



[if you don't do it but before merging](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m30s)



[your poll request any sort of new](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m33s)



[feature II thing I usually try to make](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m35s)



[sure is shown off in the demo app](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m38s)



[somewhere that last one is a little hard](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m40s)



[one to show off but I do try and make](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m43s)



[sure that our that our demo app is a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m46s)



[reasonable example of what's possible in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m49s)



[the library not saying people should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m52s)



[mimic it exactly but it is expected to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m54s)



[show off usually the breadth of what's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m57s)



[possible okay go away go away little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h44m59s)



[pop-up just noticed](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m02s)



[let's see so let's go ahead and look at](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m05s)



[this guy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m08s)



[I got bad news it's only about half a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m08s)



[mountain dew of time left now there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m13s)



[less oh what is your problem](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m18s)



[Oh probably live unit testing is holding](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m24s)



[on to something well let's try that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m26s)



[again so go here yeah I don't know why I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m29s)



[don't know why you're all excited about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m35s)



[that change branches please because it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m37s)



[being used by another program fine I'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m41s)



[close visual studio I don't know who is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m43s)



[holding on to this it turns out to be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m46s)



[you get cracking I'm gonna be very](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m50s)



[disappointed okay you're off the hook](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m52s)



[get crackin it's probably Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h45m55s)



[a no problem Metal Slug do you have any](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m01s)



[pull requests sitting in there right now](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m04s)



[I don't think I remember seeing any I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m05s)



[try I usually go through and review them](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m08s)



[in chronological order of when they came](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m10s)



[in looks like I just have three more to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m12s)



[get through I do want to go through and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m16s)



[get the three one to release moving not](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m19s)



[at the moment but I test out the combo](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m24s)



[box fix and it looks good excellent](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m25s)



[you're talking about eighteen eleven](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m27s)

[you were perfect yeah cuz you were the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m34s)



[one who commented on the previous fix](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m36s)



[about its positioning being off so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m38s)



[excellent I'm planning on trying to get](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m41s)



[through most of these tonight we'll see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m44s)

[cool oh and I do appreciate by the way](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m50s)



[all of the the testing on fixes and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m54s)



[preview builds I oftentimes wonder how](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h46m56s)



[much testing I'm actually getting on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m00s)



[preview builds which always worries me a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m03s)



[little bit before kicking another one](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m06s)



[but my goal is to have a start kickin](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m07s)



[releases a lot quicker which hopefully](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m10s)



[means that if I accidentally release a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m15s)



[bug the fix is coming soon behind I've](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m16s)

[remember who did it there was a very](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m48s)



[nice person who who implemented the very](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m49s)



[feature that I want where you can just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m52s)



[toggle light dark mode so I don't have](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h47m53s)

[through it did I just paste the code in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m39s)



[small update ah that's what I did I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m43s)



[pushed my own Fork because I didn't have](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m49s)



[direct access ha ha so the one thing I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m51s)



[did here and I don't know if I like it a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m54s)



[lot but I did build up this little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h49m58s)



[itty-bitty converter here right so the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m02s)



[hard part is the the primary issue I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m05s)



[should say with these guys knowing and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m09s)



[changing they're right like there's a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m12s)



[desire to change the colors out when](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m15s)



[you're in dark theme which makes sense](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m17s)



[right so for starters the request to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m19s)



[change these colors when you're in dark](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m22s)



[theme is perfectly reasonable the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m23s)



[problem is what counts as dark theme](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m25s)



[right like there are there's two](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m27s)



[built-in themes light and dark but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m30s)



[there's nothing stopping you from](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m33s)



[rolling your own theme that happens to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m35s)



[use orange and green aside from maybe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m37s)



[throwing up when you see those colors so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m39s)



[because custom theming exists there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m43s)



[not a great way to know am I in a dark](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m46s)



[theme so I wrote this little converter](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m49s)



[here that can go through and check hey](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m54s)



[is a given thing a dark color all right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h50m57s)



[and just try and get things closer and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m02s)



[so it'll it'll kick back something about](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m06s)



[whether it's dark or light and it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m09s)



[basically leverages this built so we've](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m11s)



[got this method built into the library](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m14s)



[contrasting foreground color right so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m17s)



[boom boom right and so there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m20s)



[math in here and weird stuff the this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m26s)



[math is actually not overly complicated](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m28s)



[this is the same way that you convert](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m30s)



[RGB to grayscale you'll find that these](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m35s)



[are well known constants or things that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m38s)



[that are very similar to this some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m41s)



[people you know use point to point seven](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m43s)



[and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m46s)



[you know 0.01 or 0.02 or something like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m46s)



[that and get roughly the same right it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m49s)



[just how much should each of the colors](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m52s)



[contribute to effectively be a grayscale](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m53s)



[and then we've got this somewhat](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m56s)



[arbitrary threshold that says okay if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h51m59s)



[you're greater than this point we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m01s)



[going to assume that the that the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m04s)



[contrasting foreground color is black](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m06s)



[right so basically if you were greater](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m08s)



[than this point we assume you're a light](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m12s)



[color or white or similar right and if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m14s)



[you're less than this threshold we](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m17s)



[assume that you're a dark color and you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m19s)



[should be black and therefore the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m21s)



[contrasting foreground color is white so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m22s)



[this thing is built into the library I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m25s)



[don't know if anybody really noticed it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m27s)



[dropped with the 300 release with all of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m29s)



[the major theming updates that we did](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m31s)



[and so this is all built-in and nice and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m33s)



[pretty and works](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m36s)



[why just noticing that we have some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m37s)



[weird code here why do we have discards](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m42s)



[can't I just do that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h52m51s)



[I can't I just do](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m00s)



[so isn't that the same as that anyway](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m08s)



[I'm getting I'm getting off in the weeds](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m13s)



[where's the wig good question](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m17s)



[hold that thought](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m20s)



[they're the only thing that's weird is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m26s)



[for some reason my green screen and my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m28s)



[chroma key yellow and green are too](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m30s)



[close apparently so you get those weird](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m33s)



[black artifacts where it starts letting](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m35s)



[the the green in my yellow wig shows the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m38s)



[show through anyway I'm gonna put those](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m40s)



[back cuz I don't want to accidentally](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m43s)



[break something without putting in test](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m44s)



[for this but something about that seems](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m46s)



[weird okay so that's the functional](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m48s)



[problem with these these things is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m54s)



[wanting to do that change and knowing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m56s)



[what is the appropriate color to put](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h53m58s)



[here you're welcome I'm glad I'm glad](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m00s)



[somebody appreciates my sometimes dry](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m03s)



[humor yeah so they're there so I don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m08s)



[know the answer I think the short](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m15s)



[version is I'm gonna jump over this pull](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m16s)



[request for the moment and come back to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m19s)



[it because there's I don't know I don't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m20s)



[know if there's going to be a great](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m27s)



[answer and I don't want to necessarily](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m28s)



[block this and so I want to label this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m30s)



[up right like enhancement and I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m33s)



[I'm gonna leave it there right there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m37s)



[there there's a quick issue here yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m39s)



[open issue and I'm gonna just put myself](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m44s)



[on here as a reviewer because I want to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m47s)



[I want to make sure to give this a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m49s)



[thorough review and look it over I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m51s)



[I could probably get that does material](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m52s)



[design have any specifications on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m56s)



[dark-themed so the answer is yes ish and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h54m58s)



[I've gone over the the docs on this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m02s)



[multiple times the it doesn't appear to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m05s)



[be it doesn't appear to be clear on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m10s)



[exactly what the color should be right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m13s)



[so there's not a clear indication of in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m16s)



[dark-themed this is how the color should](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m19s)



[behave one possible solution I see -](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m21s)



[this is part of the issue here is this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m25s)



[allows it's leveraging some opacity](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m27s)



[which is why when this is selected it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m32s)



[shows through some](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m37s)



[versus when it's not right so there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m39s)



[some amount of opacity here that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m42s)



[probably could be stripped out of the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m44s)



[style I've been slowly moving away from](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m46s)



[hasty oh thank you for the subscribe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m50s)



[poker I've been moving away from using](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m53s)



[opacity for theming colors and only](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m55s)



[using it for things like disabled](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h55m59s)



[because ultimately if you've got opacity](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m01s)



[as part of your theme it gets to be very](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m05s)



[problematic when it comes time to mix](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m07s)



[and match with other themes which is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m13s)



[we're seeing it just in a small portion](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m15s)



[between dark and light theme I can only](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m17s)



[imagine how bad it gets with custom](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m19s)



[theming so I do like this layout of how](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m21s)



[this has been done down here this is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m25s)



[this is pretty cool in my mind because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m26s)



[it shows you all all of the cases of how](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m29s)



[this is for the the listbox so if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m32s)



[somebody wants to lay it out in here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m34s)



[which is pretty cool but yeah so I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m36s)



[definitely like this and I want to come](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m41s)



[back and revisit this but I think I want](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m43s)



[to revisit this when I've got less](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m46s)



[tiredness and more Mountain Dew in my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m49s)



[system so because I think I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m51s)



[there's a solution here and I think the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m56s)



[solution might be as simple as kill the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h56m57s)



[opacity I know when we initially tried](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m01s)



[to kill the opacity there was still a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m03s)



[problem in that things did not they were](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m05s)



[not easily visible right so if people](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m08s)



[have a good suggestion of how to adjust](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m10s)



[this I'm all ears and again I do have](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m12s)



[and I'll drop this link in the chat](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m16s)



[because this is probably helpful right](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m17s)



[so so issue 1757 my comment with this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m20s)



[small update right there's a very subtle](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m25s)



[thing with this this converter here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m29s)



[right so if anybody's if anybody's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m33s)



[interested that's where it's buried out](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m36s)



[on my fork of the material design and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m40s)



[again it's this I've shown people this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m42s)



[type of converter before because this is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m44s)



[not the first time people have asked for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m47s)



[how do I detect if I'm in light or dark](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m48s)



[theme mode](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m51s)



[and the answer is I could put in a check](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m52s)



[for if you're in the built-in light or](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m54s)



[dark themed mode but at a certain point](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m56s)



[custom theming exists and I may if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h57m59s)



[somebody changes one of those brushes I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m02s)



[don't actually know](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m04s)



[so what counts as dark theme so that's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m05s)



[that's always the hard part of where I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m08s)



[where it's like what is dark theme](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m10s)



[maybe somebody lightens up a few of the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m13s)



[brushes is it still a dark theme maybe I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m15s)



[don't know so I like this because it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m18s)



[at least an objective standard it's an](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m21s)



[arbitrary standard but at least its](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m23s)



[objective okay so we're gonna circle](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m25s)



[back to this let's see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m28s)



[fix for selected background on datagrid](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m30s)



[right so this was I think Metal Slug you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m33s)



[may have initially commented on this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m36s)



[right are you the one who opened the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m39s)



[issue maybe not this may have been](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m40s)



[something that came up and get her chat](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m44s)



[but uh see this went back and forth yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m46s)



[get her chat oh that's right that's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h58m57s)



[right because this was this was the bit](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m01s)



[here and updated them consider okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m04s)



[yeah Oliver has been absolutely amazing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m09s)



[when it comes time to change stuff he's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m14s)



[he's overly detailed which I approve of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m17s)



[it makes it very easy to review his](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m20s)



[stuff let's see we're starting the day](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m23s)



[to go trigger backgrounds updated](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m25s)



[datagrid okay so let's see here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m27s)



[let's take a quick peek so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m31s)



[yeah I have to admit he has been amazing](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m35s)



[and the the sheer quantity of pull](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m39s)



[requests he has submitted is he's making](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m42s)



[me look slow I'll put it that way uh and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m46s)



[I try not to be slow I try to be on top](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m50s)



[of things](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m52s)



[let's see border brush border thickness](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m53s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m56s)



[totally agree Oliver if you're watching](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=00h59m57s)

[contributions are not going unnoticed](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m03s)



[let's see that's just formatting that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m05s)



[out that's fine so multi data triggers](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m09s)



[this is going back this elected relative](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m12s)



[sources mouse over selection active Oh](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m17s)



[clever use of the attached property okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m22s)



[so I won I don't see any major problems](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m29s)



[with that but let's take a quick peek at](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m32s)



[yeah Oliver you started committing so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m36s)



[many things I'm just leaving your user](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m39s)



[as a remote on my um I get cracking](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m41s)



[because that's how often I need it there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m45s)



[this hair does not come well](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m50s)



[for what little that's worth okay](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h00m56s)



[because I'd like to get these last two](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m00s)



[pull requests knocked out because more](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m01s)



[importantly if I get them knocked out in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m04s)



[the next hour they get picked up for my](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m06s)



[nightly release which would be cool so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m08s)



[do](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m13s)



[oh right oh wait this is probably yes](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m14s)



[yes ha ha that's the button I like ok so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m17s)



[there's that I am interested because](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m22s)



[this was specifically around when](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m26s)



[selection mode sell right so it looks](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m28s)



[like the auto-generated ones is where](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m31s)



[it's yeah is that what that was the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m33s)



[issue there before right it's making](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m38s)



[sure that it's there yeah that looks](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m40s)



[nice this is one of those areas so in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m45s)



[general I would say that material design](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m47s)



[specifications should always take](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m50s)



[precedence](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m53s)



[however they are unfortunately very](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m54s)



[silent in how default WPF controls](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h01m58s)



[should behave and so the the next](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m01s)



[guiding principle is I usually go with](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m04s)



[it should then match how the default](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m06s)



[control without our styling behaves and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m08s)



[after that it's a complete judgment call](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m10s)



[so but for the most part that has served](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m14s)



[me well I like that that is that looks](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m18s)



[that looks good](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m23s)



[well that one doesn't have the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m26s)



[validation I don't know if do any of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m28s)



[these have it yeah that has the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m30s)



[validation on it boom boom clean easy](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m31s)



[approval easy approval let's see let's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m39s)



[see files changed easy approve yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m46s)



[I agree with you that highlighting rows](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h02m59s)



[may be confusing and I have to say like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m01s)



[so in general because the material](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m05s)



[design spec takes precedence I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m09s)



[that should be the default but there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m12s)



[been a lot of cases where I don't think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m14s)



[their specification takes into account](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m19s)



[desktop very well which is what we're](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m23s)



[building and so there have been there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m25s)



[a lot of times where I'll err on the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m28s)



[side of making the default match the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m30s)



[spec but then making sure we can](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m33s)



[override it that way people can go](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m35s)



[through and change it if they need to so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m38s)



[I think that's the closest to a fair](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m40s)



[balance that I can come up with and I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m42s)



[think this one because you said you](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m46s)



[already looked at it which gives me a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m49s)



[high degree of confidence to begin with](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m51s)



[datagrid combobox](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m53s)



[let's just check so canvas left so that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m55s)



[was probably part of the issue](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h03m59s)



[that guy got dropped I do like this Auto](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m04s)



[formatting I have considered and I'll](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m07s)



[show you this too real quick I keep](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m11s)



[turning it on and off because I can't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m14s)



[decide what I want but there is the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m15s)



[sam'l styler extension and I think what](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m19s)



[I may do is build a pipeline that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m22s)



[automatically formats the source code](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m26s)



[every night and generates a pull request](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m28s)



[if it finds any differences similar to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m30s)



[the icon stuff because I like the idea](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m32s)



[of forcing our zamel to be nice and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m37s)



[conform to a style but I don't want that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m39s)



[to be a limiting factor for somebody](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m41s)



[contributing to the repository so if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m43s)



[people don't format their code but it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m46s)



[functionally works I don't want to block](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m48s)



[those pull requests right I I try to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m50s)



[make this an easy library for people to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m52s)



[contribute to but at the same time I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m54s)



[also want the formatting to be pretty so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h04m58s)



[I I keep toying around with that idea](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m00s)



[and playing with it I mostly like the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m04s)



[tool and the default settings are pretty](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m06s)



[close to what I want and match most of](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m08s)



[what we do anyway so it's probably an](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m11s)



[easy one because most of these look like](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m14s)



[they're just straight-up newline](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m16s)



[formattings which doesn't don't bother](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m18s)



[me and frankly this is easier to read](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m20s)



[then than this let's see smart hint oh](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m23s)



[dear heavens](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m28s)



[yeah completely agree so let's let's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m33s)



[just pop this guy open real quick but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m37s)



[boom yeah I definitely have favored the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m41s)



[the new line as well it it just there](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m47s)



[are two I like I'm I'm probably the most](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m52s)



[guilty of just putting too much stuff on](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m54s)



[one line don't watch my previous streams](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h05m57s)



[because I do it a lot but in general I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m00s)



[do like the new line stuff and the the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m05s)



[zamel styler it's got a setting where](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m07s)



[where you basically can tell it how many](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m11s)



[attributes before a new line and so it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m12s)



[it it's it'll it forces you into it even](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m17s)



[where you know I usually will say well](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m20s)



[subjectively I can get to on this line](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m23s)



[because they're short and it doesn't](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m25s)



[make the line too long and whatever](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m26s)



[right but I wish I really want it to be](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m27s)



[if I get it down to one I can hit enter](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m34s)



[and navigate that would be a nice a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m36s)



[nicety okay do I even have a combo box](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m39s)



[on one of these I don't know if I do oh](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m43s)



[wait I got one here](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m49s)



[alright so there's that and I think if I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m52s)



[just make this guy bigger yeah that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h06m54s)



[recreates the bug right just moving this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m00s)



[guy around and changing the size up I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m03s)



[think I am noticing that that vertical](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m07s)



[line and I don't know if we've ever done](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m12s)



[this yeah yeah regardless this looks to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m14s)



[be working rather well once again](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m22s)



[another easy approve so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m26s)



[another very easy approve and easy to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m32s)



[get stuff committed through okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m36s)



[there's that oh I didn't check the last](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m38s)



[one to make sure I moved the milestone](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m42s)



[on it dang it](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m43s)



[we'll go back and check in just a second](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m44s)



[so squash merged squash merge oh let's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m46s)



[see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m51s)



[I don't know if I oh I'm gonna tag this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m51s)



[with potential release notes cuz that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m57s)



[it's not necessarily something that](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h07m59s)



[people have complained about but it it's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m01s)



[definitely a long-standing issue so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m03s)



[let's check this real quick did I that a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m05s)



[fix I don't remember if there was a oh](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m08s)



[it did I think it auto reclosed it oh so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m11s)



[this moved it here that's fine this is](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m18s)



[one of those areas where what milestone](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m21s)



[does that bug belong in if it was fixed](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m23s)



[in one broken and re fixed another yeah](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m25s)



[not a big deal okay so that guy's good](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m30s)



[that guy's good that guy's good okay so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m33s)



[if things go well I and Metal Slug if](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m37s)



[you're interested in testing the the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m41s)



[beta builds I would like to kick a](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m44s)



[release I've actually gone through and](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m47s)



[I've started](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m51s)



[Jenning up the so nobody but me can see](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m53s)



[this but I've start already started](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m56s)



[Jenning up the the release notes for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h08m58s)



[this and so there's probably I I believe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m00s)



[I've tagged a few more items to be put](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m03s)



[on here but you'll yeah you'll note all](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m05s)



[of her name shows up a lot but this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m08s)



[whole section down here gets](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m13s)



[auto-generated for me the pack icon](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m15s)



[change list gets generated for me and so](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m17s)



[I'm I'm planning on kicking this release](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m20s)



[soon ish once I feel like I've got](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m23s)



[enough confidence to do it I had thought](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m27s)



[about doing it before and then people](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m29s)



[were reporting bugs with the the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m32s)



[datagrid changes and so I I got a little](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m34s)



[gun-shy I'm pulling the trigger but](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m37s)



[hopefully hopefully that gets](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m38s)



[with all of these changes going in I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m43s)



[sort of hoping that maybe sometime this](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m45s)



[next week](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m48s)



[it goes through awesome yeah if you want](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m49s)



[to drop me a line to in the get er chat](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m53s)



[and let me know how the pre-release](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m56s)



[stuff goes especially after merging in](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h09m57s)



[these fixes those bugs that were](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m00s)



[mentioned were really the only things](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m02s)



[holding me back from kicking the release](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m04s)



[so if everything there looks good I'm](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m05s)



[pretty likely to just kick a release](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m08s)



[this week and again I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m11s)



[get it into faster cadence of just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m14s)



[dropping out new releases every time or](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m16s)



[dropping releases a lot quicker that way](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m19s)



[things don't sit and stagnate as well](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m22s)



[because I always hate having to tell](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m24s)



[people oh grab the pre-release nougat](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m25s)



[it's like well I should probably just](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m27s)



[kick the release there's no reason to](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m29s)



[let it sit and grow makes typing the](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m30s)



[release notes a lot harder when there's](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m33s)



[600 something items in them so like I](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m34s)



[said probably this week maybe](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m38s)



[unless stuff comes up and then I get](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m40s)



[gun-shy and pull it off so and I think](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m42s)



[yeah I think that ends the mountain dew](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m46s)



[so I think with that I'm probably going](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m50s)



[to end it for tonight thank you guys for](https://youtu.be/_dhQLZ6mS0I?t=01h10m53s)
