[you can use to interact with git I am](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h11m03s)



[heavily biased and think they get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h11m05s)



[cracking is the the best tool possible](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h11m07s)

[the market but people will disagree with](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h12m01s)

[representation of the the history tree](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h12m08s)



[and get crackin makes it far superior to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h12m10s)

[tonight I really want to focus on using](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m34s)



[git and that interaction and the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m37s)



[emphasis here should be that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m39s)



[have to be related to code this can be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m41s)



[just related to documentation](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m44s)



[information there's there's many repos](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m45s)



[that store their information inside of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m47s)



[markdown files or straight text files](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m50s)



[inside of a repo and those are perfectly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m52s)



[fine it doesn't have to be something](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m54s)



[that compiles okay and ultimately at the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m56s)



[end of the day code is just a text file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h15m59s)



[yeah or hosting a website in a repo](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m02s)



[that's a great example there's a github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m05s)



[pages which which goes out of their way](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m07s)



[to to try and make website hosting from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m09s)



[a repository really easy that way you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m12s)



[can keep track of all your stuff in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m14s)



[source control as well so don't know if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m17s)



[I'll actually dive into that that might](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m20s)



[be a fun thing to cover on the stream](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m22s)



[some day of setting up a github pages](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m23s)



[because I know some people actually use](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m25s)



[those for like a resume to be able to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m27s)



[host them so if if you're looking for a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m29s)



[quick and easy way to kind of stand up a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m32s)



[web resume github pages is a quick and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m34s)



[easy way to get going with it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m38s)



[so with this said when you first come to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m39s)



[uh oh yeah great when you come to a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m42s)



[repository and you want to get involved](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m47s)



[typically the first thing that you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m49s)



[going to want to end up doing is forking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m50s)



[it this is ultimately](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m52s)



[and for in this case I'm going to fork](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m54s)



[it to my own personal account so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h16m56s)



[terminology here the repository itself](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m00s)



[is then going to basically have two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m04s)



[copies so there there's a very blurry](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m07s)



[line here when we talk about git and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m09s)



[github because git is the underlying](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m11s)



[source control that's being used and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m14s)



[github is built on top of that and so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m16s)



[sometimes it's very easy to or easy to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m19s)



[mix the what is get proper and what is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m24s)



[github feature because there are other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m27s)



[websites that host get repositories](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m29s)



[bitbucket as your devops being probably](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m32s)



[the two other biggest options and they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m34s)



[all have similar features or different](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m37s)



[features but really it is the same kind](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m40s)



[of source control so in this case we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m43s)



[have a repository when we fork the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m45s)



[repository what that says is okay I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m47s)



[would like my own copy of this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m49s)



[repository so I'm gonna jump publish in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m51s)



[to close that other web page and I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m54s)



[gonna jump over to mine real quick so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m56s)



[the important thing to note is now this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h17m58s)



[is under my account so before we were](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m00s)



[under in teletext samples Octoberfest](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m03s)



[and github is keeping track and knowing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m05s)



[hey you know this is a a fork of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m07s)



[original repository but now this is this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m10s)



[is my copy for all intensive purposes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m12s)



[this is mine](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m14s)



[I control all the branches I control all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m16s)



[of the changes let's see does a fork](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m18s)



[copy files or just link to the master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m22s)



[repo mostly functionally think of it as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m24s)



[a copy it is not is not actually a link](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m30s)



[back so I believe under the covers](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m33s)



[there's some fancy stuff that github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m36s)



[does to avoid having to like just blind](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m37s)



[copy everything but functionally from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m39s)



[your perspective everything is a full](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m42s)



[copy so when you create a fork you get a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m43s)



[full copy of everything so any branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m46s)



[that the original repository has you get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m49s)



[a copy of those can you can delete those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m51s)



[branches on your fork it cuz again it is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m53s)



[up to you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m56s)



[you'll also notice then you get access](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m56s)



[to a bunch more tabs along the top of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h18m58s)



[you can now control settings and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m00s)



[securities and things that's not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m02s)



[available to other use](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m04s)



[because this is your repository you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m06s)



[add collaborators and and do various](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m09s)



[things with your fork so functionally it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m11s)



[is a full copy okay next step we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m14s)



[actually want to do some work with this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m18s)



[now given that these are just markdown](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m19s)



[files we could just edit these in the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m22s)



[browser github gives us a nice little](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m23s)



[edit button unfortunately doing that I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m26s)



[think hides a lot of the get interaction](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m28s)



[and takes away from what I'm hoping to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m30s)



[show and most of the time when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m34s)



[making changes just editing things in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m35s)



[the browser isn't quite sufficient if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m38s)



[you're if you're just making a few like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m40s)



[spelling mistake fixes yeah it works](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m41s)



[great but a lot of times we need to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m43s)



[something slightly more advanced than](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m46s)



[that or at least verify that our changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m48s)



[don't break anything else once we do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m50s)



[them so the next step is you want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m51s)



[actually clone the repository now we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m55s)



[could have cloned the original](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m57s)



[repository as well okay so clone or](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h19m59s)



[download is sort of conceptually you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m02s)



[think of it as kind of like a fork](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m06s)



[because ultimately get the source](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m08s)



[control is a distributed system so every](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m11s)



[copy of the repository is both a client](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m14s)



[and a server now some source controls](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m18s)



[you've got like the this master server](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m20s)



[that controls everything with get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m22s)



[everyone's a master everyone can assume](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m24s)



[you have permissions everyone can push](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m27s)



[and pull to any other copy of this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m28s)



[repository with github they kind of take](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m30s)



[away that distributed system and say](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m35s)



[well yes it's all distributed but we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m36s)



[want to be sort of the the central hub](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m38s)



[as it were out on the internet that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m40s)



[everyone pushes and pulls from that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m42s)



[that's the idea there so when you clone](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m45s)



[you're making a copy of your repository](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m48s)



[from the server down on your local](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m51s)



[machine so and again we could go over](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m53s)



[here and you'll notice I've got the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m57s)



[clone button on both the intelligent](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h20m58s)



[copy of the repository as well as my own](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m00s)



[personal one because you can clone from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m03s)



[either the difference being that unless](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m04s)



[you have permissions if you clone from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m07s)



[here you're not going to be able to push](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m10s)



[back up to that repository any of your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m11s)



[changes whereas the one on my personal](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m13s)



[account I will have permission to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m15s)



[through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m17s)



[push those changes back up so what we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m18s)



[are going to do is we are going to copy](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m20s)



[this guy and then go over to everybody's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m23s)



[favorite tool get cracking boom so when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m25s)



[you when you first open up get cracking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m30s)



[you're going to be greeted with a screen](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m32s)



[kind of like this the favorites and the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m33s)



[recent repositories will probably be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m35s)



[empty but in our case what we want to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m36s)



[is we want to clone a repository and I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m40s)



[and again I think several of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m44s)



[options here are Pro only features](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m47s)



[github Enterprise and as your DevOps I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m48s)



[believe are I think one of these other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m52s)



[ones is as well I don't remember exactly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m54s)



[which well we can go over to github and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m55s)



[in my case I want to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h21m58s)



[Oktoberfest demo and unfortunately](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m01s)



[because I'm a part of the IntelliJ org I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m04s)



[can see this here in general if you just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m06s)



[fork some arbitrary repository out on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m09s)



[the internet it won't show up in your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m12s)



[list it'll just be on this one there is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m14s)



[a step that I am skipping over here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m16s)



[where I've actually connected up get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m18s)



[cracking to my to my github account so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m23s)



[there is a underneath preferences](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m26s)



[underneath authentication when you go to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m29s)



[github you actually need to actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m32s)



[there'll be a connect button it'll walk](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m38s)



[you through an OAuth process to actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m40s)



[connect up your get crackin to your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m42s)



[github account ok so once you've done](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m46s)



[that then you should actually wrong](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m49s)



[button clone a repository then you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m51s)



[should get something similar to this so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m54s)



[in our case hacked over fest and I am](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m57s)



[going to pick this guy and see : dev](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h22m59s)



[Oktoberfest demo sounds like a great](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m03s)



[folder so we are going to clone it and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m05s)



[then we are going to open it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m07s)



[and boof so this is a very boring](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m11s)



[repository right now it has only a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m15s)



[single commit and not a lot of changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m17s)



[but this is a a good time to go over](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m19s)



[what a commit actually is so as you make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m22s)



[incremental changes the the individual](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m26s)



[commits or buckets of your changes are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m28s)



[just deltas to files so what's actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m30s)



[being stored here is on the readme MD](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m33s)



[file these additions were made so get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m36s)



[cracking colors additions and green](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m40s)



[deletions in red and so it sees this as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m42s)



[a brand new file so all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m45s)



[was at it same with the license file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m47s)



[brand new stuff all the way through](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m49s)



[right so in our case we're going to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m51s)



[through and edit this file and I'm just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m54s)



[going to do it straight and get crackin](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m57s)



[so I don't have to switch into any other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h23m58s)



[tools and updating to show changes okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m00s)



[we are going to save that file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m09s)



[okay so now in the the main window and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m14s)



[this is actually worth noting I kind of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m17s)



[went through that quick but there is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m19s)



[whenever you have a view open and get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m21s)



[crackin be aware there's this little X](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m24s)



[it's not all the way up in the top](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m26s)



[right-hand corner it's kind of floating](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m28s)



[in just this middle section indicating](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m30s)



[you're just gonna close this and go back](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m31s)



[to the main view a lot of using get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m33s)



[cracking just populate kind of this main](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m35s)



[central area but now it shows that we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m38s)



[got some work in progress that's what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m42s)



[WIP stands for and if we select it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m44s)



[because you can pick on which commit it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m47s)



[was that you want to do you can see that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m50s)



[the changes have been to the readme](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m52s)



[markdown file in get cracking you'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m54s)



[notice these little dotted lines](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m56s)



[indicate something that that could be a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h24m58s)



[commit all of the circles represent a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m00s)



[full commit but the little dotted lines](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m03s)



[basically are just the I'm probably](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m05s)



[going to be a commit right so with get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m08s)



[to create a commit you have to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m13s)



[through and select what changes you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m15s)



[actually want to put into that commit so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m17s)



[because a commit is just a bunch of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m20s)



[deltas to files we get to determine](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m22s)



[which deltas and which files we're going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m24s)



[to actually include in that so in this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m26s)



[case we can click on the file and it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m28s)



[shows us hey look there's this single](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m30s)



[addition to the file great we're going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m32s)



[to stage that file or we could hit stage](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m34s)



[all changes either one will do the same](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m36s)



[thing and the file now moves from the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m38s)



[unstaged files down to the stage files](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m40s)



[the stage files are going to be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m42s)



[everything that is going to go as part](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m44s)



[of that commit for those of you who like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m47s)



[the command line stuff this is the git](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m50s)



[add command as is roughly what this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m52s)



[doing here and then down here we we have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m55s)



[a message now the git Krakens GUI is a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h25m57s)



[little different and actually I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m01s)



[realizing that that is covering up with](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m03s)



[my move this over here just so my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m06s)



[my little video overlay doesn't get in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m10s)



[the way do something more like that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m13s)



[okay so get Krakens GUI is a little bit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m18s)



[different than a lot of other clients](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m22s)



[they they keep track of both a summary](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m25s)



[in a description now under the hood](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m27s)



[there's really no difference between](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m29s)



[these when you look at the git commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m30s)



[it's really first line the second line](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m32s)



[or I guess first line and all the other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m35s)



[lines of what I want to type and you'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m37s)



[notice this little 72 number here what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m40s)



[get crackin is noting is that a lot of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m42s)



[times in in many tools you when it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m45s)



[displaying a commit it will only show](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m48s)



[you the first X number of characters and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m49s)



[then everything else goes into a second](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m51s)



[line so get cracking tries to force you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m53s)



[down this idea of your first line should](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m55s)



[be a short description of what it is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h26m57s)



[whereas the description could be a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m00s)



[longer one so for example updated readme](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m01s)



[added useful text please do not take](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m08s)



[these messages as examples of what is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m13s)



[useful in a commit message this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m15s)



[horrible but when your changes are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m16s)



[updating to show changes it's really](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m21s)



[hard to come up with a useful commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m24s)



[message about what was changed so and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m25s)



[then we are going to do commit changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m28s)



[okay so you'll notice our little dotted](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m30s)



[circle has now become a filled in circle](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m33s)



[and get cracking has my user information](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m35s)



[so it's populated it with some](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m39s)



[information about me when it occurred](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m41s)



[and what changes you're in here so as we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m42s)



[click through here we can see okay here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m45s)



[are the changes that are in each commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m47s)



[and it's important to note that we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m49s)



[now got two of these master pointers](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m50s)



[here so in get everything revolves](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m54s)



[around branching and you'll see people](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m57s)



[talking about making branches rebasing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h27m59s)



[branches merging branches everything is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m01s)



[a branch and what that really comes down](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m04s)



[to is a branch is one of these labels](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m07s)



[pointed out a particular commit and so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m09s)



[when you are on a branch that means as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m12s)



[you make changes that branch is going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m15s)



[increment with you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m18s)



[but what then is the difference between](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m20s)



[this master branch and this master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m22s)



[branch so this one down here is the one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m24s)



[that's pointed at origin did a sari](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m27s)



[unknown soldier' I think my stream Labs](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m34s)



[thing deleted something it's really](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m36s)



[unfortunate that it goes to and blows](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m40s)



[out history so I what that message was](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m41s)



[you might have to type it again it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m43s)



[it's a language filter is unusual I need](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m45s)



[to figure out how to configure it better](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m50s)



[because it picks up stuff that doesn't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m51s)



[always make sense to me](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m54s)



[this master one is where the the master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h28m57s)



[branch is out on my fork out on github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m01s)



[so if I were to go and look you'll note](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m03s)



[all the commits have this little ID](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m06s)



[that's associated with it this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m07s)



[actually a shortened version of it it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m09s)



[these goods are fairly long I think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m11s)



[there are 32 characters but typically](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m13s)



[you only need about 6 to get a unique ID](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m16s)



[and so you'll notice each of these are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m20s)



[separate different commits and the one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m23s)



[out on github is pointed at this old one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m25s)



[but my local one is down here yeah I've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m28s)



[seen that a couple times there's certain](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m33s)



[symbols that the stream lab stuff gets](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m35s)



[its weirded out on I really don't like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m39s)



[how it wipes all the history I wish you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m40s)



[would just like stop at one I'm very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m43s)



[close to going and turning it off](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m48s)



[because most of the time it it's not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m49s)



[adding value and just being confusing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m51s)



[so at this point we have two choices](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m55s)



[because our local version of look and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h29m57s)



[don't hit the undo button because that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m01s)



[will undo what you just did so now we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m04s)



[got our local branch that's one commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m08s)



[ahead and our remote branch which is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m10s)



[behind us so get cracking and this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m13s)



[let me make this bigger be big so get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m17s)



[cracking denotes this by putting in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m21s)



[scroll that to the side by putting in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m23s)



[this little number and an up arrow](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m26s)



[indicating that you're your local master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m28s)



[branch is one commit ahead and so when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m31s)



[you push you're going to be sending up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m34s)



[one commit to the remote server okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m35s)



[so let's go through and push and this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m39s)



[the the sort of the basic workflow of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m45s)



[get that that a lot of people will walk](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m47s)



[you through is you make changes you do a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m49s)



[commit you push and then you may need to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m51s)



[make other changes okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m53s)



[let's go back and actually bring this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m58s)



[kind of back around to Oktoberfest and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h30m59s)



[get that a little better](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m03s)



[so back on the main repo there is an](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m05s)



[issue that I opened and you'll notice I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m08s)



[tagged it as good first issue just so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m11s)



[that I know that it is a useful one for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m12s)



[me to do and normally an issue would](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m15s)



[have a helpful description here mine](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m19s)



[does not because I was in a hurry and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m21s)



[this was the first thing that came to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m23s)



[mind but the title of it says the readme](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m24s)



[needs it more needs to be more](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m27s)



[descriptive and helpful because if we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m29s)



[look at the readme this readme is not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m31s)



[descriptive or helpful okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m33s)



[so what we are going to do is we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m37s)



[actually want to we want to take this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m39s)



[issue and say hey I I would like to work](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m42s)



[on it so typically for github repos you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m45s)



[can't actually assign yourself to the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m49s)



[issue unless you're a member of the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m51s)



[the org or the owner has added you to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m53s)



[the repo but it's sort of usually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h31m56s)



[considered best practice to just say](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m00s)



[something like I can work on this which](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m03s)



[is great that way other people know that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m07s)



[that somebody's actively working on this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m09s)



[and you know you don't get people](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m11s)



[duplicating worker and wasting time so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m12s)



[again this is this is not a rule by any](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m15s)



[stretch of the imagination different](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m17s)



[repositories have different contributing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m19s)



[guidelines so if you see a contributors](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m21s)



[or contributing MD file read it first](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m25s)



[but again it is usually best to just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m28s)



[comment or if you're gonna pick up an](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m31s)



[issue that's not labeled as good first](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m33s)



[issue even just a simple question of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m34s)



[saying hey any objection if I pick this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m37s)



[up this is the good direction to go yada](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m38s)



[yada yada but we're gonna fix this so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m41s)



[the key part is we need to know issue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m43s)



[number one okay so we're gonna go down](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m44s)



[here now we have a bit of a problem is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m48s)



[we've updated our readme and so my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m50s)



[master branch here is pointed to this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m54s)



[commit six five zero seven four six](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h32m58s)



[right this commit down here 86'd 55:31](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m00s)



[is the initial commit and that's also](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m06s)



[the commit that the main and teletext](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m08s)



[back at okay so eight six d five three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m12s)



[one you'll notice github is showing one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m18s)



[additional digit get cracking shortens](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m21s)



[it but the same commit so our repository](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m24s)



[is now actually ahead of where the other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m28s)



[repository is at which isn't great for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m32s)



[us because ultimately what we want to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m35s)



[is we want to make a change to the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m37s)



[current state of this readme we don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m41s)



[want to make a change to the current](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m43s)



[state of our readme which if we refresh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m44s)



[here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m47s)



[has this extra change because ultimately](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m49s)



[we're looking to change the one on the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m52s)



[main repository not the one on our Fork](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m53s)



[okay so what we want to do is we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m56s)



[actually want to create a branch to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h33m59s)



[this work on and again everything in git](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m02s)



[revolves around branching strategies and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m04s)



[how do i branch and how do i merge and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m06s)



[so the key part is always understanding](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m09s)



[where do you branch from so in this case](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m11s)



[we want to branch from wherever that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m14s)



[wherever this main repository is at](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m16s)



[right so here's what I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m19s)



[just to make my life easy you don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m21s)



[necessarily have to do this if you know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m23s)



[which commit to be on great but I this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m25s)



[is the way I find it to be most easy so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m28s)



[if you come over to this clone or](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m31s)



[download and I'm just gonna hit the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m32s)



[little copy button here and then I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m34s)



[gonna come back over here and I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m37s)



[add an additional remote so if I do I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m38s)



[gonna actually do it as URL because I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m43s)



[don't know if github would actually work](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m45s)



[for everybody so I'm gonna just call](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m46s)



[this remote Intelli Tech and I'm going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m49s)



[to paste the same that URL in right here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m51s)



[for both the poll in the push and push](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m55s)



[obviously you won't have permission to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h34m58s)



[do but that's fine](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m00s)



[so you'll notice now down here I have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m01s)



[two remotes that are showing and this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m04s)



[little eyeball think if you want to hide](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m07s)



[some of these tags up here you can just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m09s)



[openly click to hide them from the graph](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m12s)



[and also clicking on one of these things](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m14s)



[here these are actually a tree view that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m17s)



[you can collapse which is great because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m19s)



[this list can get quite long but you'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m21s)



[notice now I have an intelligent master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m23s)



[so I've now got three master branches at](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m25s)



[play I've got the Intel attack master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m27s)



[branch I've got my github 's on my fork](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m30s)



[its master branch and then I've got my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m35s)



[local master branch so all the same name](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m37s)



[three different branches which are again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m40s)



[a branch is just a label pointed at a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m43s)



[commit so to fix that issue on the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m45s)



[IntelliJ altom utley what I want to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m48s)



[is I want to create a branch and I want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m51s)



[it to start from this state the state of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m52s)



[in teletext master branch which I can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m55s)



[see is this one right here so and get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m57s)



[cracking you can always just click on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h35m59s)



[the branch and it'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m00s)



[take it to you and select it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m01s)



[demonstration so if you click here it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m03s)



[will select it over here and then what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m06s)



[you can do is right click on this and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m07s)



[say create branch here so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m09s)



[call it fix issue one okay so the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m12s)



[important thing to note is when I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m18s)



[created a branch that gave me a new](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m19s)



[effectively branch label pointed at this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m22s)



[commit it's got the little computer](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m24s)



[symbol next to it which means this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m27s)



[branch exists on my computer only this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m28s)



[doesn't exist on github anywhere this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m30s)



[just my my branch no changes right so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m32s)



[we're gonna go back over here and I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m36s)



[going to say okay I'm gonna I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m37s)



[pick on the readme MD file and the issue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m39s)



[itself to do so that's something about](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m42s)



[making this more descriptive and helpful](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m45s)



[so we need to make the readme more](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m48s)



[descriptive and helpful great to teach](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m50s)



[get this repository is designed is for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h36m53s)



[Oktoberfest](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m05s)



[contributing to open source software is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m08s)



[fun okay I think that is helpful and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m11s)



[better so we save the file and you'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m17s)



[notice now we've got this little dotted](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m20s)



[arrow and a dotted circle up here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m23s)



[showing work-in-progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m24s)



[so this says this is this is the current](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m26s)



[work that's being done but it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m29s)



[important to note the branch that it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m30s)



[coming off of and the the branch with](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m32s)



[the little checkbox is the branch that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m34s)



[I'm currently on okay or the head of my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m36s)



[branch as it were so I've got these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m40s)



[changes here and actually let's go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m42s)



[through and I want to just stage it so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m45s)



[we will we will stage these changes down](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m50s)



[here great fix for issue 1 added a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h37m52s)



[better description to the readme ok so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m00s)



[I've gone through and I have staged the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m08s)



[changes I typed in the description and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m11s)



[we're just going to go through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m13s)



[create a new commit so commit changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m14s)



[and you'll notice the pointer for my fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m18s)



[issue 1 branch has advanced to where it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m21s)



[should be but if we go back down the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m24s)



[line and follow it we can see that it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m26s)



[was initially based upon this master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m28s)



[branch here ok but once again this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m31s)



[branch doesn't exist out on my github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m33s)



[yet this little computer symbol means it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m35s)



[only exists locally for me so I'm going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m38s)



[to push this branch up to the server so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m41s)



[it's asking hey you know you said to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m44s)



[push this to the server where should it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m47s)



[go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m49s)



[and it goes hey I think I think you want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m50s)



[to go to origin which is my fork which](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m52s)



[is correct in theory if you have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m54s)



[permission you could push to the other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m56s)



[one but most of the time you won't and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h38m58s)



[then what do you want the branch to be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m00s)



[called out on github so I could you know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m02s)



[something else and you could do this you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m06s)



[could have a local branch named fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m09s)



[issue one and have the remote branch out](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m11s)



[on github be named you know my other fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m13s)



[please don't do this it will only add to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m17s)



[your confusion in general the best thing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m20s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m23s)



[make the names match just because they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m23s)



[can be different doesn't mean they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m26s)



[should and in the interest of sanity](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m27s)



[name them the same that way as you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m29s)



[looking at labels here and there it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m33s)



[makes more sense okay okay so we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m35s)



[pushed the issue up and you'll notice a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m39s)



[couple changes here so one I now have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m41s)



[well success message which is good but](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m43s)



[I've now got two little labels here so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m46s)



[one showing that it's out on origin](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m50s)



[which is my github fork and you will see](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m53s)



[it in the list here and then also my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m56s)



[local one down here because again my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h39m58s)



[local one and the remote one can be in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m00s)



[two different states okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m02s)



[and now we actually want to contribute](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m06s)



[this back because making the fix on my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m08s)



[local fork pushing it up to my local](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m10s)



[fork is nice but that doesn't actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m12s)



[contribute anything back to the original](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m14s)



[repository so let's go down here and we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m16s)



[are going to jump back to mine and so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m19s)



[you'll notice when you open it up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m23s)



[github very helpfully says hey would you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m24s)



[like to make a pull request the answer](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m27s)



[is yes and then the next question should](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m28s)



[be what is a pull request we are going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m30s)



[to look as the name implies it is a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m33s)



[request for the original author or the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m35s)



[person who you're sending this into to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m40s)



[say hey please take in my changes I made](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m42s)



[some changes I'd really like for you to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m45s)



[add them to your repository so the key](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m46s)



[thing to note here is the base](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m49s)



[repository and the head repository so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m50s)



[the base repository this little arrow is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m53s)



[a clue let me see if I make this bigger](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m55s)



[this is the direction of the changes so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h40m58s)



[my repository over here target](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m00s)



[repository over here this is the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m03s)



[direction the changes are going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m05s)



[yeah merge requests would make sense so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m08s)



[github is somewhat old ish in technology](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m11s)



[terms it's kind of old I guess](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m18s)



[and there are a lot of kind of oddities](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m20s)



[in the terminology and really what it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m23s)



[comes down to is memorize the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m27s)



[terminology because there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m28s)



[people stuck with it and people don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m31s)



[want it to change Oh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m33s)



[Mountain Dew I've missed thee okay so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m37s)



[before you make a pull request always](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m41s)



[double-check these it's always important](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m42s)



[to to pay attention to okay is this the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m44s)



[repository that I expect yes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m47s)



[is this the branch where I actually did](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m49s)



[the work yes is this where I want it to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m50s)



[go in this case the the master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m52s)



[over on in teletext version yes that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m56s)



[where where I want it to go it's worth](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h41m58s)



[noting some repositories don't like pull](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m00s)



[requests into master sometimes they've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m03s)



[got you know say you know Version three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m05s)



[Oh branch or whatever that they're doing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m07s)



[all their current work on and they want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m10s)



[you to merge into that branch instead so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m12s)



[pay attention if the repository that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m15s)



[you've forked is requesting that you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m17s)



[make changes targeting a different](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m20s)



[branch because this does matter okay and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m22s)



[it's a great way to get your pull](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m25s)



[request just reject it outright if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m26s)



[don't pay attention again watch those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m28s)



[contributing MD files because if there](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m30s)



[are things like that that's where](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m34s)



[they'll be specified otherwise usually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m35s)



[the master branch if you're unsure is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m37s)



[the correct place to go okay so we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m39s)



[scroll down we look and we verify are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m42s)



[these the changes that we expect yep](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m44s)



[that makes sense so I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m46s)



[through and do this and we are going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m48s)



[make a pull request](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m51s)



[and this is what it ends up looking like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m54s)



[and so I'm going to switch hats real](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h42m58s)

[same user pretend like I've switched I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m08s)



[come in I look at the pull request ok](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m11s)



[great put it in a description I look at](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m14s)



[the files changed now I go this is close](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m16s)



[but I'd really like a change to this and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m21s)



[say you know what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m24s)



[can you move each sentence onto its own](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m26s)



[line pretty please](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m32s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m36s)



[so not rejecting the pull request but a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m38s)



[lot of times when you first submit one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m41s)



[odds of it being accepted the first time](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m43s)



[might be a little low and there's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m46s)



[usually a little bit of back-and-forth](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m48s)



[this is not a bad thing at all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m49s)



[repository maintainer czar expected to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m52s)



[make sure that things meet a minimum bar](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m55s)



[of quality make sure if things follow](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m57s)



[particular style guidelines obviously](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h43m59s)



[the closer you are the the closer you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m01s)



[get to those the first try it makes it a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m03s)



[lot easier on us but usually there's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m05s)



[some sort of feedback okay and so then](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m08s)



[the question becomes okay I've now got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m11s)



[this comment on on this change how do I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m14s)



[update a pull request so it's important](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m16s)



[to note that a pull request doesn't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m18s)



[actually contain any data itself so when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m21s)



[you're looking at these files changed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m24s)



[the pull request has no concept about](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m25s)



[what files have changed the pull request](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m28s)



[literally contains two pieces of data](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m30s)



[the source repository and branch and the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m31s)



[target repository and branch so if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m35s)



[somebody requests changes you don't need](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m37s)



[to actually update your pull request](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m39s)



[what you need to do is update your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m40s)



[branch that contains the changes okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m42s)



[that's that's usually something where I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m44s)

[it's oh well how do I go and update my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m48s)

[flows through so let's go through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h44m56s)

[line so we're gonna go through and put](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m11s)



[each sentence on its own line and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m14s)



[because it's marked down we're gonna put](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m16s)



[one blank line between it for reasons](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m17s)

[three okay great we will stage this file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m35s)



[let's see moved sentences onto their own](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m41s)



[line right okay so we will go through](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m47s)



[and create a commit and once again we'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m51s)



[note that the the local branch is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m54s)



[advanced by one it's now ahead of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h45m58s)



[github one let's see so question do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m01s)

[video I'm not always paying attention to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m39s)



[my preview down here okay so we need to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m40s)



[get this change back up to github to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m46s)



[update our our branch so we're going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m48s)



[push this change up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m50s)



[and now our github repository has been](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m55s)



[updated so if we go back to the pull](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h46m59s)



[request and we hit refresh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m01s)



[you'll notice this has now been changed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m10s)



[and it now shows it like this with the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m13s)



[updated changes again I didn't have to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m16s)



[make any changes to my poll request all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m18s)



[I did was update my branch and because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m19s)



[the poll request just says which branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m22s)



[to come from and which branch to go to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m24s)



[the change now shows up automatically](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m26s)



[okay and you'll notice now if we look in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m29s)



[the the files changed github is actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m34s)



[fairly intelligent and knows ok the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m37s)



[comment was originally on this line the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m39s)



[person went through and made a change to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m42s)



[that line therefore I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m43s)



[show the comment anymore at least in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m44s)



[this view that comments probably been](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m46s)



[resolved ok and then at this point](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m49s)



[somebody can look at it and go that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m53s)



[great and they can go ahead and merge it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m55s)



[in I'm just gonna cheat and click this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h47m57s)



[button here because this is what people](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m00s)



[should do we'll get to what that button](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m02s)



[does in just a minute ok normally you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m05s)



[don't necessarily have access to this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m10s)



[because I own both repositories github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m12s)



[is giving me the option of deleting the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m16s)



[source branch usually the maintainer can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m17s)



[do that usually ok so let's go back and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m19s)



[look at this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m25s)



[so now we will notice a few things have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m28s)



[happened so our history tree is starting](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m30s)



[to get a little bit more interesting so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m34s)



[we'll note that we've now got a new](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m36s)



[commit out on IntelliJ sir](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m39s)



[so it's now up here because this is the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m42s)



[the merged in changes you'll know this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m45s)



[just shows the the latest set complete](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m48s)



[set of changes basically the combined](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m51s)



[set of these two things our master is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m52s)



[over here and now we've got this fixed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m57s)



[issue one so now we've got a couple](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h48m59s)



[things that we could go through and do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m02s)



[so normally what you want to do is for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m03s)



[your own sanity is keep your master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m09s)



[branch in sync with the main master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m11s)



[branch of whatever you're contributing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m14s)



[to you don't have to do this because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m15s)



[you'll notice I was just if you've added](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m18s)



[the extra remote you can just instantly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m20s)



[go through and start creating commits](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m22s)



[off of this and be fine I usually like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m24s)



[to keep mine synced up so we're going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m27s)



[go through that so I'm going to switch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m29s)



[branches so what this means with the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m31s)



[concept of switching branches is the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m34s)



[branch that git is tracking when I make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m38s)



[changes is now the master branch so if I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m40s)



[if I go through and say I'm going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m45s)



[edit this which will just do this real](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m46s)



[quick](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m49s)



[phoo safe you'll note this is the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m53s)



[original file without our updated](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m56s)



[changes because we are back on my master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h49m58s)



[branch you'll note it's now showing okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m02s)



[I'm now going to start adding a commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m06s)



[up here get cracking tries to show](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m09s)



[everything chronologically because git](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m11s)



[is inherently kind of messy to show the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m13s)



[history because history and git is not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m16s)



[always linear you can kind of see how](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m18s)



[these lines start to criss cross and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m21s)



[merge back and forth and it can get very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m23s)



[ugly and messy at times to figure out](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m26s)



[where to go so this is really what it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m28s)



[showing it okay so we are going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m31s)



[actually discard these changes because I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m35s)



[don't want them well what I want to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m37s)



[is take my master branch and resync it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m40s)



[up to the intelligent master branch so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m43s)



[the the easiest thing that I can do is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m47s)



[when I'm on my current master branch if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m49s)



[I have no changes this is important if I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m52s)



[have no changes I can simply right-click](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m54s)



[on Intelli tech master and say rebase](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h50m58s)



[okay so what is actually happening here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m02s)



[so we have Intel attacks master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m07s)



[and my master branch right when you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m09s)



[rebase it's looking at what is the base](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m13s)



[of your branch so in this case follow](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m16s)



[the the history backwards until these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m19s)



[branches merge together so this initial](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m21s)



[commit is the source of both of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m23s)



[right and so what it's doing is it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m25s)



[going through and saying okay you want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m27s)



[this branch rebased on top of Intel](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m29s)



[attacks master branch I need to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m32s)



[through and replay these deltas on top](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m35s)



[of here so what it does is it switches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m38s)



[to that other branch and then starts](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m41s)

[replaying those deltas so when you're in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m45s)



[the process of a rebase and it's going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m48s)



[through and replaying these deltas it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m50s)



[goes hold on on the first set of changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m52s)



[you edited the readme file but on an](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m54s)



[teletext master that readme file has](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h51m58s)



[already been changed I don't know what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m00s)



[to do no because git is fairly good if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m02s)



[two people edit disparate areas of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m04s)



[same file or two different](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m05s)



[it just figures it out and goes ah I got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m07s)



[you but in this case it's two people](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m09s)



[edited the exact same section of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m12s)



[file what do we do so in this case it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m14s)



[comes in here and says okay let's try](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m16s)



[and figure this out and I'm pretty sure](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m18s)



[what I'm about to show you is to get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m19s)



[cracking Pro feature don't quote me on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m21s)



[that but I'm pretty sure it is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m23s)



[as we can go through and say okay which](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m25s)



[of these changes do I want do I want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m28s)



[this change do I want both of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m30s)



[changes and you'll notice order that I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m32s)



[click these matters do I want to take](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m34s)



[and I'm gonna I'm gonna uncheck this the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m38s)



[key thing to note is this bottom section](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m40s)



[is showing the result of doing this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m42s)



[merge so for example I could say I want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m43s)



[this line followed by this line then](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m46s)



[we're gonna do the blank line and then](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m48s)



[this line down here and this is this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m50s)



[how we're gonna make this merge work](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m51s)



[it's like okay let's do that and again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m52s)



[usually you don't have complicated](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m55s)



[merges like this usually you it's oh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m57s)



[yeah no I really wanted this the other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h52m59s)



[thing you can do and I'm gonna just do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m03s)



[this real quick because why not do the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m05s)



[complicated one is and this right](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m07s)



[so usually you don't want to sneak in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m14s)



[extra changes but sometimes when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m16s)



[editing this these types of merges you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m17s)



[need some extra change to make sure you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m20s)



[don't break the code or whatever so we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m22s)



[hit save and then we go okay continue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m24s)



[rebase so continue replaying those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m27s)



[commits in this case there was only one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m29s)



[that's fine so what ended up happening](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m31s)



[we've gotten teletext master branch and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m33s)



[then we've got my local master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m36s)



[down here right so my local branch has](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m38s)



[now been rebased so the base of it is no](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m42s)



[longer this initial commit this can this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m45s)



[base connecting line here is now going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m48s)



[down here you can sort of think of base](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m50s)



[as where does the line coming out of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m52s)



[bottom of the commit go so the line](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m54s)



[coming out of the bottom of this commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m57s)



[initially went here I rebased it here so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h53m58s)



[now this line connects right here okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m00s)



[so visually and functionally that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m03s)



[what's happening but again these commits](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m05s)



[are just deltas of individual files so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m07s)



[when we look at this we go okay what is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m10s)



[the Delta ah because we merged in our](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m11s)



[change here and we added this extra line](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m15s)



[the Delta of this commit is now the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m18s)



[addition of these two lines okay great](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m20s)



[and that brings us up to here so the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m23s)



[other thing that you can do so that's a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m28s)



[basically an effective rebase usually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m31s)



[you end up having to rebase when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m33s)



[working with another repository and a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m37s)



[branch has moved and you want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m39s)



[effectively put your commits on top of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m41s)



[it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m43s)



[so you can imagine that if we had done](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m43s)



[this pull request and it sat here for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m46s)



[two months eventually what would](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m48s)



[probably end up happening is you know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m51s)



[there's now merge conflicts as other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m53s)



[changes in people's commits get merged](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m55s)



[in and so the owner magus say hey I'd](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h54m57s)



[love to take these changes but the codes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m00s)



[moved on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m02s)



[can you rebase your changes onto the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m03s)



[latest stuff so that I can see what they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m05s)



[actually need to be great so you rebase](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m07s)



[you probably deal with some conflicts](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m11s)



[and away you go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m13s)



[okay the other thing you can do is you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m14s)



[can just actually take these branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m16s)



[pointers pick them up and move them](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m18s)



[around and drop them right so what we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m20s)



[gonna do real quick is we are going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m22s)



[take our current master and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m24s)



[push that up to github so you'll notice](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m28s)



[over here on get crackin it's it's a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m30s)



[little bit confused it's saying well if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m33s)



[I compare where your local master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m35s)



[is to your remote master branch I've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m37s)



[one commit that I need to bring down and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m40s)



[I've got two that I want to send up and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m42s)



[so it's a it's a little confused so if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m44s)



[we just go push it's going to end up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m47s)



[giving us an error going hang on you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m49s)



[can't push because you're actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m51s)



[behind there's changes out on the server](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m53s)



[that you don't have locally so you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m54s)



[try and do a pull but then you're gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h55m57s)



[run into conflicts right because when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m00s)



[you rebase you've effectively changed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m03s)



[history because the way the history](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m05s)



[looks out on the server is you've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m07s)



[this one Delta here that was based on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m10s)



[this so what you can do and be very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m13s)



[careful with this button is force push](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m16s)



[basically you're telling the the github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m18s)



[server no no no ignore where you think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m21s)



[the branch pointer should be trust me my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m24s)



[local ones in the right state this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m26s)



[actually a wonderful thing about git you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m28s)



[can clone a repository do all of your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m31s)



[your stuff and get cracking that you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m34s)



[want move the branches around and make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m36s)



[sure you get your local setup exactly as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m38s)



[it should look and then push okay and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m40s)



[you can just tell the server no no trust](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m43s)



[me I've moved the stuff around where it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m45s)



[should be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m47s)



[ignore your current state I've got it in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m48s)



[a good state it also means that if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m50s)



[clone it and pull it down and you get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m51s)



[yourself really messed up and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m53s)



[everything's broken and you don't know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m55s)



[what to do delete it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m56s)



[reclone and start again you don't push](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h56m58s)



[that that's the key thing to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m01s)



[so commit and push often when things are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m03s)



[in a working state and if they're in a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m05s)



[broken state revert don't don't push all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m08s)



[the way up so we'll get to revert in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m11s)



[just a moment so in this case what we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m13s)



[going to do is we're going to tell the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m15s)



[server no no ignore what you think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m16s)



[really this is where I want my master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m18s)



[branch to go so we are just going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m21s)



[force bush and it this is a destructive](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m22s)



[action](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m25s)



[yep do it because it's going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m26s)



[effectively end up throwing this commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m29s)



[away so that commit that that it was on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m31s)



[is no longer set it no longer exists and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m34s)



[so effectively that branch gets pruned](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m40s)



[off so question can you set a push to a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m41s)



[timer like an autosave so the answer is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m46s)



[yes technically no I wouldn't recommend](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m50s)



[doing it so I have seen some interesting](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h57m54s)



[ideas floated by people where they they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m00s)



[effectively go through and push every](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m03s)



[time something compiles and runs which](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m07s)



[is an interesting idea it's not the way](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m10s)



[it was designed to be used it's not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m13s)



[really meant to be hammered on that much](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m15s)



[and it's it's usually best if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m17s)



[manually decide hey I'm going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m21s)



[actually commit and push so a lot of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m23s)



[times what I end up doing is when things](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m25s)



[are in a good state the the best](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m28s)



[practice is to do as small incremental](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m30s)



[changes as you can and commit each one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m34s)



[of those as you go so whether that means](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m36s)



[it's a small bug fix whether you're just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m38s)



[adding a unit test that kind of thing if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m41s)



[it's a small incremental change and it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m43s)



[in a working state commit and you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m45s)



[choose to push so you can do multiple](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m48s)



[local commits and we will get to that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m50s)



[here in just a minute and you don't have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m53s)



[to necessarily push them all right away](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m56s)



[so for example we've got one local](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h58m58s)



[commit here and let's actually let's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m00s)



[walk through this because this is this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m03s)



[will make a great reset option so edit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m04s)



[file so we realized no this isn't the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m08s)



[change we want great save let's see](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m11s)



[removing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m17s)



[extra line so stage all changes this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m19s)



[we're just gonna delete this line here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m24s)



[great commit and then we realize oh no](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m26s)



[actually what I really wanted to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m30s)



[let's go back in here and edit again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m31s)



[updating your so changes we really this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m34s)



[is markdown we really want an empty line](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m36s)



[between this as well so we're gonna add](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m38s)



[this stage editing blank line boom and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m40s)



[so you'll notice now I've got my local](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m49s)



[master branch is now pushed to commits](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m51s)



[ahead of my my remote master branch and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m54s)



[this is perfectly fine it encourages you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m57s)



[to to make lots of commits put them on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=00h59m59s)



[branches because as long as you've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h00m03s)



[it sitting on a branch somewhere it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h00m05s)



[it's not lost as long as you can still](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h00m07s)

[switch branches and move around](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m40s)



[what git is going to do behind the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m42s)



[scenes is because it knows about all of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m44s)



[these Delta's it's going to go and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m45s)



[update all of your files to the state](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m47s)



[that they should be on that commit so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m49s)



[the hard part is if you want to have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m51s)



[effectively two branches open in an IDE](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h02m53s)

[contrast there's not a great way to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m00s)



[that again there are tools like get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m02s)



[extensions that add the idea of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m05s)



[workspaces we're where it effectively](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m06s)



[does that but it's it's not normal](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m08s)



[usually if you want to have two versions](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m13s)



[of the code open side by side what you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m15s)



[do is you clone into two separate](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m17s)



[folders basically give yourself two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m19s)



[copies of the repository when doing that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m21s)



[be careful](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m24s)



[it's bitten me many times where I have](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m25s)



[two clones of something and I think I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m27s)



[editing in one and I'm really in the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m29s)



[other and so try to like separate per](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m31s)



[monitor or name something obviously](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m34s)



[because it's it's very easy to get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m36s)



[confused and go back and forth and yeah](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m37s)



[there there is a get is very notorious](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m40s)



[for losing code very very notorious](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m43s)



[especially if you do things like force](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m46s)



[it is very easy to accidentally](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m50s)



[overwrite your data so again it's I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m52s)



[usually use the the github server as my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m55s)



[backup copy and then I'm perfectly happy](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h03m58s)



[to make destructive changes locally](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m01s)



[knowing that I can always reclone from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m03s)



[github if I get myself into a Lost State](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m05s)



[or I lose changes that I want I know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m07s)



[that they're they're saved up on github](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m10s)



[as long as I push them so usually before](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m12s)



[I do major like branch work I'll make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m14s)



[sure everything's pushed to github do it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m17s)



[all locally get it into the right state](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m19s)



[and then push again even if that means](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m21s)



[force post over the top because I can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m23s)



[work locally and make destructive](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m25s)



[changes knowing that I've got that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m27s)



[backup copy somewhere or even just make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m28s)



[a separate clone from github locally as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m31s)



[a backup on your local folder because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m33s)



[again when you clone your getting a full](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m35s)



[copy of the entire repository branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m37s)



[and everything so as long as you've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m39s)



[a copy of it somewhere you can always](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m42s)



[get it back](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m44s)



[okay to do yeah so it can be it can be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m46s)



[complex when you're tracking multiple](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m57s)



[branches and again it is especially when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h04m58s)



[you're dealing with something like I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m03s)



[know for the assignment that we did](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m07s)



[where we had multiple issues that we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m11s)



[were fixing basically making sure that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m13s)



[each issue is based upon the appropriate](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m15s)



[commits sorry about that unknown sailor](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m19s)



[I will go through I've had this problem](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m22s)



[now multiple weeks in a row I think I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m24s)



[gonna just turn that off but I need to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m26s)



[go and find where that setting is I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m29s)



[honestly turned it on several months ago](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m31s)



[and forgot where the button is so I need](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m33s)



[to go and spend a little time digging on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m36s)



[it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m37s)



[so but the short version is you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m40s)



[switch between branches just fine the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m42s)



[only thing I would say to try to avoid](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m44s)



[doing is if you're bouncing between](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m46s)



[branches and you've got work in progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m49s)



[changes it gets a little weird so for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m52s)



[example let's just demo that real quick](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m54s)



[so right so foo so I've got work in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h05m57s)



[progress changes back on my fix issue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m03s)



[one if I switch over to master we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m05s)



[gonna have a problem and get cracking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m10s)



[stops me because it says hey you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m12s)



[trying to switch but I've got changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m14s)



[here and I can't get a basically up this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m17s)



[Delta tree without this causing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m21s)



[conflicts you need to do something with](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m22s)



[these changes so if these are in a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m24s)



[different file so let's let's just throw](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m27s)



[these changes away real quick so we go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m30s)



[back let's let's let's muck with the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m33s)



[license file real quick right all right](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m35s)



[so we'll we'll change a different file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m39s)



[so once again I've got work in progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m41s)



[changes on my fix issue one and I go to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m43s)



[switch back to the master branch in this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m46s)



[case it is able to actually walk up all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m49s)



[of the deltas and go okay I can reapply](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m52s)



[this change at the top of the masters](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m54s)



[because you'll notice my work in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m57s)



[progress changes followed my my head](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h06m58s)



[branch or whichever branch that I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m00s)



[currently on right so now it's thinking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m02s)



[that these work in progress changes are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m05s)



[for the master branch not for my fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m07s)



[issue one and because there's no](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m09s)



[conflicts it has no time for me to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m10s)



[bounce back and forth](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m13s)



[see get er chat okay one second](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m15s)



[language filter is very touchy yes yes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m28s)



[very very much agreed again I clicked it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m31s)



[and I told it to take the defaults and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m37s)



[I'm thinking the defaults are something](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m39s)



[akin to g-rated I'm pretty sure that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m41s)



[what it is okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m44s)



[so if that all makes sense](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m49s)



[so I'm once again going to discard these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m51s)



[changes okay so resetting so we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m53s)



[worked our way up this we've got we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h07m59s)



[got two changes here and we realize oh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m01s)



[shoot I made this commit and I don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m04s)



[actually want it it's like well okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m06s)



[what do I do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m09s)



[I am currently on the master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m10s)



[that's important what you can do is you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m13s)



[can take this master branch and pick](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m16s)



[somewhere else in our history tree so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m18s)



[let's just go back one commit and we can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m20s)



[say reset so there are there are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m21s)



[multiple ways to do a reset there's soft](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m24s)



[which says okay keep my changes mixed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m27s)



[which is keep working copy but reset](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m30s)



[indexes and then hard which is just move](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m33s)



[the bloody branch pointer for me right](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m36s)



[now don't think just do it so let's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m39s)



[let's go through what each of those end](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m43s)



[up doing so we'll start at the top so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m44s)



[soft brings it back so my master pointer](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m48s)



[moved back 1 and it kept all of my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m52s)



[changes in the form of work-in-progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m55s)



[stuff so if we look at this oh great](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m57s)



[there's my changes now I did lose my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h08m59s)



[commit message but at least all of my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m01s)



[code changes are still there right so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m05s)



[again reset is something to be careful](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m07s)



[with but very useful so then let's go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m09s)



[back here so reset master this commits](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m13s)



[keep working copy and reset index so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m15s)



[effectively the oh because this isn't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m19s)



[pushed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m21s)



[yeah well we'll ignore it here so let's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m24s)



[put it back we'll come back to that one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m29s)



[in a minute because it's functionally](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m30s)



[it's the same thing because the branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m34s)

[aren't I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m39s)

[hard discard all changes this is the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m44s)



[by far the easiest way to pick up a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m47s)



[branch pointer and drop it down on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m49s)



[another commit this will literally pick](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m51s)



[your branch pointer up and put it down](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m53s)



[and say no no I really want you to point](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m54s)



[to this commit but by virtue of the way](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m57s)



[it works when we reset this branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h09m59s)



[pointer no other pointers are a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m01s)



[referencing this commit you can think of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m04s)



[a lot of the git history tree as a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m06s)

[this pointer back because nothing else](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m20s)



[is pointed to it it effectively is gone](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m23s)



[so if we go through reset master hard](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m25s)



[poof commit disappears](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m30s)

[aware it is it is some sometimes very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m36s)



[very dangerous for example if I said I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m40s)



[want to pick my master branch up and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m42s)



[darn it I want to set it over here reset](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m44s)



[master this commit hard boom](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m46s)



[I can I can pick up my master branch and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m49s)



[I can drop it down on this commit this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m51s)



[is another way of effectively if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m54s)



[want to take your local master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m56s)



[and bring it in sync with a remote](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h10m57s)



[master branch without doing a rebase](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m00s)



[this is an easy way to do it it's just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m04s)



[pick my master branch up reset it point](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m06s)



[it to the same commit so for example I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m09s)



[want mine to be perfectly in line with](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m11s)

[now going to pull from this state so my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m25s)



[local master is here my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m28s)



[my fork master branch is ahead by one so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m31s)



[when I pull it's going to bring me up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m35s)



[even to this so now these guys are in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m37s)



[and in sync so reset master mixed](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m40s)



[keeping working changes so this is this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m45s)



[is the one that I was trying to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m47s)



[demonstrate unfortunately so it reset](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m48s)



[back one commit but once again kept the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m53s)



[the working changes so similar to the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m56s)



[soft in functionality and in general you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h11m58s)



[probably want to do either the software](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m01s)



[the mix most of the time when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m05s)



[doing a reset unless you really are just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m06s)



[saying move this branch pointer around](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m07s)



[so sometimes that's useful it's worth](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m09s)



[knowing about it is also worth noting](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m12s)



[that when a lot of times when you get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m14s)



[into these states where you're moving](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m15s)



[branch point is around you're going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m16s)



[end up needing to force push up to your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m18s)



[repository because if get can't easily](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m20s)



[walk that link list and bring you up to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m24s)



[to date it's gonna say I can't do this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m26s)

[gonna pull that guy back up bring me in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m36s)



[sync there we go and get crack and did](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m39s)



[all of the wonderful things trying to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m46s)



[think what else I was going to do Oh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m48s)



[branching and merging oh there there's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m50s)



[the fun stuff okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h12m53s)

[just gonna hide the intelligent one and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m01s)



[we're not gonna work with it we're just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m02s)



[gonna deal with our github and some](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m04s)



[other one so we've got our master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m07s)



[here and we are going to take this guy](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m11s)



[and say I'm going to create a branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m14s)



[write a fix issue - even though there is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m15s)



[no issue - we're gonna pretend there's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m19s)



[an issue - - and we are going to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m21s)



[through and let's edit this file and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m25s)



[this take that guy out great and we'll](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m32s)



[leave that there](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m37s)



[so again just making a change for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m38s)



[demonstration of changes so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m41s)



[save it and saying remove unneeded](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m43s)



[sentence right commit change okay so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m49s)



[that pushes it up and then say we want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m53s)



[to go back and we want to fix another](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m55s)



[issue well we should typically when we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h13m57s)



[fix our issues we don't want all of our](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m00s)



[changes based on the same same set of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m02s)



[changes so if issue - and issue three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m05s)



[are unrelated they should be based on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m07s)



[the current master not based upon the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m09s)



[same commit so we're gonna go back here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m11s)



[create branch fix issue three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m13s)



[okay so we go we go back now once again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m19s)



[if we look and I'm gonna just pull open](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m23s)



[vs coat you'll notice I'm back here fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m26s)



[issue to remove this line but because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m30s)



[I'm now back on this commit this is the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m33s)



[current state of my file okay feel free](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m35s)



[to stop me if if I need to go back and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m39s)



[do this because it is easy to get lost](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m41s)



[in all of this branch history stuff okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m43s)



[and then we're just going to come in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m46s)



[here edit file and for issue three we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m47s)



[going to remove that one right save](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m51s)



[close and removing a show changes line](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h14m55s)



[okay so now I've got issue three and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m07s)



[issue two both over here and now we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m10s)



[going to go through and do one more one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m14s)



[more thing so I create a new branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m16s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m21s)



[let's no let's just let's just do a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m25s)



[merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m30s)



[okay so I'm going to switch back to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m30s)



[master and say okay what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m34s)



[I want to actually bring the changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m37s)



[from this fix issue to back into my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m38s)



[master branch right so I've got some](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m41s)



[changes they exist over here on this on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m44s)



[this branch here but I actually want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m46s)



[them back on master as well so what you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m48s)



[end up doing is you right-click on your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m51s)



[branch and say merge as soon as I find](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m53s)



[it merge fix issue two into master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h15m56s)



[verify the order of these branch names](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m00s)



[when you do it okay so where it's coming](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m02s)



[merge where it's coming from into target](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m05s)



[branch so the in get crackin and get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m08s)



[outside of a few weird tools you the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m12s)



[target branch on where the changes are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m15s)



[going into should be the branch that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m16s)



[you're currently on okay so this little](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m18s)



[check box indicates I'm currently on the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m21s)



[master branch I'm going to merge issue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m23s)



[two into this branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m25s)



[so bring it in and you'll note there](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m27s)



[were no conflicts so it was perfectly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m31s)



[happy to go through and merge this and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m33s)



[so and get cracking you'll notice you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m35s)



[get these little kind of filled in dot](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m36s)



[commits these are special commits and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m39s)



[get most of these commits the ones that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m41s)



[have the nice little pictures they only](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m44s)



[have a single parent so we can we can go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m48s)



[out the bottom of these commits and we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m50s)



[can go ah where did these changes come](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m52s)



[from merge commits are special in that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m54s)



[they have more than one parent commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m57s)



[okay so you'll know like if we look at](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h16m58s)



[this parent on most of these like this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m01s)



[one shows the parent of this commit is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m04s)



[this guy down here great but if we look](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m06s)



[at this merge commit it actually has two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m09s)



[parents because two things effectively](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m11s)



[have come together does that make sense](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m13s)



[this is how you effectively bring from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m17s)



[one branch into another if you need to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m21s)



[bring changes in this is how you do it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m23s)



[so in a lot of cases what people end up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m25s)



[doing is what's called feature branching](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m27s)



[and git so when they when they want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m29s)



[test something or add some amount of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m32s)



[work a lot of times the first step is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m34s)



[create a branch do the work that you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m36s)



[want on that branch and then merge it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m38s)



[back into your other branch okay and you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m40s)



[can do branches of branches of branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m43s)



[as deeply nested as you want to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m45s)



[that's effectively how it ends up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m47s)



[working and this whole branching](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m49s)



[strategy is what makes get completely](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m51s)



[awesome](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m53s)



[okay so now we say we want oh well I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m54s)



[want issue threes changes back on master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m56s)



[ok so right click merge feature 3 in and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h17m59s)



[you'll note git is intelligent enough to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m04s)



[figure this out because fix issue two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m06s)



[took care of this line down here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m09s)



[fix issue three deleted this line up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m14s)



[here and so because those are different](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m18s)



[sections of the same file gits is able](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m22s)



[to replay those deltas and end up with a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m25s)



[readme that is just this without the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m27s)



[extra lines effectively able to merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m31s)



[those guys in which is great and because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m34s)



[you've now got this link back you now](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m36s)



[have a very clear path of figuring out](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m38s)



[okay how did these changes come in and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m40s)



[when did they come in so a lot of times](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m41s)



[when the question comes of why does my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m44s)



[file look like this or how did I get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m46s)



[into this state it's all about just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m47s)



[following these lines backwards to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m50s)



[figure out where the heck that they came](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m51s)



[from or where they need to go okay I am](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m53s)



[going to undo this merge and reset my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h18m59s)



[master back just throw that commit away](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m02s)



[real quick okay so I'm I'm now back over](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m05s)



[on this on this state here right so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m08s)



[let's go back to fix issue three okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m10s)



[and back into here we're going to edit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m15s)



[this file and this change is awesome](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m19s)



[okay so we'll save](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m24s)



[stage changes and again don't take my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m29s)



[commit messages as a good example of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m35s)



[what you should type in these this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m37s)



[horrible okay so now fix issue three has](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m38s)



[a change on it that is going to conflict](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m43s)



[with fix issue two its editing the exact](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m45s)



[same line in the same file okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m47s)



[so if we were to go back to master and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m50s)



[say okay let's let's bring in huh what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m53s)



[would be a good commit message generally](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h19m57s)

[synopsis of the changes that were made](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m03s)



[that's probably the easiest way of of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m05s)



[declaring what a good commit message](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m07s)



[should be because ideally when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m10s)



[looking back through this history you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m12s)



[want to be able to scan this this list](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m14s)



[of messages to know what you expect to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m16s)



[find inside of this commit so it doesn't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m19s)



[need to be long and detailed but if it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m21s)



[but history messages like this are not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m25s)



[really good enough for me to look and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m29s)



[know what are the changes that I expect](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m30s)



[to find in here usually if you don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m32s)



[type in good commit messages the only](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m35s)



[one who suffers is you because the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m37s)



[value of them really comes when you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m40s)



[looking at your history to understand](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m41s)



[what what change is where a lot of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m43s)



[people also would say that you want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m46s)



[indicate the why that particular changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m48s)



[were done so because the what is usually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m51s)



[pretty easy to derive I can look at your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m54s)



[commit and I can tell you what was done](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m56s)



[but I can never look at your commit and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h20m58s)



[know why it was done so including the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m00s)



[why I made this change now the why could](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m02s)



[be I was fixing you know issue three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m05s)



[that's okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m07s)



[great that gives me some context into](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m09s)



[why those changes were made because the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m11s)



[why is something that you can never find](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m14s)



[just by looking at the code that's also](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m16s)



[the the the same rule applies to code](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m18s)



[comments so typically the argument is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m20s)



[you should not comment your code](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m24s)



[comments in your code usually indicate](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m27s)



[that your code is unreadable so in an](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m30s)



[ideal world you should be able to read](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m34s)



[your code and well-written code usually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m36s)



[reads kind of like a book now there's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m39s)



[there's lots of exceptions](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m41s)



[like high-performance code and whatnot](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m43s)



[where it just gets ugly and so sometimes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m45s)



[commenting exactly what is happening is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m48s)



[useful but in a lot of times the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m50s)



[what is happening is usually fairly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m52s)



[obvious from looking at the code and so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m54s)



[a comment that's in there that tells you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m56s)



[what is happening is it best meaningless](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h21m57s)



[and at worst misleading and so in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m00s)



[general it's better to the refactor your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m03s)



[code to make it read nicely rather than](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m06s)



[add a comment to it now where the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m07s)



[comments come in valuable or where the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m10s)



[comments gain their value is if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m12s)



[explain why some code is doing why it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m13s)



[doing of I had to make this change](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m16s)



[because of this bug or I had to make](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m18s)



[this change to account for this other](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m20s)



[case because the why is never fully](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m22s)



[captured inside of the code](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m26s)



[maybe you name things and it hints as to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m28s)



[why but it's never something that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m30s)



[actually in the the what of the code](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m32s)



[that it's doing so if that helps merging](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m34s)



[that's where I was me for half my degree](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m40s)



[because we are graded for putting in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m45s)



[comments I think that that is the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m47s)



[definition and I got to be careful when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m53s)



[I say this because I was spoiled when I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m57s)



[went through college I had really good](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h22m59s)



[professors and one in particular that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m02s)



[used to work for HP and he was very good](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m04s)



[about making sure that he was teaching](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m08s)



[us stuff that actually mattered in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m10s)



[industry rather than stuff that mattered](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m14s)



[in academia because those are two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m16s)



[different worlds very different worlds](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m17s)



[so if you're going for your like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m19s)



[doctorate or something or masters it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m21s)



[it's good to understand what academia](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m24s)



[wants but in industry it's it's the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m26s)



[fewer the the less comments you have to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m31s)



[write the better the code is that you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m33s)



[probably writing probably and yeah](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m35s)



[Javadoc yeah there there's also tools](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m38s)



[like go stock for c-sharp they go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m40s)



[through and try to automatically comment](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m43s)



[your code and there's some tools out](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m45s)



[there that that really try to force you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m47s)



[into commenting all of your your public](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m49s)



[methods which there is a good place for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m52s)



[commenting it the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m55s)



[the problem is the auto-generated](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m56s)



[comments that are basically derived from](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m57s)



[the what really don't add a lot of value](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h23m59s)



[it's it's not getting you anything if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m04s)



[there's no Xplode a comment on your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m07s)



[method and all it tells me is exactly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m10s)



[what the method name already told me](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m12s)



[what value is it and then worse you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m14s)



[change what the method is doing and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m17s)



[forget to update the comment now your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m19s)



[comments lying to me which is even worse](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m20s)



[so write good code include the Y in your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m22s)



[comments and yeah community college](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m27s)



[professors wanted Java Docs and also J](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m34s)



[unit tests at least at least they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m37s)



[actually made you write unit tests](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m39s)



[that's been one of our complaints with a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m41s)



[lot of graduates that we've seen is they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m43s)



[come out of college and you ask them](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m46s)



[about unit testing and you just get in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m47s)



[the deer-in-the-headlights tear it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m49s)



[like okay we need a little better than](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m50s)



[that okay Murr gene fix issue three into](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m53s)



[master after we've caused a conflict](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m57s)



[perfect so we're back on the master](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h24m59s)



[branch right click on fix issue three we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m02s)



[are going to merge into master this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m04s)



[usually where this is usually where it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m07s)



[causes people to lose code okay merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m11s)



[conflicts this happens a lot it happens](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m14s)



[a little less on like University](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m18s)



[assignments because a lot of times you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m20s)



[aren't collaborating with maybe another](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m23s)



[person or two at most and so the the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m25s)



[chance of conflicts is is pretty small](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m29s)



[but in get you can run into conflicts](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m32s)



[any number of ways whether you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m34s)



[working with another person whether](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m36s)



[you're just trying to bring merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m38s)



[somebody else's changes into your branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m40s)



[or heck even your your changes on one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m43s)



[branch into another one they do happen](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m46s)



[and so when a conflict happens and get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m47s)



[cracking you end up with something like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m51s)



[this and I started showing it I'll be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m52s)



[using github with my senior project team](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m58s)



[so this will apply yes and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h25m59s)



[I actually think that it's helpful if](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m02s)



[people haven't done get before and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m04s)



[they're starting on it to go through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m06s)



[do an exercise like this where they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m09s)



[intentionally cause conflicts and figure](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m10s)



[out how to resolve them I'd probably do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m12s)



[it with it with actual code so that it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m14s)



[a little more obvious like have two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m16s)



[people edit the same method and then](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m18s)



[merge them together that gives you a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m20s)



[pretty good idea of what you end up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m22s)



[going through this again I'm very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m24s)



[intentionally not doing code in this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m25s)



[case but if you've got people who aren't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m28s)



[familiar with it this is useful so we've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m30s)



[got we've got a conflict here so on the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m33s)



[master branch and then and this is worth](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m35s)



[it's always worth noting so you can see](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m37s)



[and get cracking how we've got these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m39s)



[kind of dotted lines and I'm gonna move](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m40s)



[this election off you've got two dotted](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m42s)



[lines here of it really wants the data](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m44s)



[lines and yeah unfortunately I would](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m49s)



[like to tell you gets better but in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m52s)



[industry merge conflicts caused you to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m53s)



[lose code all the time](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m55s)



[and we actually tell companies that are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h26m57s)



[switching to get from another source](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m00s)



[control solution to just assume that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m02s)



[there is going to be lost productivity](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m04s)



[and lost work as the team starts to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m06s)



[learning get because especially while](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m09s)



[people are learning it it is so easy to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m12s)



[mess up so so easy okay so get get](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m14s)



[cracking is showing that hey I want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m18s)



[do this merge complications but I've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m20s)



[a problem and this is the important](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m25s)



[thing before you start going through](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m27s)



[these conflicts pay attention to what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m28s)



[are the two branches that they're coming](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m31s)



[from master and fixed issue three these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m33s)



[are the two locations that were coming](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m35s)



[from so we're on master and we're trying](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m36s)



[to merge fix fix issue three wow I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m40s)



[really should have picked something that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m42s)



[can pronounce this late at night okay so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m44s)



[we look at the conflict and get cracking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m46s)



[goes through and shows us and says okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m48s)



[we've got one that's deleted it and one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m50s)



[that's saying this change is awesome and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m52s)



[so now we have to come up with the idea](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m54s)



[of what is the correct merge and this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m57s)



[and again because this is subjective it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h27m59s)



[can't figure it out and sometimes when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m01s)



[it automatically figures it out just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m03s)



[because two pieces or two lines don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m06s)



[directly match and it's able to bring in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m09s)



[both set of changes doesn't mean your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m11s)



[code compiles after emerge okay it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m12s)



[very easy for me to edit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m15s)



[code on in one area that breaks another](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m16s)



[area and gets perfectly happy because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m19s)



[it's just treating everything as text](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m21s)



[files it doesn't know anything about you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m22s)



[know source control structure or any of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m25s)



[that stuff it literally just knows file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m26s)



[line number column number do these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m28s)



[conflict nope great Mirjam but in this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m30s)



[case we've got a conflict so we have to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m32s)



[figure out what is the appropriate](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m34s)



[change and I sort of showed this a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m35s)



[little bit earlier with the rebase as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m36s)



[well again a case where the commit can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m38s)



[occur but it's important to note up at](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m40s)



[the top it'll show you the two branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m42s)



[in question so on this side we've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m44s)



[the current state of the the change on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m46s)



[the master branch and then over here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m49s)



[we've got the current state of the file](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m51s)



[on the fix issue branch and it's showing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m53s)



[you the change so on both of these up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m56s)



[here it's showing you the commit on each](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h28m59s)



[of these branches that was made to do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m02s)



[this and then down here it's questioning](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m04s)



[going I don't know what to do this was](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m07s)



[the original file and it this was the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m09s)



[original file on the master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m12s)



[before each of these what do you want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m14s)



[okay so it's like uh if we take what you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m17s)



[did on master you took this and deleted](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m20s)



[it but on fixed issue three you you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m24s)



[changed it from and this to and this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m28s)



[change is awesome so what do we want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m31s)



[do so we could pick one say that's what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m34s)



[I want we could pick the other we could](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m36s)



[pick both or we could get even worse and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m40s)



[say what we really want is neither of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m44s)



[these we just want this and by the way](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m48s)



[we want it to be not awesome and I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m50s)



[really hard doing my best to not do lego](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m54s)



[movie quotes right now okay regardless](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h29m57s)



[of whatever you decide ultimately what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m01s)



[needs to happen is this this result down](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m03s)



[here on the output needs to be whatever](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m05s)



[the appropriate change is okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m07s)



[so we're gonna be we're gonna be careful](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m12s)



[here and did not overdo this because](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m14s)



[this now looks what were looks like what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m17s)



[we want so we're gonna hit save and then](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m20s)



[we can look at our thanks for that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m25s)



[earworm you're welcome so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m29s)



[look down here and see okay now now on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m32s)



[my master branch this is the current](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m35s)



[state of it go ahead and commit and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m37s)



[merge okay so now we have a merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m39s)



[conflict in general when you're making](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m42s)



[these merge commits you want to avoid](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m44s)



[making extra changes of them so the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m48s)



[exact thing that I just did where you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m50s)



[edit the output window in general you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m52s)



[only want to do that if you're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m54s)



[effectively fixing something right the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h30m56s)



[the problem with making a lot of extra](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m00s)



[changes before doing this merge conflict](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m03s)



[is they're very easy to get lost the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m05s)



[expectation when you're looking at a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m07s)



[merge commit is it really should just be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m09s)



[the changes from the two branches coming](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m12s)



[together if there's extra stuff that you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m13s)



[need to change great we can go back and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m16s)



[deal with that later but in reality it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m17s)



[really is just bringing two things](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m20s)



[together](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m22s)



[if you sneak in a bunch of extra changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m23s)



[there it's kind of a sneaky underhanded](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m25s)



[way of doing it and then it gets really](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m26s)



[confusing because you look at this merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m28s)



[conflict and go hang on how did how did](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m29s)



[we get how did we get here from these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m32s)



[two places and the answer is well an](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m35s)



[extra change came as part of this commit](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m37s)



[oh darn you now you've got one stuck in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m39s)



[my ear too it doesn't help that my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m44s)



[daughter was listening to it earlier](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m50s)



[tonight too](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m51s)



[oh boy okay so let's let's look I think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m55s)



[that's close to everything I was let's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h31m59s)



[see rebase merge I think that really](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m01s)



[covers a lot of what what is really](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m06s)



[important to know especially in terms of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m10s)



[if anybody wants to go through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m12s)



[contribute to HACC Tober fest I think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m16s)



[that that that really gets a good thing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m20s)



[or a good starting place again it's it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m22s)



[really just about making sure that you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m26s)



[have your branches in the right state](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m27s)



[and then pushing them up so once again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m29s)



[you can see that my local master branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m32s)



[it shows his five commits that are going](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m35s)



[to get sent up so one two three four](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m37s)



[five so each of these little dots count](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m42s)



[even though the line looks like there](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m45s)



[may only be two because each of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m46s)



[merge commits comes in and it brings in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m48s)



[you know extra ones from these side](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m51s)



[lines that are coming through so we can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m53s)



[push it let's push oh you know this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h32m58s)



[actually probably something worth noting](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m02s)



[about so so there are a bunch of extra](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m04s)



[git commands that I've not actually](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m07s)



[covered but we're gonna cover we're](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m10s)



[gonna cover two more that I think are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m12s)



[somewhat helpful I'm basically covering](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m14s)



[things in the order that I use them in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m16s)



[my day to day job because that's roughly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m19s)



[what I think is valuable so let's go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m22s)



[through and make it in working directory](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m26s)



[uh so we're gonna we're gonna clean](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m30s)



[these guys up so we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m35s)



[save file yes I thought I hit the save](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m37s)



[file button okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m42s)



[so I've got a save change here so I've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m44s)



[got I've got some work in progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m46s)



[changes and you this sort of showed up a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m47s)



[little bit earlier but say you're in the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m51s)



[middle of of some changes you're working](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m54s)



[along and then you realize oh shoot that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m56s)



[pull request somebody just made a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h33m59s)



[comment back on my fix issue three](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m00s)



[branch I need to go and make a change](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m03s)



[here but say it's like I'm not really in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m05s)



[a state where I want to commit it but I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m09s)



[just kind of want to hold these changes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m11s)



[that's what these little buttons here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m12s)



[for our stash and pop so stash I'll just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m14s)



[click it so you'll know it takes all of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m17s)



[my my current changes and just kind of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m20s)



[throws it in a little bucket basically](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m22s)



[preserve my state of all of the deltas](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m24s)



[that I have throw them off I need to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m27s)



[switch over to de fix issue three and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m29s)



[now you know I'm good to go I can start](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m31s)



[editing things from the state you know](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m33s)



[maybe make changes to this branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m35s)



[whatever right and then there is when I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m36s)



[come back to master I can go ah okay](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m40s)



[let's go ahead and pop my stash right](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m43s)



[and poof pulls it off but let's go back](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m45s)



[because that's that's a very simplistic](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m50s)



[way of using stack or stash and pop you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m53s)



[can actually do things that are a little](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m57s)



[more fun with them so for example I can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h34m59s)



[I can stash these changes here switch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m02s)



[branches and then pop them back off so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m05s)



[you can sort of take your work in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m10s)



[progress changes and then move them](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m12s)



[around so use case where something like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m15s)



[that might be helpful is you start](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m17s)



[working in on one branch and you realize](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m19s)



[halfway through your changes that oh](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m21s)



[shoot I I started this I'm not based on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m25s)



[the right commit what do I do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m28s)



[well one simple OSH option is stash and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m31s)



[then pop now it's worth noting that when](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m34s)



[you pop this could cause a conflict that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m35s)



[you have to resolve so same rules as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m40s)



[before if there's you know two things](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m42s)



[that have edited the same](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m45s)



[it doesn't know how to reapply those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m46s)



[Delta's you're going to get a conflict](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m47s)



[and it's now up to you to address it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m49s)



[okay but it is an easy way of going back](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m51s)



[and forth between those let's do one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h35m54s)



[more let's do one more command um it's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m00s)



[only ten-thirty okay so I'm on fix issue](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m04s)



[3 and let's say that while I'm on this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m07s)



[branch so I'm gonna hide master real](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m12s)



[quick and just just turn you these guys](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m14s)



[off okay so I've turned off my remote](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m17s)



[branches so this little eyeball on the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m20s)



[side I find to be very helpful you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m22s)



[turn things on and off to determine](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m24s)



[whether they show up in your central](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m26s)



[view or not](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m27s)



[so doesn't mean things are gone it just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m28s)



[means they don't show up in the in the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m30s)



[view which this can get very cluttered](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m31s)



[so turning things on and off is very](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m34s)



[helpful so I've hidden my remotes and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m35s)



[I've hidden my master I still do have a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m38s)



[master branch but for now I'm only](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m39s)



[interested in these branches so I'm on](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m41s)



[fix issue 3 and there's this change over](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m43s)



[on fix issue 2 and I go I really want](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m46s)



[that change over on this branch too but](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m50s)



[it's already been committed so I can't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m53s)



[really do the the stache pop like you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m54s)



[were saying unknown sailor for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m57s)



[effectively copying between branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h36m59s)



[because the the stashin and the popping](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m01s)



[really only works for work-in-progress](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m03s)



[changes but there is effectively another](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m06s)



[command to let you do it so you can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m09s)



[always right-click and cherry-pick a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m11s)



[commit okay so what this does is it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m13s)



[takes the deltas of the commits that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m17s)



[you've selected and replays just those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m19s)



[Delta's from just this commit so it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m24s)



[doesn't consider the history tree at all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m25s)



[okay it just looks at what's inside of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m27s)



[that one commit and says okay I need the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m30s)



[deltas from just these commits and I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m32s)



[want to replay them over here so we can](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m35s)



[go cherry-pick commit and then do we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m37s)



[want to immediately commit them so do we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m40s)



[want to make a new commit with these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m42s)



[changes or do we want to have them just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m43s)



[get applied as part of our work in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m45s)



[progress so we're gonna say no so that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m46s)



[they apply as our work in progress and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m49s)



[then poof we have a merge conflict we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m51s)



[have to deal with it right so we are](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m53s)



[going to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m55s)



[take these guys unless just uh no it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h37m57s)



[won't let me it won't let me mark has](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m01s)



[resolved great and I'm gonna I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m05s)



[throw these guys away and on stage](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m07s)



[discard discard get rid of all my stuff](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m11s)



[okay right so let's go over here so say](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m14s)



[I'm on fix issue two and I want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m18s)



[actually bring these two issues across](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m21s)



[right now I've got a couple choices I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m25s)



[could I could take fix issue three and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m29s)



[say merge into my branch that would be](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m31s)



[one way of getting them across I could](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m34s)



[cherry-pick these guys one at a time](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m36s)



[across but that's that's a little](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m38s)



[obnoxious or what I could do is I could](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m41s)



[take these two commits and squash them](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m45s)



[into a single commit and then be able to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m47s)



[cherry make it across right so let's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m48s)



[let's do that so I am going to create a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m51s)



[new branch called Wow](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h38m54s)



[you know it's late when my spelling](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m02s)



[terior eats to that more about do that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m04s)



[is the solution okay so you'll note I've](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m09s)



[got a squash me branch that's sitting up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m12s)



[here now if you have commits that are in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m14s)



[a straight line right so basically they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m17s)



[they've got parents that that go nice](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m19s)



[and linearly and you don't skip any in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m22s)



[the middle what you can do is control or](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m24s)



[shift-click to get multiple commits](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m27s)



[selected and then you can right-click](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m29s)



[and say where is squash squash these two](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m32s)



[commits together so what it ends up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m35s)



[doing make it a little bigger there we](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m38s)



[go that was a weird redraw problem is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m42s)



[it's taken both of these commits and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m44s)



[taken those deltas and squash them into](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m46s)



[a single commit that has the combined](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m49s)



[set of Delta's right so when I commented](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m51s)



[earlier about that squash and merge up](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m55s)



[above that that's effectively what](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h39m58s)



[github gives you the option of doing is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m01s)



[when you take in somebody's pull request](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m02s)



[you can either create a merge commit or](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m04s)



[you can squash all of their changes into](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m06s)



[a single commit and just basically](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m08s)



[cherry-pick that guy across which is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m10s)



[usually my preferred way of doing it but](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m13s)



[again every repo does things their own](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m15s)



[way so we've now got a this squash me](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m17s)



[branch and the only reason I made the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m21s)



[the squash me branch is I didn't want to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m22s)



[affect the the fix issue three so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m25s)



[whenever you're worried about breaking](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m28s)



[something or doing something wrong the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m30s)



[easiest thing to do is just make a new](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m32s)



[branch because now you can start playing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m34s)



[with stuff and making changes without](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m37s)



[worrying about messing up the original](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m38s)



[branch over here](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m41s)



[so if I don't do anything with this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m42s)



[guy's branch pointer and I'm just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m44s)



[playing in my other branch as far as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m46s)



[gets concerned these are separate areas](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m48s)



[I don't need to worry about it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m49s)



[okay so now I've got this guy here and I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m51s)



[could either merge this in or now on fix](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m54s)



[issue two I could just cherry-pick this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h40m58s)



[one commit back across right so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m00s)



[squashing commits can be very helpful so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m03s)



[the reason people usually like squashing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m05s)



[commits especially when taking in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m08s)



[somebody's pull request is there's a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m10s)



[idea that if I go back through the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m12s)



[history of my master brain](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m15s)



[it's really nice if I can effectively](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m16s)



[reset my master pointer to any commit in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m19s)



[its tree and be able to effectively](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m22s)



[build and run the problem is is when you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m25s)



[take in pull requests if you do merge](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m28s)



[commits you don't necessarily know that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m30s)



[every commit from that person's branch](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m33s)



[that you merged in is in a good runnable](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m35s)



[state right so maybe the end result is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m37s)



[when they did the pull request but maybe](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m40s)



[they were committing every 20 minutes](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m42s)



[while they were developing it nice](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m44s)



[incrementally like you should and they](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m46s)



[their branch has you know 25 commits and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m49s)



[you merge it in that means you've got 25](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m52s)



[commits in your history tree that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m54s)



[somebody could theoretically reset to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m56s)



[and they may be in a broken state if you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h41m58s)



[know they pick commit 14 right so a lot](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m00s)



[of times when a pull request is merged](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m03s)



[in the idea is you'll squash it down to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m05s)



[a single commit and bring that in](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m07s)



[because you know the end result of that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m08s)



[branch is a good state and so then you](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m10s)



[end up with a master branch that looks](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m14s)



[very incremental where every single](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m16s)



[commit is just an isolated one so](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m18s)



[practical example one of the repos that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m21s)



[I manage out online you can see the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m25s)



[master branch is very much individual](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m27s)



[commits all the way down and without](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m31s)



[diving too deep into them each of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m33s)



[are effectively individual pull requests](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m36s)



[going back something worthwhile knowing](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m38s)



[on get crackin and I'm gonna make my](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m41s)



[window big and try to just be conscious](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m44s)



[of what's on the bottom corner here this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m46s)



[little colored bar you can move it back](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m48s)



[and forth to expand and collapse your](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m50s)



[history tree so if you drag it all the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m53s)



[way to the left you get just a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m54s)



[chronological list of your commits and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m56s)



[you effectively lose seeing the lines](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h42m58s)



[between your commits for the history I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m02s)



[don't like that as much I usually like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m04s)



[it bigger like this but dragging it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m05s)



[across means now you see less of the](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m07s)



[commit message so it's kind of which do](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m09s)



[you want to see I was kinda hoping to go](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m10s)



[back a little further to see something](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m13s)



[in the history where it deviated around](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m15s)



[but apparently I've squashed stuff way](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m17s)



[too long and everything is just a one](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m19s)



[solid pipeline](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m22s)



[which isn't bad you can see a couple](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m24s)



[merge commits going through and a lot of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m26s)



[these ones here are coming from me just](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m30s)



[on a different account and pulling all](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m35s)



[these through I was hoping to show more](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m38s)



[here let's turn on more branches this is](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m40s)



[probably part of the problem more](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m42s)



[branches more branches more branches](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m43s)



[take me back to this one so this will](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m45s)



[probably start showing a little bit more](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m49s)



[of the extra branches coming through and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m50s)



[more changes some of these some of these](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m53s)



[ones here are a little bit older okay I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h43m56s)



[think that is everything on my agenda](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m00s)



[let me just double check my list I think](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m03s)



[I covered it all I think I covered it](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m06s)



[all so that is that is everything I was](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m09s)



[going to cover tonight unless people](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m13s)



[have questions or there's more things](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m15s)



[that you want to see I am I'm happy to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m16s)



[stick around and answer questions and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m21s)



[see how things go but I think at this](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m25s)



[point it's probably a little late to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m27s)



[dive into anything else and I also don't](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m29s)



[think my head is in a great state for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m33s)



[for trying to fix code on another](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m34s)



[project well you're going it's getting](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m36s)



[late and I don't have a mountain dew to](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m41s)



[feel myself yes so I do i do stream](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m42s)



[every Monday night I usually aim for](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m46s)



[9:00 to 11:00 Pacific time everything](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m49s)



[gets posted on my youtube afterwards as](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m53s)



[well so you can find that there and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h44m57s)



[those](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m03s)



[yeah exactly](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m06s)



[so because I am very conscious that that](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m09s)



[9:00 to 11:00 Pacific time is like](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m12s)



[sleeping time for the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m15s)



[the globe because I think like European](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m17s)



[time that's people getting up and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m21s)



[heading off to work and yeah it's it's a](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m24s)



[really bad time for everybody but again](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m26s)



[it's it's what I'm available so that's](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m28s)



[when I stream because otherwise I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m30s)



[wouldn't so sometimes it's just me](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m32s)



[talking to myself for a little bit but I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m35s)



[know a lot of people will go back and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m37s)



[playback the YouTube videos too so and](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m38s)



[yeah if you have any questions again I](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m43s)



[usually when I come onto stream I've got](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m45s)



[some idea of an agenda of what I'm](https://youtu.be/4UvCz4BQnW0?t=01h45m47s)
