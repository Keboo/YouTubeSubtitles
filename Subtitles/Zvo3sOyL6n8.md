[you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m09s)



[okay test test test there we go okay I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m22s)



[apologize if this stream quality may not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m26s)



[be up to snuff as my usual ones I am](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m30s)



[traveling and in a hotel right now so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m32s)



[we're going to see how well this works](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m35s)



[and how long it keeps going yeah I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m36s)



[remember where I left off last time so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m43s)



[my intent tonight there's a couple bugs](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m44s)



[for material design example I wanted to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m47s)



[take a look at specifically there is an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m50s)



[issue with nougat dependencies so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m51s)



[previously it was failing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m54s)



[I fixed the fail but the version](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m56s)



[dependencies appeared to still be broken](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h01m58s)



[so we are going to take a crack at that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m00s)



[to begin with just to sort of see what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m03s)



[is going on and I'm going to apologize](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m06s)



[in advance I because I'm traveling I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m10s)



[don't have my normal multi-monitor so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m13s)



[it's going to be it's going to be an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m15s)



[interesting ride so trying to figure out](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m17s)



[how to get everything set up let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m21s)



[switch over here so here that goes away](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m23s)



[that goes away](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m28s)



[okay so let's jump over here to github](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m31s)



[and we will take a crack at how this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m36s)



[going](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m39s)



[apologize if I bounce back and forth to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m40s)



[stream labs because I just need to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m42s)



[confirm that things are actually set up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m44s)



[the way that I think that they are okay](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m46s)



[so first and foremost we've got an icon](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m49s)



[update let's just check it real quick](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m52s)



[it's probably something simple for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m55s)



[people who watch last stream we fix the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h02m59s)



[update so that now we can actually take](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m01s)



[a look at the diffs that we're inside of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m03s)



[this file previously it was one PC](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m06s)



[really long line so it looks like just a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m08s)



[couple icon additions like on additions](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m11s)



[let's go down to the end and just take a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m14s)



[look at the enum changes so addition](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m16s)



[addition addition addition addition](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m19s)



[addition so not really concerned with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m21s)



[these deletions because they are still](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m24s)



[in place so it does look like some of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m26s)



[the path data may be different so there](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m29s)



[are likely visual changes on those icons](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m31s)



[for those who have watched before I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m35s)



[think what I've mentioned is that right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m37s)



[now I'm not considering visual changes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m39s)



[to the pack icons a breaking change even](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m42s)



[though technically it is a visual](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m46s)



[breaking change so just be aware that if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m48s)



[you're updating that your your icon](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m51s)



[there's a chance they will look](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m53s)



[different](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m54s)



[unfortunately I'm not really interested](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m55s)



[in preserving old versions of the icons](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h03m57s)



[just because that becomes a miserable](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m00s)



[nightmare to go through and deal with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m04s)



[okay so step one we're going to just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m06s)



[spin this guy up and create a new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m08s)



[project we're just going to see WPF sure](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m11s)



[sounds good : dev I think I have 10 let](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m15s)



[me just make sure that I actually have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m24s)



[that CD it's going dead okay they're 10](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m25s)



[now great what's in here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m37s)



[WPF app 1 and W PFF - perfect we will do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m41s)



[WPF f3 that sounds like a wonderful name](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m45s)



[for an application so really what I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m48s)



[looking to do is really just pin down](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m50s)



[how the heck to properly setup these new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m53s)



[gate dependencies so show you what I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m55s)



[mean here in just a moment so first](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h04m58s)



[first and foremost we are going to go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m03s)



[out and just grab and you get packages](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m06s)



[that we need so browse material design](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m07s)



[as you can see I download these a couple](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m13s)



[times and now this is the important](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m16s)



[thing to be aware of for anybody playing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m20s)



[with nougat and our pre-releases is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m21s)



[unfortunately the build numbers rolled](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m24s)



[over from three digits to four digits](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m28s)



[and so because it doesn't or because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m30s)



[it's doing string comparisons on these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m33s)



[guys 981 is later then 1000 etcetera](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m36s)



[right so this is this is sort of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m44s)



[fundamental problem](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m47s)



[and that these don't work right with the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m48s)



[way that it does latest version so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m54s)



[latest according to doing it is not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m56s)



[actually the latest there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h05m59s)



[ways to go about fixing this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m02s)



[unfortunately because these things have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m04s)



[been pushed out already the simplest fix](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m06s)



[is to simply just push out the the next](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m08s)



[release and then the problem goes away](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m13s)



[so so unfortunately this guy's going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m15s)



[show us an update until we get around to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m18s)



[addressing it so the key thing here is I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m20s)



[think that worked didn't it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m23s)



[so let's jump back over here see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m26s)



[material design maps it's just let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m30s)



[just make sure it actually works right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m34s)



[because I don't want to I don't want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m35s)



[think too hard and tell people that it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m39s)



[fixed when it actually isn't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m41s)



[so let's actually spin some samaa app](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m42s)



[stuff and make sure that everything](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m47s)



[looks correct so let's see add the XML](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m49s)



[namespace and let's see my ABS material](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m53s)



[design we don't need draggable x' we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h06m58s)



[don't need show me the sample so all of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m02s)



[these go away this should be all that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m05s)



[required great fine ok so now let's do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m07s)



[something like what's in the demo app](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m13s)



[perhaps so the MA apps screen I think we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m14s)



[have a right even on the main window I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m18s)



[think we have just a flyout control](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m21s)



[don't we let me make that a little](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m22s)



[bigger just to make sure that that is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m25s)



[actually visible so well here's the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m28s)



[simple case right you just switch this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m34s)



[over to a Metro window so let's do that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m35s)



[right so rather than window this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m38s)



[going to become Metro window control](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m41s)



[period as I call it the Autocode button](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m45s)



[into victory sits like was there because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m48s)



[there now we should have a mops window](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m52s)



[let's change the code-behind because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m55s)



[that's going to complain about it the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h07m58s)



[easiest thing to do is just drop the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m00s)



[the base class offer this partial](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m02s)



[declaration and let the sam'l partial](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m05s)



[that gets generated control the base](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m06s)



[class that way it gets to decide because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m08s)



[our code behind really doesn't need to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m10s)



[be smart it just needs to call](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m12s)



[initialize component](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m14s)



[okay so let's jump back over here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m16s)



[there's a bunch of this stuff](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m20s)



[just do all of the theming stuff boom](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m25s)



[right and then to do something like that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m29s)



[something like that what have we set for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m36s)



[our color themes deep purple and light](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m38s)



[blue great sounds like a winner and then](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m40s)



[just go down here and scrub the MA apps](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m45s)



[page really quick because this is what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m50s)



[ultimately has a bunch of the my apps](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m52s)



[controls numeric up-down isn't that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m54s)



[interesting isn't there now we had a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h08m57s)



[like a checkboxes types of stuff maybe](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m00s)



[I'm crazy this is not like a checked](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m05s)



[content so text boxes it's a dialogue](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m08s)



[stuff not really what I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m12s)



[cuz my apps has more control than this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m16s)



[number wondering and we could do like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m19s)



[the range slider that toggle switch](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m22s)



[that's what I'm looking for right there](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m25s)



[we're just going to dump a toggle switch](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m27s)



[on our thing that's your horizontal](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m29s)



[alignment Center see Oracle 1 Center](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m31s)



[poof-poof](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m38s)



[and let's see if it works because it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m39s)



[would be really convenient to confirm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m42s)



[that this actually works and loads in](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m46s)



[all the proper versions of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m48s)



[assemblies looks like success okay so it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m50s)



[is fixed in the latest version which is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m54s)



[what we were going for okay perfect so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h09m58s)



[we don't need to spend a lot of time on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m00s)



[that I am going to just quickly jump](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m02s)



[into jitter and in an effort to not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m05s)



[expose all of my chats just give me one](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m10s)



[second I'm just going to type a quick](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m13s)



[mess](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m14s)



[for those people watching the chat room](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m15s)



[to make sure that they know see it looks](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m18s)



[like the issue is fix if you reference](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m24s)



[version do to configure what version did](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m30s)



[we reference Oh dot one CI because of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m34s)



[how you get determines the latest right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m47s)



[uh package version it does not register](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h10m54s)



[as latest you will need to scroll](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m03s)



[through the versions boom problem solved](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m09s)



[okay let's jump back here fix my screen](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m18s)



[to do there we go ok so let's take a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m24s)



[look at this so this was a scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m29s)



[pull request again I do tend to favor](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m31s)



[doing pull request before issues just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m34s)



[because I feel like people who put in](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m38s)



[the effort of submitting a pull request](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m40s)



[probably are worth looking at first see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m43s)



[what is this show separators property](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m48s)



[changed it always worries me having](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m50s)



[attached properties that have behavior](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h11m59s)



[associated with this let me turn that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h12m01s)



[off real quick so focus assist pls off](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h12m04s)



[okay so it's checking for this and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h12m10s)



[registering it up and on scroll changed](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h12m14s)

[scheduled to go out the door I'm curious](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h15m46s)



[to look at things still remaining in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h15m49s)



[milestone now alright](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h15m53s)

[take a look at this actually let's pull](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m31s)



[in the latest changes so we're going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m33s)



[pull the latest master switch back and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m35s)



[no longer need this branch go away and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m40s)



[I've got a bunch of remotes I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m45s)



[really need just clean up all these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m48s)



[remotes and perfect okay so bouncing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m51s)



[back let's fire this up and see how many](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h16m57s)



[of these bugs we can squash really quick](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m01s)



[because I would like to go through and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m03s)



[get this release out in the near future](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m06s)



[okay so let's go back to our directions](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m14s)



[because this was this was written up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m18s)



[well so open the demo app check let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m20s)



[just do a little docking action here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m24s)



[go to the field section still yeah the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m29s)



[fact that that doesn't show that cursor](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m33s)



[bothers me I'm gonna have to look at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m35s)



[what that's doing because I sort of it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m37s)



[sort of thought that that was similar to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m39s)



[this right but something is causing it I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m41s)



[suspect to be pushed too far over anyway](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m47s)



[I digress so go to the field section](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m51s)



[move the windows so that the at least](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m54s)



[eight characters in the helper text or](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m56s)



[the password control aligns with the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h17m59s)



[normal height window the taskbar so this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m00s)



[guy here so this is being pushed down to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m06s)



[like this alright so something about](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m09s)



[like this and then open the fruit combo](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m11s)



[box](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m16s)



[this is where I wonder about things](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m22s)



[because I don't doubt that there's a bug](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m24s)



[here right because I suspect I already](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m26s)



[know sort of what the problem is move](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m30s)



[you up a little more a little more a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m37s)



[little more there's a yeah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m43s)



[yeah there's an issue with padding again](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m54s)



[I suspect](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h18m59s)



[yeah because you'll know this thing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m02s)



[technically add space to expand down but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m04s)



[it chose not to it went up and I believe](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m06s)



[the issue is the padding that defaults](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m09s)



[on the pop up control let's just confirm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m11s)



[this really quick snoop because the new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m16s)



[screenshot to you should be seeing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m23s)



[something roughly like screenshot to the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m27s)



[pop of this position incorrectly and the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m31s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m45s)



[so this is interesting because this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m47s)



[showing that the pop up is actually](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m49s)



[positioned up here right so one of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m51s)



[fundamental problems of this we might](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m55s)



[just need to bite it right or bite this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h19m59s)



[off is that there there's this position](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m05s)



[stuff that happens with this pop-up box](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m08s)



[and it all boils down to making to doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m12s)



[the editable combo box right because on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m15s)



[the editable combo box you're expected](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m17s)



[to be able to type right here and when](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m19s)



[you can type right there in order to do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m22s)



[that the way this pop-up is being done](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m24s)



[is its generating effectively a hole](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m27s)



[right in the middle of it to show all](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m29s)



[the way through to the underlying text](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m31s)



[field which is fine except for that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m33s)



[really not what we want right because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m36s)



[unfortunately what this has repeatedly](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m40s)



[proven is that that hole position](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m44s)



[doesn't align well and it gets even](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m48s)



[worse when you start to do pixel offsets](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m50s)



[because it's really easy to get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m53s)



[something that's half a pixel on or off](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m55s)



[and you'll see bugs all over the place](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m56s)



[very similar to this screenshot here I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h20m58s)



[think I'm going to punt on this one at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m02s)



[least for tonight only because I know](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m04s)



[the amount of effort that's going to go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m06s)



[into this so on-screen keyboard and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m08s)



[dialogues did - did this one here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m12s)



[yeah this is another one that I have a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m28s)



[hunch of what's going on and I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m31s)



[know the correct fix combobox can't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m33s)



[contain images what's going on here to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m36s)



[do by adding a row definition in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m42s)



[height of auto 6a 115 to the three](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h21m47s)



[properly so this looks like it might](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m02s)



[just be a bug with the combo boxes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m04s)



[template so seems like the problem is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m06s)



[probably around this height right of if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m12s)



[you want to put in a combo box item and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m15s)



[I don't know if it's necessarily an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m18s)



[image I'd be willing to bet it's just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m19s)



[just an easy case to say an item with a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m21s)



[really tall height let's test it let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m24s)



[test it let's first turn off the zamel](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m29s)



[designer because it is annoying me and I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m34s)



[don't want to look at it these animal](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m36s)



[designer turn off great what does that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m40s)



[wait really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m45s)

[visual studios like I could have sworn](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m50s)



[it required a reboot](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m52s)



[so reboot that sucker real quick and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m53s)



[then pop it back open and for reference](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h22m58s)



[I'm probably not going to necessarily go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m07s)



[my whole time tonight we'll see how I go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m09s)

[we'll go back into our fields and I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m31s)



[think we're just going to test this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m33s)



[really quick because I think if we you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m34s)



[know what let's do this this has](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m38s)



[bothered me for a while but this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m40s)



[called text fields and the output is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m42s)



[called fields just it irks me so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h23m45s)

[fields of your model okay I don't know](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h24m02s)



[why we have this unloaded event handler](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h24m05s)



[but it's loaded event handler why are we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h24m13s)

[issue number fill the side 12:03 1203](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m16s)



[boom okay we're just going to fix naming](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m21s)



[of fields demo app okay well just put](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m29s)



[that as a isolated unit change and then](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m36s)



[carry on so let's make sure it runs and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m39s)



[then we're going to go change up sivak](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m43s)



[my solution explorer please okay](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m46s)



[change up the combo box so in this case](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m50s)



[rather than Android let's just take like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m54s)



[a pack icon and we will make it huge](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h26m56s)



[ripe Android width I don't know 100](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m01s)



[height 100 so regardless significantly](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m07s)



[larger than the default](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m12s)



[Oh Mountain Dew how I love me okay let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m17s)



[come in here back down to our fields and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m23s)



[then we were doing OSs](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m28s)



[that says Android what iOS Linux Windows](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m39s)



[just make absolutely certain you update](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m47s)



[incorrectly No so let's just do a full](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h27m55s)



[rebuild real quick because something](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m04s)



[something about that is not right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m07s)



[oh I'm looking at the wrong combo box](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m09s)



[that's why I yep this one down here is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m14s)



[the one that has the color mode inverted](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m21s)



[so probably should come up with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m24s)



[different values so that these things](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m29s)



[don't look alike the goal is for people](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m31s)



[to be able to actually look at this code](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m33s)



[and read it and if I can't even get it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m35s)



[right how can I expect somebody else to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m37s)



[so this one here there we go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m41s)



[that appears to work right oh that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m47s)



[appears to not work](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h28m55s)



[trying to decide if that's so from the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m06s)



[site this is just a an issue with the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m09s)



[theming or if it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m13s)



[okay so I assume that's the issue the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m24s)



[image is shown in the drop down but not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m28s)



[when the item is selected so this guy](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m30s)



[here grid rapper grid row definitions](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m33s)



[with a height of ATO so let's go take a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m37s)



[look at that because this might just fix](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m39s)



[our problem really quick - love it when](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m42s)



[people tell me exactly where I messed up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m45s)



[hey got a question about images does iOS](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m49s)



[and Android support SVG or do you know](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m53s)



[so Harrison the I'm going to assume that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h29m55s)



[you're doing the zamarons because if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m00s)



[this is native I don't have a lot of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m03s)



[knowledge in that area but I do do a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m05s)



[bunch of xamarin work there's not on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m06s)



[that let me be careful about this if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m09s)



[you're doing xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m12s)



[I believe the I don't remember whether](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m14s)



[it's a feature that's coming or a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m17s)



[feature that they implemented but there](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m19s)



[was talk of actually bringing a native](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m21s)



[SVG support and I probably have to go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m22s)



[and look that up but regardless there's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m26s)



[a library called skia sharp and they're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m29s)



[specifically a dependent nougat package](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m32s)



[it's like SPEA chef SVG and that does](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m35s)



[have SVG support so I've used that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m38s)



[before in xamarin apps so xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m40s)



[yeah so depending on what version of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m45s)



[forms are on you might have built-in](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m47s)



[support for it I know there was talk](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m49s)



[about adding it and I don't recall if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m50s)



[that was something that was coming or](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m52s)



[has already been implemented but either](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m54s)



[way skia sharp SVG does have support for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h30m57s)



[it and you can pull it in that way](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m00s)



[I've built a couple of xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m01s)



[apps using it there's a skier sharp has](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m04s)



[a forms control where you can put a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m08s)



[canvas in and then use the SPG's inside](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m09s)



[of there so if you run into problems let](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m12s)



[me know I can probably go and find some](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m15s)



[examples where it's been done I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m17s)



[actually now that I say that did does it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m21s)



[let me look real quick I believe I have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m27s)



[an example using the skier sharp SVG's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m29s)



[in here it's WPF but it at least will](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m33s)



[show you this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m37s)



[is sharp AP is yeah so and this is a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m38s)



[little dated let me drop this into chat](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m41s)



[so there's an example there and again](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m47s)



[it's using the so just inside of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m50s)



[main window](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m52s)



[sam'l stuff you can see how it's using](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m54s)



[the the skia sharp AP is and I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m56s)



[most of this is still pretty much the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h31m58s)



[same but if you're inside of salmon](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m00s)



[forms that this this API is very similar](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m03s)



[the only thing that really changes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m06s)



[inside of forms and don't quote me on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m07s)



[this because I'm doing this from memory](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m11s)



[because I think there's us I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m12s)



[remember if it's s K element or like SK](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m14s)



[canvas there's something slightly](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m16s)



[different if I remember right about how](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m18s)



[you position them but you can get nice](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m21s)



[SVG support doing that thank you for the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m24s)



[question by the way it's always nice](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m26s)



[knowing that I'm not just here talking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m28s)



[to myself I know I do this mostly for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m29s)



[fun so talking to myself sometimes can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m34s)



[be fun Oh see combobox](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m37s)



[that's what we were doing that's what we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m41s)



[were doing tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu so this guy](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m43s)



[down here see not the visual state](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m49s)



[manager what did they add the row to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m52s)



[so they to the grid rapper so this guy](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m55s)



[here oh yeah that'll do it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h32m59s)



[I completely agree so I think I'm going](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m05s)



[to put it below the visual statement](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m11s)



[just because I like to try and keep the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m13s)



[still state manager sort of off by it so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m16s)



[our definitions height:auto and rebuild](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m19s)



[relaunch and let's see if it works](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m25s)



[doot-doot-doot so let's see here so it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m39s)



[gonna hear click huzzah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m44s)



[being slightly cut off by the background](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m47s)



[here but this combo box has a whole](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m51s)



[bunch of stuff so this is somewhat](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m52s)



[expected behavior cool well given that I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h33m54s)



[didn't have to think too hard on that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m02s)



[I'm gonna ship it so what's the change](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m04s)



[here so that change I do not want so get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m06s)



[rid of that edge all changes making sure](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m10s)



[I selected item is respected oh can I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m17s)



[change and we'll push that up and yeah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m25s)



[that remote please and I got too many](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m30s)



[branches going I got way too many](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m35s)



[branches gone delete delete delete](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m38s)



[delete well okay so we'll go and pull](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m45s)



[request this guy see here so it was -](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h34m50s)



[yeah these are the selected item guys so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m00s)



[compare and pull request and we are](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m04s)



[fixed 12:03 1203 also cleaned up the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m06s)

[that in the milestone compare and pull](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m32s)



[request let the unit test do their thing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m34s)



[and we'll come back to the next one so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m39s)



[remote desktop closing down that's right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m41s)



[this was another one that was very well](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m44s)



[written up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m46s)



[and I suspect the issue here is with the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m48s)



[the window management in remote desktop](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m51s)



[you don't get all like the same](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m54s)



[animation stuff usually the way people](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m55s)



[will describe it occasionally inside of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h35m59s)



[like Citrix environments you'll run into](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m01s)

[is gone you guys my mom's gone when they](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m09s)



[log back in and any blocking modes that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m15s)



[should require will complete without any](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m18s)



[user interaction Oh see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m21s)



[so apparently is the initialization is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m25s)



[Windows desktop session causes Windows](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m27s)



[to be redrawn not horribly surprised at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m29s)



[that which triggers the unloaded and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m32s)



[then the loaded events of the dialog](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m34s)

[is reopened if it was forcibly closed](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m48s)



[let's see here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m52s)



[so current value is opens oh let's use](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h36m59s)



[the was closed on unloading but one](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m09s)



[thing that is missing from this sample](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m18s)



[is when this field would be set back to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m19s)



[false right like it clearly it happens](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m23s)



[here would say you unload a dialog post](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m26s)



[without triggering this event right this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m29s)



[thing will just sit at true for the next](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m33s)



[one which may or may not matter right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m35s)



[this is an instance field and this thing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m39s)



[is unloaded I'm wondering if we need it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m41s)



[though right how often our instance is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m46s)



[unloaded and then reloaded chooses](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h37m52s)



[available here again so let's let's take](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m02s)



[a look at this because I did the hard](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m11s)



[part here is I'm not going to be able to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m13s)



[easily reproduce this I don't think I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m15s)



[can easily reproduce this now I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m19s)



[like I mean I could go through the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m23s)



[efforts of spinning a remote desktop](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m25s)

[overkill though I might do the work and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m30s)



[then hold off merging it until I can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m38s)

[garbage cannibal language that depends](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m47s)



[on who you ask my answer is I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m51s)



[c-sharp is the best language out there](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m54s)



[well it is definitely one of the top](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h38m56s)



[languages there are other languages out](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m00s)



[there that are very good and tend to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m02s)



[more purpose-built people will make very](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m04s)



[good arguments for something like rust](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m07s)



[for example Java](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m09s)



[I think it's very it's fallen prey to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m12s)



[its own success in some ways and that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m17s)



[they they are very much tied to not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m21s)



[breaking backwards compatibility and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m23s)



[that limits them on a lot of their](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m25s)



[features and so you get a lot of really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m26s)



[sub optimal implementations generics is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m30s)



[one of the first ones that comes to mind](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m34s)



[and how much of a pain it is there's a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m36s)



[lot of just weird idiosyncrasies with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m39s)



[Java where it doesn't work the way you'd](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m41s)



[expect yeah or even things like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m44s)



[declaring the exceptions thrown from a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m50s)



[method right like that was something new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m53s)



[a novel that Java tried and no one after](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m55s)



[them copied it so I think we can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h39m58s)



[conclude that's not a success but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m01s)



[because they don't want like to break](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m04s)



[stuff falls back](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m06s)



[do I like Python um so I will say I've](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m08s)



[only used it a little bit so I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m15s)



[know if I've got a great perspective I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m18s)



[think Python is a is a very reasonable](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m19s)



[language there's a lot of people who](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m21s)



[make very good use of it I've got some](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m24s)



[co-workers who are very good at Python](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m26s)



[and they love it so um the only part](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m28s)



[about it that kind of gets weird to me](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m32s)



[is I'm very used to my C style languages](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m35s)



[I like my curly braces and structuring](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m38s)



[things that way the whitespace](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m40s)



[stuff is weird to me but it's really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m41s)



[easy to do it like it's really easy to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m45s)



[get stuff going very fast and Stan stuff](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m47s)



[up quickly so and in a lot of ways I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m50s)



[know even the university that I teach at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m54s)



[they use Python in a lot of their](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m57s)



[introduction classes and I think it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h40m59s)



[largely due to the fact that pythons are](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m03s)



[very approachable and easy to use](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m05s)



[language so I'll say that like it's so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m06s)



[do I like it personally no but I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m09s)



[think it's necessarily a bad language I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m12s)



[think it's just I've had very little](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m15s)



[reason to use it in my development](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m16s)



[career so me but there I know there's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m19s)



[plenty of people that use it with quite](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m24s)



[a bit of success](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m26s)



[okay something-something dialog host](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m28s)



[let's see so we were looking at the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m32s)



[loaded unloaded callbacks which is where](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m37s)



[we were landing on this close the unit](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m40s)



[tests from don't need you for the moment](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m43s)



[where is my loading an onload event uh](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m45s)



[the c-sharp have a library similar to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m49s)



[pandas like python has that's a great](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m52s)



[question um I don't know what that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h41m56s)



[library is data analysis library ooh](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m00s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m07s)



[huh so this is a great question so and I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m13s)



[believe the answer is yes but I yeah I I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m17s)



[don't know I probably have to poke](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m25s)



[around for it so the one thing I will](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m28s)



[say is Python I know is used a lot in Rd](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m30s)



[and academia type stuff because it's got](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m35s)



[a lot of these types of libraries built](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m37s)



[around it you'll find people that do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m41s)



[like computer vision stuff with OpenCV](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m42s)



[really like python because it's got a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m45s)



[lot of nice bindings already built into](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m47s)



[it there's a lot of people who do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m49s)



[effectively like this data analysis](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m51s)



[stuff with Python because it's really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m54s)



[quick and really easy to manipulate it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m56s)



[with if that's the type of work you're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h42m58s)



[doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m01s)



[I found sort of got a they were kind of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m02s)



[got a corner on the market almost to say](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m08s)



[or at least they're definitely one of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m11s)



[the top contenders because of all of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m12s)



[these integrations that they've got and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m14s)



[they do tend to get nice performance out](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m16s)



[of it too because python is underlined](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m18s)



[see core basically on top of it um as](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m22s)



[for a fee Sharpe has one of these I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m28s)



[don't know well](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m31s)



[let's just look because there's been](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m36s)



[plenty of like people love their c-sharp](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m39s)



[and report stuff but I and so the answer](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m41s)



[is yes there's a c-sharp part of it but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m45s)



[how good this is and what kind of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m47s)



[feature parity it is when I see things](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m50s)



[like this where it shows a hundred and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m52s)



[forty downloads acting a little hesitant](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m54s)



[to tell you to switch to it but there is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h43m56s)



[a lot of in this core article might](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m00s)



[yield interesting stuff there are a lot](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m04s)



[of libraries specifically because of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m06s)



[big data work being done in Azure that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m09s)



[that Microsoft has been doing that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m12s)



[there's there's a lot more data analytic](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m14s)



[stuff coming up it's not necessarily](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m18s)



[always exposed directly via the language](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m20s)



[sometimes it comes up via like service](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m22s)



[type stuff and so it's not necessarily](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m27s)



[the same level of control and that may](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m29s)



[or may not work for what you're doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m31s)



[right so unfortunately the short answer](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m33s)



[is I don't know and I'd be hesitant to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m37s)



[try and give it a Thorat ativ answer](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m40s)



[okay here's the two methods interested](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m43s)



[so on unloaded I'm sort of wondering](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m46s)



[because there's multiple ways where](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m56s)



[where something can get unloaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h44m59s)



[usually the unloaded event occurs](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m03s)



[because something's being removed from](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m06s)



[the visual tree so typically if you've](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m07s)



[got a dialogue host it's inside of a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m10s)



[user control you know maybe you throw](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m12s)



[away that view it's going to trigger an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m15s)



[unloaded it and all this is doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m17s)



[because this is ultimately the problem](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m21s)



[here right I've set the current value to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m24s)



[false and the only reason this exists](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m27s)



[here is because the default dialog host](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m29s)



[shows the dialogue inside of a pop-up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m36s)



[right and a pop-up is a lightweight](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m38s)



[window so it's basically a second window](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m41s)



[but as the name implies it's designed to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m44s)



[dismiss these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m48s)



[right it doesn't have everything that a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m49s)



[full window has where's my dialogues](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m52s)



[dialogues but I am loving that right so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m55s)



[if you do this this guy here is shown](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h45m59s)



[inside of a pop-up interesting now it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m01s)



[just a little weirdness in the animation](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m08s)



[there I don't know if it's probably too](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m10s)



[subtle to notice across the stream but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m12s)



[this here is a pop-up control so the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m15s)



[idea being that when this guy is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m18s)



[unloaded we want to make sure we close](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m21s)



[this but I'm wondering if because the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m23s)



[whole the whole problem with this this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m28s)



[bug that's here right is that line and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m30s)



[I'm wondering if we even need it so for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m34s)



[example because the issue here being](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m39s)



[described right is effectively making](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m42s)



[sure to recall is open right when the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m45s)



[thing is redone but the only reason we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m50s)



[need a call is opening and set it to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m52s)



[true is because it was set to false over](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m53s)



[here so I'm not 100% sure that it even](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h46m55s)



[needs to be closed okay testing time I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m00s)



[what I'm curious is will the pop-up](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m09s)



[closed if it's dialogue host is unloaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m12s)



[right so that's kind of what I want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m17s)



[know and I don't actually know the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m20s)



[answer to that so but I do know how to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m23s)



[find out which is the most important](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m27s)



[thing in here so let's take one of these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m31s)



[instances right and let's figure out how](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m33s)



[to do this so I basically want to put](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m36s)



[this thing into a template where I can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m39s)



[throw it away so hmm I don't know kind](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m41s)



[of don't want to think too hard uh](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m49s)



[what's much of this isn't the code](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m53s)



[behind Oh few too many things for me to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m55s)



[just blindly throw away everything](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h47m59s)



[let's just throw away this one mo right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m03s)



[so I want to get rid of this just like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m05s)



[throw all that code away because that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m11s)



[not going to matter so content presenter](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m13s)



[or about content control right the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m17s)



[content binding current content so I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m21s)



[believe this guy here has a view model](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m29s)



[behind him let's see a lot of people at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m34s)



[my work just write a bunch of lines in](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m38s)



[notepad plus plus and then copy and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m40s)



[paste into a Python interpreter as long](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m41s)



[as it works they don't care and never](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m43s)



[look at it again kind of a bummer as I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m44s)



[wanted to learn how to make maintainable](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m48s)



[stuff yeah I can understand that I've](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m50s)



[sort of noticed that there's a common](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m54s)



[pattern around people who become really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m56s)



[good developers and and people who don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h48m59s)



[is they usually that desire to try and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m03s)



[make things better they want to look at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m06s)



[code and try to figure out how can I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m08s)



[improve this it's always the people who](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m10s)



[are willing to just go and good enough](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m13s)



[that never seem to advance and that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m16s)



[probably true beyond just programming](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m18s)



[right I imagine that extends out to a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m20s)



[lot of other fields as well I'm actually](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h49m23s)

[on property changed do we not have an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h52m20s)



[overload that takes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h52m23s)

[like that ok what are you squawking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h53m55s)



[about Oh our command implementation](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h53m58s)



[apparently always wants parameters great](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m03s)



[that's fine ok so let's see if current](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m05s)



[content is no I'm going to do this we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m16s)



[going to set it up else we're just going](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m20s)



[to null it out see how well that works](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m23s)



[I'm realizing there might be a small](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m31s)



[timing issue here see here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m33s)



[and the current content gets new dialog](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m38s)



[hosts so this should trigger let's break](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m47s)



[this guy into a local worker Oh dialog](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m51s)



[post gets boom boom so that should](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h54m55s)



[trigger the loaded event if I'm not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m00s)



[mistaken and then dialog post of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m02s)



[show dialog object content new text](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m08s)



[block come on go look it up trust me you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m16s)



[know it exists and then the text](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m20s)



[property of this will be testing right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m23s)



[simple sweet see a sigmoid which is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m27s)



[generally to be avoided but we're going](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m35s)



[to do it anyway](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m36s)



[no what we're just going to wondering if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m41s)



[I should worry about closing it or just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m48s)



[knowing the fucker out you know what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m50s)



[we'll just know it out okay let's see if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m51s)



[it works that being always the most](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m54s)



[critical - okay so something something](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h55m59s)



[something](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m11s)



[show me dialogues boom there's the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m12s)



[testing the problem is I'm realizing I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m19s)



[can't click my own button because it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m21s)



[underneath my own dialogue which is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m23s)



[problematic so we'll just put them next](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m27s)



[to each other so grid row definitions](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m30s)



[right so we'll have 1 row definition](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m34s)



[that'll fill space one row definition](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m36s)



[that will have a height to Votto and we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m38s)



[will just move the button down grid Row](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m42s)



[1 try it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m45s)



[and I kind of want to go through and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m53s)



[change this guy here well let's just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h56m55s)



[make sure this guy works first and then](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m04s)



[we'll get around to making sure the rest](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m07s)



[of it goes so there's that okay so that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m11s)



[sort of answers my question right if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m16s)



[this guy gets unloaded that means the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m20s)



[pop up gets unloaded and setting and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m23s)



[setting is open to false is kind of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m27s)



[meaningless let's just validate well](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m30s)



[let's see this right so this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m33s)



[triggering they're closing all right so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m37s)



[now the question is does it well let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m40s)



[make sure I hit loaded all right so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m43s)



[there's there gets loaded because we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m45s)



[bringing it in and created a new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m49s)



[instance of it gets added to the visual](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m50s)



[tree there gets unloaded and we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m52s)



[toggling these open a property to false](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m55s)



[so the next question is if I remove this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h57m57s)



[line does the pop-up still close right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m01s)



[because that's that's the kicker because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m06s)



[if they see if the pop-up handles its](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m10s)



[tape for me then I don't care about this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m13s)



[line](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m17s)



[the spelling counts to two so there it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m24s)



[opens and there it closes so I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m30s)



[questioning if I need this line because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m36s)



[I'm not horribly surprised that this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m38s)



[line doesn't do anything right because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m40s)



[if this this the instance gets unloaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m41s)



[okay let's try one more thing I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m48s)



[curious what happens if I use only a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m50s)



[single instance right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m55s)



[so rather than its Stan cheating in new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m56s)



[instance every time all right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h58m58s)



[so for our dialogue host don't quit your](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m01s)



[whinin sure fine whatever right so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m07s)



[or did this let's just do this so if I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m25s)



[can check the current state of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m30s)



[dialog host vo this is all kinds of all](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m33s)



[kinds of broken okay private](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m43s)



[dialogue host spelling counts](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m46s)



[so if dialogue post the current session](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=00h59m57s)



[let's just check is open right that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m09s)



[should be so if it's not open we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m12s)



[going to trigger a show it is open we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m17s)



[just won't do anything planned curious](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m20s)



[if this if this changes any behavior](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m24s)



[right because now the pop-up isn't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m26s)



[available for garbage collection so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m31s)



[before when we know that out nothing was](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m34s)



[then holding a reference to the dialogue](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m35s)



[host and it was then available to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m37s)



[cleaned up I'm curious what happens if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m39s)



[that's not true](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m43s)



[there it is goes away it is interesting](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m45s)



[I don't know if people are noticing but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m54s)



[right over on the left hand side](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m55s)



[underneath my solution Explorer you'll](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h00m57s)



[notice that thing is the the pop-up is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m02s)



[jumping to that side I don't recall if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m05s)



[that was there before or not now](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m08s)



[admittedly this is sort of a very weird](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m11s)



[dialogue set up right we're sort of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m13s)



[optimizing for a use case I'm sort of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m17s)



[curious so I'm coming back in here again](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m21s)



[right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m23s)



[you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m28s)



[you know I'm going to propose I propose](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m34s)



[that we just whack that one line it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m39s)



[doesn't appear to be a reason to need](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m42s)



[this and I think that solves this but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m45s)



[based on the description right because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m54s)



[before they were just resetting is open](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m57s)



[back to true I'm going to propose we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h01m59s)



[just don't do that anymore all right so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m04s)



[let's create a branch back here create](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m06s)



[branch fix 16 18 16 18 boom and I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m09s)



[I only want the dialogue host here I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m18s)



[think what we can do so I think I can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m25s)



[write a unit test on this dialogue host](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m29s)



[test because we've already got tests](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m36s)



[raised event right so this this I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m39s)



[is testable so we're gonna we're going](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m42s)



[to try this I have been trying to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m45s)



[better about making sure that things](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m48s)



[that are testable in this library get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m50s)



[unit tests as they get fixed so as our](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m52s)



[issue number again 1618](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m56s)



[because I do believe that good testing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h02m59s)



[practices are are a must because as soon](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m02s)



[as you get a bunch of people contribute](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m09s)

[dialogue host is unloaded is open](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m20s)



[remains true and this way if this test](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m25s)



[ever breaks in the future so let's go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m30s)



[back let's go back and change this right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m35s)



[so we're going to undo the change right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m37s)



[we want the test to go from false to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m40s)



[true we want to see red and then go to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m42s)



[green so back up in our constructor](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m45s)



[we saw that this is the magical way to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m48s)



[go through and trigger the the loaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m50s)



[event so what we can do down here right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m53s)



[is we want to effectively do dialogue](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h03m56s)



[host is open gets true right we want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m00s)



[trigger the unloaded event unloaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m05s)



[event and then we want to assert C is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m09s)



[true that the dialogue host is open so I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m13s)



[want to see this test fail I guess it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m22s)



[doesn't need a basing Chris just go void](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m25s)



[all right - you know one okay that was](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m28s)



[like that so I want to see that assert](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m31s)



[fail first then we'll go and make the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m34s)



[code change and verify that it then goes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m36s)



[green okay](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m38s)



[so it did in fact fail the assertion](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m51s)



[failed if we come over here I remove the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m54s)



[line of code that I believe is the fix](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h04m58s)



[and we run the test again I should see a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m00s)

[hooray let's add that change in here so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m18s)



[we want unit tests to go with it let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m22s)



[see I think both of these changes here](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m26s)



[were just me doing my proof-of-concept](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m28s)



[stuff so we're just going to discard](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m30s)



[those so those away and so all we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m33s)



[left with is the dialogue hose dialogue](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m38s)



[hose test so no longer setting is open](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m40s)



[falls on unloaded it is not appear to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m48s)



[needed as the pop-up will close its self](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h05m55s)



[it is it is unloaded Marc you're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m02s)



[interrupting my stream Oh see unloaded](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m09s)



[okay let's just check and make sure we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m16s)



[are on our new branch great commit](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m19s)



[changes push push](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m21s)



[and I suspect our other one is probably](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m24s)



[done I hope so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m27s)

[double-check that this guy is in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m44s)



[right milestone and he's now closed](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m45s)



[great great we are going to do one more](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m47s)



[pull request over here compare and pull](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h06m52s)

[comment on there let's see after some](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m10s)



[testing it appears that we don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m14s)

[leave will also fix your issue](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m38s)



[bum-bum-bum comment there we're going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m43s)



[wait for the unit test to run this guy](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m48s)



[definitely just going to refresh real](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m49s)



[quick okay so doc cover reports binding](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m52s)



[leaks](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m59s)



[I've a Glee remember this one yeah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h07m59s)



[so this this comes down to a problem](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m06s)



[that occurs if you bind through an](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m10s)



[object that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m13s)



[doesn't implement inotify property](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m15s)



[change so in this case here right we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m18s)



[binding through a point object to get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m22s)



[its Y property so floating offset is of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m25s)



[type system drawing dot point I believe](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m28s)



[and we're just trying to get the Y off](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m32s)



[of it this end is ends up call causing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m35s)



[binding leaks so I've got a link in my](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m38s)



[comment here to the docs or it actually](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m41s)



[goes through and jetbrains has done a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m43s)



[great job writing up what causes the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m46s)



[leak how to detect it how to fix it all](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m49s)



[that jazz](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m51s)



[for our purposes in this particular case](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m53s)



[what appears to probably be the the best](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h08m56s)



[best selection right is to go through](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m00s)



[and change up so let's just go look this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m03s)



[up so smart hint we're going to go let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m07s)



[pull master and switch there right and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m12s)



[close all documents switch back so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m18s)



[whereas this smart hint line 154 so if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m21s)



[we go down here to themes smart hint 154](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m25s)



[it's these two guys here that are that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m35s)



[are ultimately causing causing us the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m38s)



[grief rank of trying to figure out how](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m41s)



[to do this and so translate transform](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m44s)



[I'm wondering if it's what was a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m49s)



[translate transform so yeah so he was](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m52s)



[suggesting that rather than doing these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m55s)



[weird double multi binding stocks right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m56s)



[which is going through the point to get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h09m59s)



[to the individual properties and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m01s)



[functionally causing us the problem a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m02s)



[much simpler solution a kennel osaki](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m05s)



[Yoko how you doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m11s)



[Magnus is suggestion here I think is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m14s)



[probably the better one which is reduce](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m16s)



[it down to something something much](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m19s)



[simpler floating in transform converter](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m21s)



[Oh see let's just take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m23s)



[the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m28s)



[Translate converter and see so this is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m29s)



[okay so this is just our math converter](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m33s)



[so nothing fancy I think we need a new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m35s)



[converter then do see what do I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m39s)



[about braised blazer oh boy I think that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m48s)



[I need to have a lot more time to play](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m52s)



[with it is it a JavaScript killer I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m54s)



[don't think so not yet like over the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h10m59s)



[last several years there's been a lot of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m02s)



[people who have claimed to have the next](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m04s)



[JavaScript killer and it's never fully](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m09s)



[panned out like JavaScript is still the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m13s)



[assembly language of the web and I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m16s)



[expect that to change anytime soon](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m18s)



[plays are still relatively do but it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m23s)



[pretty exciting especially looking at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m25s)



[their demos and all of the stuff that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m28s)



[people are able to build with it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m30s)



[so it looks pretty slick](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m32s)



[yeah so I think it is new and awesome](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m37s)



[and I will say I am cautiously](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m41s)



[optimistic right I want to see I want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m45s)



[see see you see it run more I don't know](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m49s)



[if I'm quite at the place where I would](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m53s)



[go through and build a production thing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m54s)



[in it but I would certainly go through](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m56s)



[and and demo and play with it I'm trying](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h11m57s)



[to remember they released Glaser](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m01s)



[server-side only I think as GA and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m03s)



[client is still preview or soon to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m07s)



[released maybe just released something](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m10s)



[in that range because the client-side](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m12s)



[blazer stuff is is very new yeah so I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m15s)



[think it is definitely a blazer server](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m23s)



[is released and is client released or is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m27s)



[it still kind of yeah not others yet so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m29s)



[yeah I I think it is it is cool and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m32s)



[awesome and I like seeing them push I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m36s)



[think everybody's been kind of looking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m38s)



[for rather than all of these like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m39s)



[that just try to make JavaScript more](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m42s)



[usable and more more workable like how](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m46s)



[could we functionally change the web to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m49s)



[be to be what we want it to be right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m52s)



[like we don't want just this loose](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m55s)



[transaction list model where we spend](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h12m59s)



[all our time building up strings and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m02s)



[work in JavaScript Vail I mean](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m04s)



[typescript - to some degree is like okay](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m08s)



[let's let's try and fix all the problems](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m10s)



[with JavaScript let's let's make it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m12s)



[strongly typed let's get ourselves to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m15s)



[where we can actually reason about our](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m17s)



[code better so I'll be excited to see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m18s)



[where Blazer goes I'll say that if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m22s)



[that's a reasonable enough answer](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m25s)



[I'm multi-value converter apparently](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m28s)



[tonight I cannot talk and type so that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m34s)



[exciting and I'm halfway through my](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m38s)



[Mountain Dew so I've got about a half of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m43s)



[Mountain Dew left of time in me before I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m44s)



[run out of caffeine in force to crash](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m49s)



[it's also weird like I'm I'm traveling](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m52s)



[right now and there's only an hour time](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m55s)



[difference um amazing how much that our](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h13m58s)



[effects you okay so I already forgot](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m01s)



[what am I taking in I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m06s)



[taking in a scale and a floating offset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m08s)



[so let's go and just double check what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m14s)



[those properties are I'm pretty sure I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m16s)



[know what those are so what do you mean](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m17s)



[you can't navigate sometimes Visual](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m23s)



[Studio sometime you annoy me okay so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m28s)



[where is the scale host so scale is a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m35s)



[double that's all I want it that's all I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m38s)



[want it so step one if Z values that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m41s)



[length it's two and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m50s)



[let's see values of zero is double scale](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h14m55s)



[because it is worth noting when you're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m00s)



[doing value composers these arbitraries](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m02s)



[values that will come into you you will](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m04s)



[get a dependency property come on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m07s)



[include unset value past you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m14s)



[specifically in case where things just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m17s)



[haven't been initialized yet so you want](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m19s)



[to make sure that you always handle that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m22s)



[case it's very common with multi value](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m24s)



[converters to have one binding resolved](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m26s)



[first and so you'll get an array where](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m29s)



[you know maybe you've got double in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m31s)



[first element and the second element is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m32s)



[dependency property onset value so when](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m35s)



[writing converters always make sure to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m40s)



[handle both cases and I believe the next](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m42s)



[one is going to be a drawing point but](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m46s)



[again I want to confirm that so template](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m48s)



[a parent uh floating scale oh and this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m50s)



[has a no content floating scale is that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h15m57s)



[whoo that's just one why do we have this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m02s)



[so I think the short version is return](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m14s)



[one okay that's a lot simpler of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m17s)



[floating offset so this is inside of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m22s)



[smart hint so let's go and look at the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m25s)



[smart hint class of floating offset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m27s)



[floating offset and it is a system](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m33s)



[windows point seeing this why we double](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m40s)



[check Oh see so point and make sure you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m42s)



[are the right one just a windows point](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m47s)



[floating offset all right so let's move](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m53s)



[you how am i doing this this is why we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h16m58s)



[can dock our windows right so that we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m01s)



[can do this kind of stuff is that what's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m03s)



[supposed to be uh](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m06s)



[here so this down here down here this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m09s)



[guy so this is effectively what we want](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m12s)



[to build up so in the case where we have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m15s)



[this far](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m17s)



[translate transform gets new translate](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m22s)



[transform alright cuz we're going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m29s)



[build one of these guys think doesn't I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m31s)



[don't think one is what we want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m38s)



[return right translate transform don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m40s)



[you have like a yeah identity that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m43s)



[what we want to return in the else case](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m47s)



[effectively if any of these aren't said](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m49s)



[we just want to fall back and use the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m51s)



[other one so this is the case we need to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m53s)



[duplicate what we were previously doing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h17m58s)



[in a bunch of bindings so the X portion](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m00s)



[gets scale times the floating offset X](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m03s)



[and and Y gets scaled x floating offset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m13s)



[Y boom just like that alright simple](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m24s)



[easy straightforward easily](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m33s)



[oh is this a okay great so this guy down](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m39s)



[here um well let's just take one inch](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m46s)



[multi bindings well tweak it right see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m52s)



[we don't want it to be translate](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m56s)



[transform with one inside the transform](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m58s)



[group and we need to include this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h18m59s)



[converter first but let's do scale](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m04s)



[floating offset come back up here and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m07s)



[this guy I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m14s)



[repurpose him right so we're going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m16s)



[we're just going to do this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m19s)



[this operation that want to make sense](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m21s)



[get rid of that and I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m25s)



[get rid of this too I think we're about](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m27s)



[to obsolete it if I end up needing hold](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m31s)



[up I'm just noticing I got two](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m39s)



[transforms here this one and this one so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m41s)



[I can't obsolete that one yet](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m51s)



[okay that's fine we'll leave it I'll](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m53s)



[leave it alone](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m56s)



[and then this guy gets here floating](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h19m56s)



[transform and then this whole guy goes](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m01s)



[way translate transform well so first of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m04s)



[all let's just go through and make sure](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m12s)



[that all of our stuff works all right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m14s)



[and then we'll write some tests over](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m18s)



[this but I think it's fairly](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m20s)



[straightforward so is he just thinking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m21s)



[if we use Blaser server as GUI instead](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m29s)



[of WPF forms yeah I think that's the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m32s)



[really the end goal of what people would](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m37s)



[love to get to right is they'd love to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m39s)



[effectively have an app that they could](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m42s)



[host on their web server and have from](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m44s)



[all perspectives have it feel like a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m48s)



[normal Windows app and have it flow](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m52s)



[through the web I mean that was the goal](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m55s)



[with Silverlight right and I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m57s)



[that's what's why some people are really](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h20m59s)



[has a tint on blazer is they see it as](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m01s)



[almost silverlight v2 I don't think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m05s)



[that's fully accurate there's been a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m10s)



[bunch that's changed since Silverlight](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m12s)



[was out there most notably webassembly](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m15s)



[which I think sort of changes the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m19s)



[playing field uh in a in a really good](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m23s)



[way](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m28s)



[see see multi binding cannot be put off](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m28s)



[I don't think we actually need the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m35s)



[transform group anymore though right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m37s)



[we're just going to bind straight in so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m39s)



[I yeah so I think that's part of why I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m42s)



[think a lot of people are I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m46s)



[probably in the same boat as me where](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m50s)



[it's a little more hesitant on Blaser to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m52s)



[like yeah we've seen this tried before](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m54s)



[but the plane feels different this time](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m56s)



[right like there's a lot a lot more](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h21m58s)



[stuff that's made the web a lot better](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m01s)



[than when Silverlight was just trying to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m04s)



[effectively be an abstraction over it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m06s)



[and even to some degree like the old um](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m09s)



[asp net web form stuff tried to do kind](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m12s)



[of the same thing where it was like oh](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m16s)



[we're going to handle state for you and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m18s)



[will persist it and yeah did quite work](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m20s)



[and it ended up being that's that's not](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m23s)



[the solution people need okay so looking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m27s)



[to test so like the smart hint would be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m34s)



[the name here floating hint there](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m36s)



[floating password there's a large font](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m39s)



[just fine that works well for the scale](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m45s)



[I believe this is all it's all low and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m51s)



[good these ones here are actually the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m57s)



[ones I would expect to be the most](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h22m59s)



[problematic right because their position](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m01s)



[you have to land right on top of the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m04s)



[group box border for it to look right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m07s)



[and I guess it's not a group box for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m08s)



[this is text box for it because that is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m10s)



[the style that style material designed](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m13s)



[outline text field text box great so I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m18s)



[think so I think this is fine I mean it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m23s)



[would be good to go through and actually](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m29s)



[validate the memory leak but I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m30s)



[what I'm more interested in doing right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m34s)



[now is actually writing a unit test on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m36s)



[this so specifically the floating hint](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m38s)



[converter we didn't obsolete anything we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m41s)



[can remove so let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m45s)



[let's try this and more importantly do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m49s)



[we have I don't know if I can new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h23m52s)



[folders the thing that I'm noticing is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m00s)



[this guy is marked as internal right and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m06s)



[so that leaves me only two two](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m08s)



[reasonable choices I guess right so unit](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m13s)



[test classic Republic C and I think we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m18s)



[need SG a fact because we're instantiate](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m23s)



[in UI objects public void when I think I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m25s)



[actually want Theory](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m33s)



[FBA for when you can't spell when](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m38s)



[there's not set it returns I then to T](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m48s)



[ah typing is really really hard tonight](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h24m58s)



[okay so this guy here in line data we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m03s)



[going to give it basically two options](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m08s)



[right so object scale object offset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m09s)



[right so I basically want to be able to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m19s)



[inject a couple things here so for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m20s)



[example both values are no that's that's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m22s)



[an easy case the unused parameter scale](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m26s)



[yes for sure so far converter gets new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m30s)



[that thing here's where I think we run](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m35s)



[into our first problem right is because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m39s)



[this guy's internal I have no way of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m41s)



[looking at it so two options I make the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m43s)



[converter public one and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m47s)



[decide if that's the right option and it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m51s)



[probably is the only thing with making](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m53s)



[this public is now it's part of my](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m55s)



[public API and if I want to change this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h25m57s)



[that's a break](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m00s)



[change to people whereas if I keep it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m01s)



[internal then I don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m02s)



[about it and we actually have a bunch of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m04s)



[converters that are internal the problem](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m06s)



[is to leave an internal means that I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m10s)



[have to effectively go through and do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m13s)



[something fancy with my attributes right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m14s)



[and do something like assembly internals](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m17s)



[visible too and then Tyrell design](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m22s)



[themes WPF tests all right so this now](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m28s)



[lets me in my unit test project access](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m33s)



[things that are flagged as eternal as](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m37s)



[though they were public I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m39s)



[decide if I actually even like this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m46s)



[right like internals visible to is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m48s)



[usually a code smell because it means](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m49s)



[that your abstraction level is wrong and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m52s)



[you're you're effectively testing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m55s)



[internal to your library the problem is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h26m57s)



[in this case this is a WPF demian](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m00s)



[library and most of the stuff isn't very](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m02s)



[testable anyway because we're we rely on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m03s)



[the WPF framework so I think I do that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m08s)



[all right see if this guy gets built](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m16s)



[because I have to compile him so that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m21s)



[that attributes in it then I think this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m23s)



[works I think now we just to do boom now](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m27s)



[they using statements there and we can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m35s)



[get access to them just torn on whether](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m36s)



[that's actually the right answer so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m41s)



[result gets and not converters converter](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m44s)



[all right I can spell converter converts](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m48s)



[dude so scale offset let's see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h27m53s)



[target type is going to be type of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m01s)



[transform](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m06s)



[I think what I'm going to do is private](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m10s)



[static object convert so you know what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m14s)



[let's let's do this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m26s)



[so I'm a big fan of unit tests and I'm a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m30s)



[huge fan if things are hard to test it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m33s)



[means you probably need to spend more](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m37s)



[time working on your unit test so I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m38s)



[believe that my unit tests project](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m40s)



[should be as nice as the production code](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m41s)



[if not nicer because it's what is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m44s)



[effectively being used to check all of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m46s)



[the stuff so I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m49s)



[do is invoking these convert methods is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m51s)



[pain-in-the-neck mostly because you have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m54s)



[to provide all these extra parameters](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m57s)



[and that's hard right like depending on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h28m58s)



[the converter type knowing all of these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m01s)



[things isn't necessarily simple you have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m04s)



[to pass in you know about parameters and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m07s)



[you have to handle culture info](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m10s)



[and make sure that you get that correct](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m13s)



[UI culture right I'm wondering about](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m17s)



[just doing an extension method on value](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m22s)



[converter that just simplifies all of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m25s)



[this right problem is both of these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m28s)



[would have to be specified because it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m32s)



[really only saves me a couple around](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m38s)



[whatever we'll just leave it like this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m39s)



[for now but I am keeping that in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m40s)



[back of my mind so assert equal and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m43s)



[doing too much MS test transform dot](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m47s)



[identity I'm kind of curious those two](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m51s)



[things should be the same right yeah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m55s)



[decompile show me what this what this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h29m59s)



[looks like so this is a static instance](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m02s)



[so it will be the same instance in all](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m06s)



[cases great so I don't care whether this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m08s)



[does reference equality or not should](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m10s)



[work so we're going to test it with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m12s)



[let's see scale you can do it like that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m17s)



[right we can then come over here and do](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m20s)



[offset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m23s)



[which is a what do we say it's a point](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m24s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m30s)



[system windows point this is going to be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m31s)



[so it's just a windows point but I can't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m37s)



[do doesn't have it's not going to let me](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m41s)



[just do I wonder will you let me get](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m48s)



[away with default of point this point is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m51s)



[obstruct alright yeah point is a struct](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h30m53s)



[because going in an attribute okay fine](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m00s)



[then fine so let's see here so rather](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m06s)



[than in line data we can do remember](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m11s)



[data yeah](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m14s)



[so remember name well it's right ok](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m16s)



[right so public static I in numerable of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m26s)



[object array so effectively each](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m36s)



[returned from this guy is going to give](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m39s)



[us an invocation so each element in the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m42s)



[innumerable is going to invoke this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m45s)



[method as part of the unit test and then](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m47s)



[this object array needs to correlate to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m50s)



[the number of parameters here so it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m52s)



[going to be a multi-dimensional](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m55s)



[effectively a 2d array so let's see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h31m59s)



[invalid parameters all right we're just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m02s)



[gonna do do this do this and I think I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m08s)



[can get away with this all right can I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m15s)



[get away with why do I have to do that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m18s)



[see new array issues can be only used in](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m30s)



[Oh so this needs to be that right new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m35s)



[object oh so that I can for the type new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m47s)



[object to do is so we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m53s)



[double and then an oil alright boom boom](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h32m56s)



[so let's just do this copy and then this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m02s)



[one here will become new point so the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m07s)



[advantage of doing this is now I can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m12s)



[control what's going through here so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m14s)



[we'll do and it's the object](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m17s)



[I'm sorry dependency property onset](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m20s)



[value and new point basically every](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m25s)



[possible case that I think might](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m31s)



[actually matter here right I guess we're](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m33s)



[going to need to switch to this anyway](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m38s)



[in order to get this to work so and then](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m39s)



[this becomes a name of operation boom](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m43s)



[all right and so now if I run this I](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m49s)



[expect to see a whole bunch of test runs](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m52s)



[a whole bunch of test runs for each of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m54s)



[these so quick and easy way to do a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h33m59s)



[bunch of tests boom so if we look at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m02s)



[this guy we'll see this here see 1 2 3 4](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m07s)



[5 1 2 3 4 5 5 test pass ok excellent if](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m11s)



[you're using MS test and you do the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m21s)



[equivalent of this you'll actually see a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m24s)



[6 element they have a top-level thing](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m26s)



[and then one for each of the individual](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m29s)



[passions so to reach his own let's see](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m31s)



[so as T aid we don't get the theory](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m36s)



[anymore we need a fact all right the big](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m38s)



[difference between whether it is whether](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m41s)



[this thing's going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m43s)



[data-driven or not so when parameters](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m44s)



[are specified it returns a scale](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m50s)



[transform boom right so we are going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h34m57s)



[do this guy here actually let's do let's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m01s)



[do some inline data all right because we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m10s)



[can go through and effectively change](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m15s)



[this out so inline data and I think what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m16s)



[we're going to do is take in three](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m23s)



[parameters here right so we'll do a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m25s)



[double for the scale a double X and](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m27s)



[double Y and we'll just instantiate the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m32s)



[point here right so rather than taking](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m34s)



[an offset will do new point x and y so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m36s)



[then our data needs to be something like](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m43s)



[this is this is 2 and my X 3 and my Y is](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m46s)



[4 what do I expect back right so this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m53s)



[guy here what do you squawk oh you can](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h35m57s)



[approve the array type because the two](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m01s)



[parameters are different types we need](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m04s)



[some space more high D right okay so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m08s)



[this goes in this comes out we get a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m11s)



[results I'm going to I'm going to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m14s)



[explicitly cast that's right so because](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m17s)



[I want this thing to blow up if fails so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m20s)



[then I expect that result dot scale X to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m27s)



[be scale times X right](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m35s)



[and then I want to do the same thing for](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m40s)



[y I know that it's not what I expect](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m43s)



[because it's it is the translate](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m50s)



[transform not the scale transform I am](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m54s)



[so I expect the ex I was going to say](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h36m59s)



[there's too many properties on this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m03s)



[thing okay so the X&Y should be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m04s)



[appropriately set just for paranoia sake](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m07s)



[and to make sure we don't hard-code you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m12s)



[think we're going to do like 1.5 I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m14s)



[intentionally taking values here that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m19s)



[aren't going to cause weird double](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m21s)



[overflows though because both of these](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m25s)



[are doing the same math they should be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m26s)



[equal in all cases right so I'm trying](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m28s)



[to keep the the numbers the numbers easy](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m32s)



[but I just enough to make sure that this](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m35s)



[thing isn't you know hard-coded to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m37s)



[always do the same exact thing make sure](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m39s)



[it's actually doing some level of math](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m41s)



[poof okay so that covers that that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m47s)



[covers that we can technically test the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m52s)



[length equal to two but it would be](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m57s)



[really really really hard to have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h37m58s)



[anything else happen right because both](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m03s)



[of our tests are effectively always](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m04s)



[passing in two elements so I'm a little](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m06s)



[less concerned about that there was](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m09s)



[there's always a value trade-off with](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m13s)



[how many tests do you write and I don't](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m14s)



[think that's a very valuable one so it's](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m16s)



[more important that we actually have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m20s)



[some level test so let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m22s)



[this so we've got it the assembly info](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m24s)



[changes so whitespace compiler service](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m26s)



[which is needed for the internal](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m29s)



[principle to which we added new](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m30s)



[convertor which we marked as internal so](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m32s)



[it's not part of my public API yet we](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m35s)



[whacked the math converter put in our](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m39s)



[new converter then got rid of all of](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m41s)



[these and went to a single binding](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m44s)



[verified it worked in the UI I am hoping](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m46s)



[to go through and get my Kermie was on](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m50s)



[one of my previous videos we did the](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m53s)



[metamorphic testing if anybody wants to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m55s)



[go find that YouTube video but I'm](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h38m57s)



[wanting to get him back on and start](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m00s)



[building out UI tests for this library](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m02s)



[so that it would be really nice to have](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m04s)



[some level of confidence and let me go](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m06s)



[to ship out and you](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m10s)



[version of the library to make sure that](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m11s)



[it works so you know test there I think](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m12s)



[I want all those changes so switching to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m15s)



[a new converter to avoid memory leaks](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m20s)



[added unit tests for the converter](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m27s)



[enabled internals internal visible to to](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m33s)



[support testing internal converters](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m41s)



[alright so there we go oops I just](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m46s)



[committed that on master that's not what](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m52s)



[we wanted so we come down so we come](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m54s)



[back down here and we say create a](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m57s)



[branch fix and we get our 1649 1649](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h39m59s)



[great and then we just say cherry-pick](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m06s)



[that commit and go ahead and commit it](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m10s)



[so this branch the fixed 1649 is correct](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m15s)



[so we'll go ahead and push that up well](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m19s)



[now my local master branch is not where](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m21s)



[I want it to be so I'm going to switch](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m25s)



[back to it and I'm going to just take](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m26s)



[this branch pointer and reset it back](https://youtu.be/Zvo3sOyL6n8?t=01h40m28s)
