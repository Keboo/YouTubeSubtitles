[okay there's the top there or we are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m00s)



[going to get going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m02s)



[welcome everyone tonight I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m03s)



[something a little bit different](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m06s)



[last time we were working on getting the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m07s)



[material design release out and so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m11s)



[release 30.1 is now out primarily a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m13s)



[bug-fix release but anybody who had been](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m18s)



[struggling with issues with the the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m20s)



[version numbers of the dll's those](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m23s)



[should all be hopefully fixed and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m25s)



[everything's going my intent is to try](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m27s)



[to keep the releases flowing out every](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m29s)



[few weeks just so that things keep going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m32s)



[and keep updating and not necessarily](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m34s)



[block things on a slightly different](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m36s)



[note with that there was a user who](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m40s)



[actually started doing work on you WP](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m42s)



[integration and so that's been an area](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m45s)



[that's been interesting to me and I've](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m48s)



[taken a crack at at a couple times but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m49s)



[ultimately I've never had time to get it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m51s)



[production ready so if anyone is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m53s)



[interested in helping out with that I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m55s)



[believe we're probably going to move in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h00m57s)



[the direction of also supporting you WP](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m00s)



[in addition to WPF primarily for the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m02s)



[purpose of supporting when UI 3 when](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m05s)



[it's eventually ready so we'll probably](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m08s)



[have a few streams where we dive into](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m10s)



[that I know I've mentioned the win UI](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m13s)



[stuff back around the build conference](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m17s)



[when it was first announced it's still](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m18s)



[very much alpha release but it's still](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m21s)



[there and ready to be played with and so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m24s)



[trying to get the library basically into](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m26s)



[a state where it would be easy to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m29s)



[migrate to that so that's the end goal](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m31s)



[just to make sure that this library is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m33s)



[using latest and greatest stuff and it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m35s)



[available for everyone and hopefully get](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m38s)



[a few more users and a lot more reach so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m40s)



[for tonight I'm going back to the stream](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m42s)



[subtitle app that I had going and I'm](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m45s)



[actually gonna flip over here real quick](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m48s)



[because there we go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m50s)



[you'll note there are now subtitles at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m55s)



[the bottom of the screen using the the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h01m58s)



[wonderful app that we built prior](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m00s)



[apparently I am talking too fast and my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m04s)



[little Q on the right is getting really](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m07s)



[big and so it's going to take a while to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m09s)



[catch up so the subtitles are still very](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m10s)



[much delay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m12s)



[but it appears to be working rather well](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m14s)



[so the the current plan for tonight is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m16s)



[to push it into Azure DevOps get a CI CD](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m19s)



[pipeline rolling for it and then go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m24s)



[through and build out hopefully an MSI X](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m28s)



[installer so that I have not done that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m32s)



[yet for a reference for a WPF app so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m35s)



[we're gonna see how it goes and see what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m38s)



[problems there are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m40s)



[but the azure pipeline I think would](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m41s)



[just be highly convenient for most of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m43s)



[this so for anybody who is interested](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m45s)



[let's grab the repo first of all so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m48s)



[let's see github boo-uh something it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h02m51s)



[stream' subtitles something like this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m00s)



[great so here is the for anybody](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m04s)



[interested in following along there is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m07s)



[the the repo link for it and so I have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m09s)



[taken a slight head start in going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m16s)



[through this and have already gone](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m20s)



[through and created an azure devops](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m23s)



[project only because this can sometimes](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m24s)



[take a minute to create and I didn't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m26s)



[want to have a bunch of downtime while I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m28s)



[waited for it so this is basically open](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m30s)



[up azure DevOps log in new project type](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m35s)



[in stream subtitles and that's about it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m38s)



[I don't think I did any changes to it at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m41s)



[all so the project is marked as public](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m44s)



[so people should be able to at least](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m47s)



[view the contents of this but we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m49s)



[going to go through and see about](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m52s)



[setting this up so the first thing we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m53s)



[gonna do is dive into the project](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m54s)



[settings so for starters I don't need a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m56s)



[bunch of stuff my code is on github](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h03m58s)



[I don't need repos mic I don't really](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m00s)



[care about using boards I will probably](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m05s)



[use issues on github instead and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m08s)



[primarily just use this for pipelines](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m12s)



[I'm gonna leave artifacts turned on for](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m14s)



[now only because we maybe that's how we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m16s)



[distribute man I don't know we'll see so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m19s)



[leave that on but pipelines are the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m22s)



[interesting area for now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m24s)



[refresh page to see changes and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m25s)



[ultimately what we're looking for is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m28s)



[these icons on the left to see some of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m29s)



[those guys drop off so hopefully this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m31s)



[fairly quick setting this up so some](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m34s)



[people may notice that my list on the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m38s)



[left differs from what you might see the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m40s)



[reason for that is if you click on the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m43s)



[little person gear and underneath](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m46s)



[preview features I have the multi stage](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m48s)



[pipeline feature turned on so if you are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m51s)



[interested in trying some of the new](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m54s)



[stuff you'll note you can change the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m56s)



[scope of what these toggles do by](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h04m58s)



[default I believe it defaults to just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m00s)



[your user so you can turn them on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m02s)



[without affecting the rest of your team](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m04s)



[but if you have permissions you could](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m07s)



[turn them on for say the entire org my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m09s)



[case just me and then you can go through](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m12s)



[and toggle and play with some of the new](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m14s)



[features and if you don't like them just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m16s)



[switch them back off but they are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m18s)



[usually fairly indicative of the new](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m21s)



[stuff that's coming down the pipe so we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m24s)



[are going to create a new C ICD pipeline](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m26s)



[so CI continuous integration basically](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m30s)



[means that pull requests and merges](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m33s)



[should automatically be built compiled](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m35s)



[in unit test run and then CD continuous](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m38s)



[deployment pushing it out somewhere so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m41s)



[where is my code my code lives on github](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m44s)



[and I've because I've done this many](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m46s)



[times I've got this thing already](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m52s)



[connected out to my github so we'll pick](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m53s)



[that this is a dotnet desktop](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m56s)



[application so we'll go there and poof](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h05m59s)



[we've got a brand new yamo file ready to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m02s)



[go so let's see what did it do for me so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m06s)



[it's going to use the latest version](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m09s)



[windows great doesn't bother me in the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m10s)



[least gonna compile for any CPU this I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m12s)



[think is the first thing that we need to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m16s)



[change if I recall correctly one of the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m18s)



[issues that we ran into this was the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m21s)



[configuration needed to be 64-bit if I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m24s)



[remember platform target x64 so this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m29s)



[highly misleading let's rename this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m33s)



[will it let me edit any CPU no it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m38s)



[gonna go through and see about naming](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m44s)



[this new copy settings great great](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m46s)



[that's probably better and then let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m52s)



[see if we can edit these and remove any](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m54s)



[CPU even though it was using x64 the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h06m58s)



[name of the configuration was any CPU](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m01s)



[and I see that causing some level of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m03s)



[confusion so save and let's just we'll](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m06s)



[commit that really quick I assume let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m10s)



[see CS Braj oh it turned on that oh why](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m12s)



[why did you why did you do this to me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m21s)



[platform targets any cpu what was this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m27s)



[prior ah let's see this is yeah this so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m30s)



[this is a new change yeah I think what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m33s)



[we're gonna do is we're just gonna I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m37s)



[don't want any CPU I want this thing to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m39s)



[run 64-bit and 64-bit only again this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m43s)



[this tool is largely just for me and so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m48s)



[I'm really not concerned about trying to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m52s)



[support a lot of cases because it's my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m55s)



[tool it's my stream first mountain do is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h07m57s)



[almost gone that's not a good sign don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m03s)



[worry I've got multiple Mountain Dews in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m06s)



[queue okay so back to get cracking okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m08s)



[64-bit 64-bit let's see here what did](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m12s)



[you do so any CPU got renamed to x64](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m16s)



[looks like it regenerated a grid for one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m23s)



[of the projects okay let's see adding](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m26s)



[x64 target platform](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m32s)



[uh x64 is usually spelled with a six not](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m39s)



[a seven on most days okay that push](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m42s)



[great and we'll go back to here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m48s)



[so we want to make sure we do the same](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m52s)



[thing in our pipeline so build platform](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m55s)



[isn't going to be an easy CPU it's going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m57s)



[to be x64 so we'll toggle that release](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h08m59s)



[configuration sounds great so it's going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m02s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m06s)



[nougat tools installer and I think I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m06s)



[think I want five num lock v 3o always](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m13s)



[check for newer versions all right I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m21s)



[think that's what I want](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m24s)



[look at that a shot I something the back](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m32s)



[of my mind is telling me that just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m35s)



[running this by itself doesn't guarantee](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m36s)



[the latest version don't know that if](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m38s)



[that's 100% true but I want to double](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m41s)



[check so we're going to try that so new](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m43s)



[go tools installer it's going to run a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m46s)



[new get command which is going to do a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m48s)



[restore which is great on the solution](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m50s)



[perfect it's going to compile the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m53s)



[solution which this is just find me all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m55s)



[the solution files in this case there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h09m59s)



[should only be one so this should just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m01s)



[match any solution file found which we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m03s)



[only have one with the platform of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m05s)



[configuration that we've specified above](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m07s)



[in dev ops or yeah mol I guess this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m09s)



[the variable syntax so you declare a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m13s)



[variable up here with this name and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m16s)



[wrap it dollar sign paren name and that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m19s)



[pushes it through and then it'll run the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m22s)



[unit test for us and that's all she](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m24s)



[wrote so I like it so save and run](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m28s)



[commit directly into the master branch](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m32s)



[sure why not](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m35s)



[and so this is going to trigger on all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m36s)



[things into master which is probably](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m39s)



[what we want for now it's just me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m42s)



[working on it so that sometime we'll get](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m45s)



[into doing pull requests it's worth](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m48s)



[noting if you don't turn on that preview](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m52s)



[feature this screen looks very different](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m54s)



[between the old and the new you is it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m56s)



[felt weird to me when they first put it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h10m59s)



[in but then I I started to get used to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m02s)



[it I think I liked it better sure tough](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m04s)



[to tell](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m09s)



[so this guy here using version 5 3 oh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m09s)



[great](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m13s)



[do wonder if that's gonna bite me at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m18s)



[some point having a hard-coded version](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m20s)



[like that I should look at what the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m23s)



[variables are for the new spec but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m26s)



[regardless it's going to go through and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m28s)



[do new you package restore which I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m30s)



[we only have a handful of them right so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m33s)



[we've got material design the cognitive](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m37s)



[services stuff mvvm light and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m39s)



[obviously the unit tests and coverlet so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m42s)



[not a lot of packages to restore in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m45s)



[theory shouldn't take long](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m48s)



[got mine got mine the other thing that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m52s)



[can be rather unfortunate is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m56s)



[occasionally yeah this thing doesn't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h11m58s)



[necessarily spew output as it goes](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m02s)



[despite the fact that it would be nice](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m04s)



[if it was tailing and then all of a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m05s)



[sudden it just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m07s)



[barfs at all so not necessarily sure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m08s)



[that's a problem of DevOps or if it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m12s)



[the then you get CLI that's doing it or](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m13s)



[whatever but regardless so the thing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m16s)



[compiled great hopefully it finds all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m21s)



[our unit tests that we wrote which](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m25s)



[should all be in a passing state we left](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m26s)



[this I believe with the live unit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m29s)



[testing stuff running yeah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m31s)



[so it should find five tests they should](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m33s)



[all pass everyone should be happy so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m36s)



[let's see here did you do all this stuff](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m39s)



[down here creative publishing test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m42s)



[results zero published test results and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m50s)



[s.vs test where does it say does it did](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m53s)



[it not find my tests did not find my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h12m57s)



[tests what's going on I am confused vs](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m00s)



[test console scroll this whoa whoa oh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m06s)



[there buddy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m11s)



[let's see x64 release blah blah blah net](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m19s)



[core these are all Microsoft thingies](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m25s)



[what it does not look like it picked up](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m33s)



[my dll instead picked up a bunch of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m38s)



[other ones so we might look at whatever](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m43s)



[globbing pattern that's using this test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m44s)



[discovery blah blah blah filters to a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m48s)



[bunch of these things ooh boy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h13m50s)



[come on this horizontal scroll thing is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m00s)



[killing me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m02s)



[did fail to discover tests yeah I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m04s)



[believe that that's interesting so let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m09s)



[jump back here well so we have some](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m16s)



[warnings and it looks like the knowable](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m19s)



[stuff is doing its job which is great](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m24s)



[that's what we expect the test though so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m26s)



[hold on we want all tests](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m35s)



[come on come on DevOps](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m47s)



[failed aborted should not be a hard](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h14m57s)



[thing to load there are no test failures](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m04s)



[that also screams to me that there were](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m07s)



[no test run no test results found yeah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m10s)



[that this one appears to just be causing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m15s)



[this thing to spend](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m20s)



[well okay so regardless we've got an](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m32s)



[issue here so let's go and fix that so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m35s)



[back into our pipeline here edit and how](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m38s)



[are you matching sorry just buzzing away](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m43s)



[and have them fun](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m48s)



[great oh looks like I'm getting email](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m51s)



[notifications about my streams so what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m53s)



[how are you matching so it is looking](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h15m58s)



[for things that have tests in the name](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m02s)



[but not test adapter and not things in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m07s)



[an obj directory okay let's see let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m11s)



[see did you do we already have a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m22s)



[configuration set up the test run title](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m25s)



[build platform built configuration okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m31s)



[so that that seems fine right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m35s)



[see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m45s)



[okay so let's let's take a quick look](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m49s)



[because we haven't actually run this in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m51s)



[release locally so pile and run or I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m53s)



[should say compile and build and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h16m58s)



[we're gonna run I'm just going to verify](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m01s)



[that this does actually in fact work](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m03s)



[locally does it is important the number](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m05s)



[of times I've caught issues we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m09s)



[changing from release to debug causes a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m13s)



[failure or pass it's way too high okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m16s)



[so test build and launch locally so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m20s)



[let's just dive into this guy so what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m23s)



[when this guy compiles and runs should](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m26s)



[be in here and I would expect it to pick](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m34s)



[up test DLL so let's let's look at this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m36s)



[matching pattern here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m46s)



[so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m52s)



[we're gonna be a little more restrictive](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m56s)



[but that matches what we expect our](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h17m59s)



[output to be alright because it should](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m02s)



[end with dot test DLL so hopefully it'll](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m04s)



[parse through a few less things won't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m07s)



[bother to go into obj directors which is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m10s)



[what we want definitely don't want test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m12s)



[adapter DLLs so that should be fine and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m14s)



[oh okay so to do we'll do that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m22s)



[and test selector why was test plan test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m36s)



[assemblies got it so it needs this needs](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m45s)



[this okay save commit now I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m49s)



[because the previous one with that yeah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m55s)



[that'll automatically trigger build so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h18m58s)



[because there was already the Gamal](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m02s)



[saved from our first commit will note](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m03s)



[here we've now got two commits that are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m07s)



[being done by a do as your DevOps](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m09s)



[because there was already one in there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m14s)



[that told it to trigger on master branch](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m16s)



[stuff away we go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m18s)



[hopefully some of this goes a little](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m26s)



[quicker I need to look up there is a way](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m28s)



[to effectively put a new gate cache](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m32s)



[between a do and new georg so that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m36s)



[things go a little bit quicker on this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m39s)



[restorer because as you can see this can](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m42s)



[take up a sizable percentage of your](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m43s)



[build time](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m45s)



[do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m52s)



[come on come on go go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h19m58s)



[I know it's hard](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m02s)



[but I do want to make sure that we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m05s)



[actually see tests go through here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m06s)



[because having a CI pipeline that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m11s)



[doesn't run your test is not that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m13s)



[helpful okay so I just want to confirm](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m15s)



[DEA 1s typically as your dev ops if you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m18s)



[leave things alone you'll have a working](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m23s)



[directory that looks similar to this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m26s)



[build in solution release x64 should](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m29s)



[just work help](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m35s)



[come on total of one test file match the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m41s)



[specified pattern I would hope so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m47s)



[look at that five unit tests huzzah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m50s)



[great so if we go and look at this guy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m55s)



[here I should be able to go here that's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h20m57s)



[what I wanted to see right so 100% test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m00s)



[pass the the time for duration of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m05s)



[running the test is up to nine seconds](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m10s)



[in 14 milliseconds from zero because now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m12s)



[we have tests so sort of expect it to be](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m14s)



[longer perfect done CD or a CI at least](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m17s)



[implemented okay so much for the easy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m24s)



[part so we're gonna pin that guy there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m27s)



[and let's go ahead and just pin this guy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m30s)



[here so this is the next bit to go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m32s)



[through and this is the part I haven't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m35s)



[done before so this is where it probably](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m37s)



[gets more interesting is going through](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m38s)



[and publishing out a WPF app as part of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m40s)



[an MSI X so MSI X was first introduced](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m45s)



[with Windows 8 part of the Metro app](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m48s)



[stuff - no that was a PEX MSI X is the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m52s)



[next version of it don't quote me on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m57s)



[when it came into existence but this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h21m59s)



[the latest installer technology it's how](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m02s)



[like Windows Store packages up apps](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m04s)



[it lets you package your app up in a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m07s)



[nice container and then windows does all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m10s)



[of the nicety stuff for you so this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m14s)



[what we're going to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m16s)



[is important to note if you do not have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m17s)



[the WPF workload installed um no sorry](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m19s)



[you need the WPF workload installed as](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m22s)



[well as the UWP workload you'll note](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m25s)



[from this tutorial I believe at the very](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m29s)



[top an overview it outlines](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m33s)



[CTTT where is it one of these guys shows](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h22m37s)

[friends don't let friends right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m15s)



[click publish because the big issue here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m17s)



[is if developers are right clicking and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m20s)



[publishing the app you have no guarantee](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m22s)



[of consistency right it also means that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m24s)



[you might have to expose things like](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m27s)



[your certificate to your developers and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m29s)



[that's probably not what you want so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m31s)



[what we would like to do is have this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m33s)



[controlled by our as your DevOps](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m35s)

[so you're gonna close back to here right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m44s)



[pipelines and it's gonna go through and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m48s)



[it's gonna do some compiling and some](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m53s)



[thinking and it can think about what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m56s)



[it's done that's fine we're going to do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h51m58s)



[though is we're going to search here and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m01s)



[just see MSI X right that's not helpful](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m03s)



[so the like we could also look up the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m09s)



[msbuild command and figure out what this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m13s)



[guy is executing on the publish so if we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m15s)



[look at let's see deployment maybe no](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m19s)



[build might have to kick one off again](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m25s)



[real quick just to just to see what it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m30s)



[does right because if we get the command](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m32s)



[we can kick it off but I am curious a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m34s)



[lot of times very rarely do you run into](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h52m37s)

[great packaging blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h53m22s)



[blah this is actually probably helpful](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h53m26s)



[because this is showing how to export](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h53m29s)

[control with build variables okay great](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h54m21s)



[let's see I must build so they target](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h54m27s)



[the Lapp project which is what we have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h54m38s)

[doing some stuff passing some parameters](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m15s)



[interesting okay so if this really feels](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m18s)



[like there should be a dotnet CLI](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m25s)



[command for this download secure file](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m27s)



[scripts oh wait what is this doing well](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m31s)

[executing it I don't think you need to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m39s)



[do this I didn't think I'm pretty sure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m42s)



[sign tools available on the path I could](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m46s)



[be wrong so sign the MSI X package and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m51s)



[the this is important here this artifact](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h55m56s)



[staging directory because anything you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m01s)



[put inside of this folder is what's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m03s)



[going to get published out as part of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m05s)



[the artifacts that get uploaded at the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m07s)



[end of the build so when was this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m12s)



[updated June yeah I'm hoping this isn't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m17s)



[my only option but I mean we can we can](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m24s)



[certainly go down this path if we need](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m27s)



[to pipeline configuration I have to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m29s)



[believe](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m36s)



[nabobs alright somebody somebody's made](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m41s)



[an extension I can't believe people are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m46s)



[okay with that really somebody there is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m51s)



[a open field here apparently loaded with](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h56m57s)



[partial name file share yeah because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m04s)



[this is what I was envisioning doing is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m07s)



[dropping it out on a storage account](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m09s)



[somewhere that seems like the easiest](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m11s)



[place to put it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m15s)



[yeah so they're putting it in a in a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m22s)



[file share and then just mounting it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m26s)



[let's see web installs to a web server](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m32s)



[to generate a version that happens to a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m35s)



[file an HTML page this is close to what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m37s)



[we want because I think this is what I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m40s)



[would rather do because just host it in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m42s)



[blob storage I think would be easier I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m47s)



[mean why make myself mount to drive when](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m49s)



[I can just point it at blob storage](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m52s)



[instead so app installer URI](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h57m55s)



[yeah let's go down this path this seems](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m12s)



[like the easiest path forward much to my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m15s)



[chagrin yeah yeah yeah okay so we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m19s)



[gonna need to do a couple things first](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m24s)



[we're gonna need ourselves a storage](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m27s)



[account so let's go set one up so give](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m28s)



[me one moment to get signed in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m36s)



[appropriately and then we will go let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m38s)



[see here so I think we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m43s)



[in its own okay so I think we are going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m52s)



[to create actually let's not put this in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h58m57s)



[its own resource group where is these is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m05s)



[it in automation or just testing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m08s)



[automation so we'll put it here this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m12s)



[will be a fine place for it okay so we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m15s)



[need a storage count yeah one of those](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m19s)



[please create and storage account name](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m28s)



[stream subtitles I think since this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m35s)



[largely for me let's put it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m39s)



[geographically closer to me count tied](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m42s)



[general-purpose that sounds good read](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m45s)



[access](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m52s)



[we're gonna access Geo redundant storage](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m56s)



[I don't this is right this is not going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=00h59m59s)



[to be a hot item this is gonna be](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m04s)



[something that gets hit once a week by](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m06s)



[one user that doesn't sound like I need](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m11s)



[a hot tier for it so networking public](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m13s)



[endpoint yes we're gonna let anyone](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m19s)



[download secure transfer required sure I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m21s)



[don't know if that's gonna make a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m28s)



[difference well rich file shares off](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m29s)



[soft to leadoff blah blah blah great](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m31s)



[tags don't care we view and create mmm](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m34s)



[sure sounds good make me a storage](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m39s)



[account I think this is where we're just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m41s)



[gonna have we're gonna point the update](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m51s)



[location at this and ultimately I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m56s)



[I want to have the pipeline just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h00m59s)



[automatically publish this guy out I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h01m02s)

[can enumerate blobs the container](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h01m41s)



[writing on its request but can own](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h01m42s)



[containers within this storage account I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h01m45s)

[a minute okay back down here back over](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h02m35s)



[here let's see continuous integration](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h02m38s)



[continuous deployment so let's start](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h02m41s)



[with the integration piece so I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h02m46s)



[we're gonna go with from now we're just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h02m49s)

[nougat nougat II stuff let's do it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m23s)



[sometime after nougat but before build I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m27s)



[guess so this is not going to be the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m32s)



[correct path so we need to find the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m36s)



[appropriate path and I think the digit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m45s)



[did default working directory is where](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h03m49s)

[version number okay there's that let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h04m38s)



[see msbuild package the app okie so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h04m44s)



[let's come over here we're not going to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h04m50s)

[looking for something that looks like](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m00s)



[it's targeting an output directory](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m01s)



[preferably with an app X name just keep](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m04s)



[going down here real quick and seen but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m08s)



[I'm not thinking that one that we found](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m10s)



[is probably what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m15s)



[and I am somewhat wondering if we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m23s)



[actually need to set any of these things](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m26s)



[because some of these properties may get](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m28s)



[set for us so what we might do here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m30s)



[let's do this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m32s)



[let's just take just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m34s)



[turn you off right because you clearly](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m46s)



[don't need to be set FX signing and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m50s)



[naval let's look at that one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m53s)



[to do so back up here a back signing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h22m55s)



[enabled uh did effects package signing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m01s)



[enabled true so this guy here actually](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m11s)



[fed in the signing but when they did it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m13s)



[on the command line they signed it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m18s)



[retroactively Lee how did they get the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m20s)



[key](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m30s)



[now I'm curious if my certain key is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m40s)



[somehow in here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m45s)



[I suppose I should actually look at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m54s)



[exactly what it is because it's the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m55s)



[problem when you don't know your own](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h23m58s)



[your own cert let's see what what are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m00s)



[you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m12s)



[him](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m15s)



[just in case I see it it'd be nice to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m17s)



[know the first few characters to be](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m20s)



[hunting for do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m21s)



[wait a minute really and I seriously](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m33s)



[just do that again](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m38s)



[well hold the phone there we might be](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m41s)



[going and cycling that key real quick is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m44s)



[that the actual key yeah it is it is so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m50s)



[let's go regen that key okay carrying on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h24m56s)



[getting really good at regenerating](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m02s)



[these keys I am wondering if I just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m04s)



[broke hmm my subtitles keep working even](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m10s)



[after I regen that key little surprised](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m17s)



[at that not really sure how that's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m21s)



[working because I thought it was using](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m25s)



[the same key it must be using key to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m26s)



[instead of key one okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m28s)



[carrying on then did okay well I don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m30s)



[see anything so I don't I don't quite](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m40s)



[understand how that's gonna work so I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m45s)



[think we probably leave signing turned](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m49s)



[off and do the same retroactively](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m51s)



[signing like what they did because if we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m53s)



[leave it on I don't see how this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m55s)



[gonna work okay so there's that where](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h25m58s)



[did this go okay so they did download](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m05s)



[secure file certificate pfx and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m08s)



[let's see P secret so this guy is gonna](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m22s)



[need to become a variable because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m28s)



[there's no way we're just gonna drop](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m30s)



[that guy right in right there right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m32s)



[let's see and I think published artifact](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m34s)



[drop is implied but maybe not so let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m38s)



[just grab grab all of these go back over](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m42s)



[here to do paste alright so we've got](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m48s)



[that download secure file script and I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m52s)



[don't I'm fairly confident we don't have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h26m57s)



[to a fairly confident sign tool exists](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m00s)



[on the path on these build agents](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m05s)



[I'm fairly confident of that in fact so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m15s)



[we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m17s)



[and if it's not we're gonna know real](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m18s)



[fast okay so we need a secure file and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m20s)



[how about a cert password right so we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m25s)



[gonna need certificate pfx and the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m36s)



[password for it and I think I want to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m41s)



[rename this a non packaged app I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m44s)



[is okay for now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m49s)



[did Messiah desktop app kind of curious](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h27m52s)



[as to how build artifacts staging](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m02s)



[directory Oh was that one previously](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m07s)



[dumping it in there was that how it was](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m11s)



[going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m14s)



[hahahaha we are going to just omit this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m17s)



[then for the moment and we will omit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m26s)



[this for the moment and just see if this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m34s)



[works right because I'm curious to just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m37s)



[look at the output of this and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m39s)



[we'll deal with signing it so step one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m41s)



[no pending changes great save save and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m46s)



[then we will go over and take a look on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m50s)



[our pipeline and see what's happening oh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m53s)



[that's probably a bad sign so just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m55s)



[adding the set of package caused us to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h28m58s)



[fail stop moving around](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m00s)

[core stuff got it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m26s)



[okay well we can get that real quick I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m28s)



[think I actually have a copy of this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m32s)



[because I believe we're doing this on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m36s)



[the material design project so let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m39s)



[take a quick look at my pipeline the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m42s)



[animal here use net core version boom](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m46s)



[this guy so we are almost assuredly](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h29m55s)



[going to air out and fail again](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m01s)



[specifically when it gets down to here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m04s)



[so we're just going to cancel this build](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m06s)



[because I want to make the change and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m08s)



[then we'll kick it back off so this guy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m11s)



[here edit because we want to grab so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m14s)



[right after nougat install we'll do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m19s)



[dotnet dotnet core version and just for](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m23s)



[consistency we'll do this and back over](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m28s)



[here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m35s)



[and I want the 3-1 release please commit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m39s)



[directly in okay now we'll let this guy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m46s)



[go because in theory this guy now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m49s)



[properly downloads dotnet core three one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h30m53s)



[and we'll see what this guy goes I'm](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m04s)



[very interested to see well so you know](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m06s)



[what we could do let's just start with](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m12s)



[this pole okay if we go back here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m16s)



[solution Explorer as your pipelines we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m21s)



[can test this right so we can sort of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m24s)



[get ourselves into the right situation](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m29s)



[and verify oh this isn't gonna work](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m31s)



[bah humbug bah humbug](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m35s)



[let's just keep canceling just keep](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m42s)



[canceling just keep cancelling and back](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m48s)



[see up a level edit because our project](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h31m54s)



[file nope not that one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m01s)



[let's go up a level is this guy so he's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m03s)



[going to need to be pointed at there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m11s)



[there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m18s)



[to see because this is just an msbuild](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m22s)



[one right so let's actually do let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m29s)



[actually just do this so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m36s)



[ding-ding-ding-ding](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m40s)



[I am wondering if I should change the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m51s)



[target now we'll just let it go because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h32m54s)



[I'm noticing this guy is not actually](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m00s)



[changing the target which means we could](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m02s)



[probably even do this as part of this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m08s)



[build up here right because this is just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m10s)



[asking for solution build configuration](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m14s)



[passing these things aside from output](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m18s)



[path shouldn't affect the other projects](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m21s)



[well because this might end up actually](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m24s)



[doing a double compile so we'll just let](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m26s)



[that guy go for a minute and we're going](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m32s)



[to get a get](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m34s)



[so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m43s)



[wait a minute why am I not use my cool](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m48s)



[terminal that's right it doesn't I don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m50s)



[have it set up with my cool theme yet so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m53s)



[we're gonna go with this let's see so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m55s)



[this guy here - we want to do the same](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h33m59s)



[thing that this guy is going to do whole](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m06s)



[latest please so he's going to target](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m12s)



[this so first of all I guess my first](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m16s)



[question is I must build on my path No](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m21s)



[so I'm gonna need the developer command](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m27s)



[prompt well](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m28s)



[CD colon slash dev that guy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m35s)



[so build alright because that's what I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m49s)



[believe this guy got kicked off with](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m55s)



[it's almost gonna be quicker to just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h34m59s)



[wait for powershell exited with exit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m01s)



[code one well that's not a good sign](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m05s)



[I cannot convert argument name to type](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m11s)



[element](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m18s)



[Eck's name apparently we need to start](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m25s)



[with something a little simpler the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m29s)



[versioning of this well in the interest](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m32s)



[of simplicity let's let's do this let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m37s)



[abandon the versioning because all this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m39s)



[powershell script is designed to do is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m41s)



[change the why would this fail](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m44s)



[I'm not sure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h35m57s)



[because all that's designed to do is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m01s)



[update the version and right now we just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m03s)



[need the thing to actually create an](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m04s)



[installer for us that's the goal at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m07s)



[least](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m09s)



[okay so developer command prompt and I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m11s)



[really want to see just what the build](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m16s)



[commands gonna look like and I can](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m20s)



[probably go back to here right let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m21s)



[because this guy here kicks off what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m26s)



[let's see so it does msbuild](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m32s)



[pointed at the solution sets up a logger](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m36s)



[etc etc etc right so I should be able to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m39s)



[just do msbuild pointed at my project](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m42s)



[where is the should be something about](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m47s)



[the x64 in here somewhere there it is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m53s)



[okay so I really want to just grab all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h36m58s)



[of you and then modify you look oh come](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h37m01s)

[have it at this path](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h37m48s)



[I'm not gonna care about any of these so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h37m57s)



[all that goes away platform x64](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m00s)

[of those switches and then inside of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m11s)



[here we're also specifying these values](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m14s)



[all right and there's nothing there's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m19s)



[nothing fancy about any of those so it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m22s)



[looks so our total invocations gonna](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m24s)



[look something akin to this so copy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m26s)



[paste okay that was a nice quick and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m34s)



[dirty fail let's see it wants dotnet SDK](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m39s)



[3.1 wait dotnet what do I have installed](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h38m50s)



[Kay sure that the restore has run you've](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m01s)



[included in the blah blah blah when x64](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m09s)



[and your runtime identifiers see this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m15s)



[why things get confusing okay so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m18s)



[see did this guy specify runtime](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m31s)



[identifiers on the command line is that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m35s)



[how that got in someone somewhere](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m37s)



[figured this did something different and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m39s)



[this is what's why I'm somewhat hoping](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m42s)



[to be able to figure out what this is uh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m44s)



[run dependencies runtime identifiers](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h39m51s)



[this guy literally just passed](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m00s)



[everything Wow](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m03s)



[okay while we can keep going let's turn](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m07s)

[Wow](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m23s)



[so it turned on bloody everything let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m24s)



[see win ten arm when ten arm äôt no no](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m29s)



[no no yes yes you're fine](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m34s)



[no so see copy and back over here paste](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m46s)



[enter](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h40m57s)



[I'm wondering if we need to do the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m12s)



[default target build target](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m16s)



[I am configure why would this not](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m24s)



[this should have the reefs okay and sure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m30s)



[the restore has run and you've included](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m33s)



[dotnet core app and the target](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m35s)



[frameworks for your project](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m37s)



[you see yeah that's there let's just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m39s)



[jump back here bill failed somewhat](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m47s)



[expectedly](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m51s)



[but let's look at exactly why it failed](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m51s)



[the s build what's the air](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h41m55s)



[oh good](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m08s)



[sure that the rooster is running you've](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m13s)



[included okay well it's at least failing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m15s)



[locally the same way it's failing up on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m21s)



[the server so that's that's convenient](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m22s)



[so we need to solve this this it's a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m24s)



[file you know let's take a look at this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m30s)



[because I feel like this is one of those](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m36s)



[cases where I've bumped into this before](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m38s)



[and I don't think it's the global JSON](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m39s)



[stuff uh let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m42s)



[this sounds remarkably familiar hey Nate](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m47s)



[McMaster bin log that's run time which](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h42m50s)



[is done here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m03s)



[did you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m14s)



[so this guy ended up being a change that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m27s)



[they pushed through see sure proper it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m29s)



[is set what exactly did you change ah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m36s)



[let's see run time identifier so I guess](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m42s)



[the first question is how was that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m49s)



[specified here so run time a dent](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m51s)



[if fires ident if is did I type of this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h43m54s)



[guy run time identifier x' it sure looks](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m03s)



[like that's correct okay and sure you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m10s)



[have included dotnet core app and the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m16s)



[target frameworks for your project](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m19s)



[so just to be clear I can build right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m27s)



[just wondering if maybe one of the other](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m35s)



[if maybe the mainstream subtitles](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m37s)



[project hadn't been built yet and so it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m40s)



[was failing perhaps](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m42s)



[so let's go and look at this stream](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m52s)



[subtitles object file and let's just see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m54s)



[what's in it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m58s)



[because I don't see my book let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h44m59s)



[open let's go please](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m05s)



[Oh net core apps three oh not three one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m08s)



[is that my problem](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m17s)



[no that is not it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m21s)



[let's continue the search](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m24s)



[oh this is material design so they're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m29s)



[not that one not that one not that one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m35s)



[not that one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m38s)



[so let's there's my error message again](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m39s)



[does not have a target for net core at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m44s)



[version 3 one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m48s)



[when X 64 wondering if this guy needs a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h45m57s)



[runtime identifier set for example](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m02s)



[runtime ID into fires we'll just put the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m09s)



[same thing in here well let's do this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m15s)



[let's go singular we don't need both and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m23s)



[then let's rebuild this guy and see what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m29s)



[that does to our project asset JSON](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m35s)



[ah-ha-ha-ha-ha net core app mmm okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m43s)



[that's looking more promising got it so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m47s)



[this is the one without the runtime](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m56s)



[identifier this is the one with needs it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h46m57s)



[for that K okay so I so let's see here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m00s)



[I'm just gonna turn that one off for the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m08s)



[moment and it still fails but let's edit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m10s)



[our command here do not have that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m14s)



[let's see stream subtitles project does](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m21s)



[not have a target for I'm pretty sure I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m25s)



[just saw a target targets so what are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m28s)



[you saying you don't have a target for](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m32s)



[net core app version 3 1 win 10 x64](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m34s)



[ahaha](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m45s)



[let's see here so this is being said it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m49s)



[went 10 I don't know what the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m54s)



[appropriate one is so let's do that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h47m58s)



[I don't need you anymore yeah no thanks](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m02s)



[thanks thanks for asking so what are you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m05s)



[I think we're gonna leave this here but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m16s)



[I'm gonna change this one to win 64](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m18s)



[right and we're gonna build this might](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m20s)



[be the subtle difference because those](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m23s)



[two msbuild commands out on the azure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m26s)



[pipeline the first one targets the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m28s)



[solution file this guy here whereas the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m32s)



[second one is targeting the app](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m36s)



[installer package again I think we might](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m38s)



[be able to get away just passing these](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m40s)



[parameters to all of them but we're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m41s)



[gonna find out okay so if we do this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m43s)



[that's looking a lot better](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h48m55s)



[boom](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m00s)



[okay so the problem that I still have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m03s)



[with this is this generated in MSI X but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m06s)



[I also told it to generate an MSI X but](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m10s)



[that is different than what I got over](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m14s)



[here which is an MSI X bundle the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m15s)



[question is what is the difference just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m22s)



[to 90 to 80 so let's go back over here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m26s)



[and see so if we jump up and the package](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m29s)



[is I think we put it in Bend no non](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m33s)



[package tab](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m38s)



[I think do you happen to have built me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m49s)



[to do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h49m57s)



[for bundle what is in for bundle effects](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m07s)



[manifest okay so this guy built this out](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m11s)



[we're gonna leave it for now and just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m14s)



[trust that this is right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m17s)



[but I think that that at least gets that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m18s)



[much working okay so let's let's figure](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m21s)



[this ugly guy out alright because this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m25s)



[is clearly not working so no let's do a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m29s)



[new item PowerShell paste and to do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m41s)



[we're just going to open you over here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m56s)



[so let's see jump up](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h50m59s)



[save still have no idea uncommon okay I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m06s)



[must not have the power shell tools](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m13s)



[installed on my Visual Studio yet that's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m15s)



[fine we can do it in code okay so this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m18s)



[guy is expected to run from the root so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m21s)



[we're just gonna change off a couple of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m23s)



[these here and make some sweeping](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m25s)



[assumptions about how this is gonna work](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m28s)



[we're gonna change these variables out](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m30s)



[because we know these will get swapped](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m33s)



[later and just for fun we'll put a nine](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m34s)



[there okay so in theory this is expected](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m42s)



[to work right that's the theory part of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m44s)



[me wonders if this is going to be oh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m52s)



[this is not you need a PowerShell window](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h51m54s)



[let's see what is it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m02s)



[I guess I can just copy and paste this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m07s)



[Jim](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m09s)



[okay so let's do could not find part of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m14s)



[the path okay so let's do this because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m24s)



[the actual code is going to have the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m37s)



[variable at the front so we're just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m40s)



[going to slap it in okay so this is the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m41s)



[same failure so cannot](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h52m50s)



[see can I cover an argument name with](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m02s)



[value type for element just something](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m08s)



[like I believe X names take in a I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m14s)



[it I think this class has like a full](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m20s)



[name property on it or its base class](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m22s)



[does let's look real quick I think it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m24s)



[just missing missing that lets see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m29s)



[properties](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m40s)



[it's the local unqualified part of the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m46s)



[name](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m49s)



[I think you can do this though right I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h53m58s)

[see this should be null](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m13s)



[I suppose we should actually validate](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m17s)



[real quick that that thing actually](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m20s)



[changed the the manifest let's see open](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m22s)



[packaging](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m33s)



[let's have it let's have it set values](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m39s)



[that we can actually see here so one two](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m42s)



[three all right save close and rerun the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h54m46s)

[didn't you literally just work a moment](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m05s)



[ago I do undo undo undo](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m07s)



[oh because it's got set yeah haha](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m22s)



[this guy here okay so let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m32s)



[well for starters let's let's first](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m35s)



[confirm this right make sure that that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m37s)



[actually set something useful so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m40s)



[solution Explorer might have to submit a](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m43s)



[pull request on that on those Doc's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m47s)



[because that is clearly an error and see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m51s)



[packaging one two three](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m56s)



[okay perfect oh so our PowerShell now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h55m58s)



[works therefore the versioning I like](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m01s)



[the weird output I'm trying to one of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m04s)



[these lines I thought this was I'll have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m06s)



[to go and find it I've done some other](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m10s)



[code is that this one here that's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m12s)



[causing that one of these guys is I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m17s)



[think it's probably that one there we go](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m22s)



[okay so this is the magical script we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m25s)



[want okay so back into here back in here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m28s)



[let's let's go through and clean this up](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m34s)



[really you don't know how to undo that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m38s)



[huh nope](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m42s)



[let's see multi cursor support there we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m45s)



[go well so that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m49s)



[paced up up up double double triple and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h56m55s)



[then whack all the way down to here okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m03s)



[so actually not quite what I wanted](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m10s)



[because I wanted this string here not my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m14s)



[hard coded version I want that and then](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m19s)



[I want the path here to be this go with](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m25s)



[the forward slash to be consistent](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m37s)



[nothing it's gonna make a difference in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m38s)



[this case there okay so something akin](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m41s)



[to that that fixes that that fixes that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m46s)



[this guy should build now and the fix](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m55s)



[for it was to change to the CS prod so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h57m59s)



[everything's local oh dear heavens what](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m01s)



[have we done so we are going to delete](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m03s)



[this file because we don't need it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m08s)



[anymore which means we should probably](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m10s)



[have done it from here so that it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m13s)



[updates the solution file accordingly](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m14s)



[okay let's figure out what the heck so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m16s)



[non packaged apps discard all you know](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m22s)



[we don't want that discard all we don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m28s)



[want that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m32s)



[okay so there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m33s)



[sure I guess and better stage all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m43s)



[changes 17 fix to build mess IX commit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h58m51s)



[push](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m00s)



[okay so we'll see see how that does real](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m06s)



[quick](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m12s)

[that window you get that windows to stop](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m14s)



[showing my keys okay Oh interesting did](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m18s)



[my subtitles actually cut out they](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m25s)



[appear to have done so that is a very](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m29s)



[convenient thing probably means I need](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m32s)



[to restart them here in a moment let me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m38s)



[do that real quick just grab this let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m40s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m50s)



[grab me my keys I'm gonna have I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m52s)



[have my local copy use a different key](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m56s)



[just so I stop breaking myself every](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=01h59m59s)



[time I go to run it okay so you just](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m03s)



[really will just have to relaunch you](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m12s)



[come here come here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m15s)



[and let's see here underneath my temp](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m18s)



[stuff underneath my launch stuff test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m22s)



[test test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m28s)



[there we go subtitles are back huzzah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m29s)



[yeah that's pretty good okay let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m39s)



[what the pipeline is doing let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m42s)



[don't need you don't need you don't need](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m46s)



[you back over to your pipelines](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m49s)



[pipelines latest one is churning so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m53s)



[that's a plus in the right direction](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h00m58s)



[though it hasn't gotten to the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m00s)



[interesting ones yet this is one of the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m02s)



[most obnoxious parts about doing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m08s)



[pipeline type work is you can only test](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m10s)



[so much local and then you just gotta](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m12s)



[kind of hope and pray and then push and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m16s)



[be patient push and be patient which is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m20s)



[why we should look at figuring out the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m22s)



[the caching on this guy because I do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m26s)



[believe that there is opportunities for](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m30s)



[caching just to make them a little](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m33s)



[quicker because usually some of the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m38s)



[slowest parts are the the checkout](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m40s)



[there's only so much you can do about it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m42s)



[right because it's got a clone Oh](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m43s)



[build failure again what is your problem](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m46s)



[what is your problem come on show me](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m50s)



[rare ah let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h01m54s)



[official studio no certificate found](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m02s)



[with the supplied thumbprint ah okay now](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m07s)



[we're making progress so this guy is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m10s)



[attempting to sign it and no happy no no](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m15s)



[happy okay so let's figure that guy out](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m20s)



[real quick so how do we turn off your](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m24s)



[signing you're probably in here I would](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m29s)



[imagine Oh actually we can probably turn](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m33s)



[off some of these project configurations](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m37s)



[debug let's get rid of a bunch of these](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m39s)



[so we're not ever going to use any of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m43s)



[these a little surprised that all of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m45s)



[these are defined too because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m48s)



[hmm interesting all the way that doesn't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m54s)



[break anything by nuking them](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m58s)



[well no shortly okay so one of these](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h02m59s)



[should have a yeah so this guy here all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m02s)



[right so that's package certificate](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m07s)



[thumbprint I kind of just want to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m10s)



[comment it for now generate app](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m13s)



[installer file](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m19s)



[oh so we could okay so let's oh yuck](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m37s)



[yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m40s)



[yuck](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m43s)



[sometimes visual studio sometimes we do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m45s)



[not need all of these I really](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m50s)



[especially with the newer CS proj format](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m51s)



[I do not like when I see these types of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m54s)



[checks especially when they're always](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h03m58s)



[being set to the same thing just move it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m00s)



[up into the default property group and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m02s)



[be done with it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m04s)



[so that'll fix that let's go in here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m04s)



[because I think we actually set that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m07s)



[variable didn't we FX bundle always see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m09s)



[we don't need to override that we'll let](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m12s)



[the project file handling done okay so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m14s)



[that property is now set right there so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m17s)



[is there anything else that would](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m21s)



[trigger this guy to do signing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m23s)



[package certificate thumbprint turned](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m32s)



[off the to cert](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m39s)



[okay how about sign up X package signing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m45s)



[enabled well that sounds like the one we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m53s)



[wanted to turn off](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h04m56s)



[so just me here's that bouncing](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m11s)



[I think it's just me whatever we are](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m22s)



[going to turn this off to here because](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m26s)



[that shouldn't do anything okay that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m33s)



[that that that that just trying to see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m37s)



[what all of these are doing okay let's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m44s)



[give that a shot you changes packaging](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m47s)



[stuff pipeline stuff more attempts to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m52s)



[compile the oh you know what's going on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h05m59s)



[now this this failed this failed that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m10s)



[the first one not the second one where](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m13s)



[we're specifying the parameters oh okay](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m15s)



[let's let's look at let's look at](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m18s)



[combining these real quick because that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m20s)



[might actually save us a little bit](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m22s)



[headache so undo undo you know redo redo](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m24s)



[so let's go ahead and leave these guys](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m36s)



[here right so insert alright but if we](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m38s)



[go to our pipeline and grab these I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m45s)



[think we can just pass again I don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m52s)



[know this for a fact](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h06m58s)



[I think we can I think we can blindly](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m04s)



[pass the msbuild arguments copy and as](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m07s)



[long as we don't set the output path I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m12s)



[think we're fine](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m14s)



[all right I think because I think we can](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m16s)



[just do this and there's no nothing that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m18s)



[needs to because we aren't trying to act](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m22s)



[on the output of this yet oh dear](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m25s)



[heavens official studio you are you're](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m28s)



[annoying me and I think we can get away](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m32s)



[with this okay now let's try stage all](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m42s)



[changes double-check clean up clean up](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m48s)



[clean up clean up clean up Apex bundle](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m51s)



[why don't I see in addition to menu](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h07m57s)



[deletions staged that one line back over](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m02s)



[here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m11s)



[so now let's look it's gonna here this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m32s)



[guy here it's gonna leave that in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m37s)



[default property you're cool boom push](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m39s)



[let's see how that guy goes I do realize](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m45s)



[that I'm a little past the end of my](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m49s)

[here in a moment](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m52s)



[I might have to circle back around to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m54s)



[this because it does feel like something](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h08m57s)



[that shouldn't quite be this hard but I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h09m01s)

[that's the best way I can describe it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h09m42s)

[just grab this MS building vocation and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m01s)



[run it locally as well hang on why](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m03s)



[didn't that have our I must build](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m10s)



[arguments did I'm something](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m12s)



[did we huh did I not include the I don't](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m27s)

[arguments that we added am I crazy](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m35s)



[what I do something's not right](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m44s)



[I must build arguments certainly looks](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m52s)



[right let's look at it let's go here and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h11m58s)

[paste add there's another bug mmm that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m34s)



[so I'll I'll pull the diff up here this](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m45s)



[will be a little more obvious did it do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m49s)



[pull get latest so if you look at the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m52s)



[diff](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m55s)



[but important difference between msbuild](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m56s)



[args and msbuild arguments so either](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h12m59s)



[this is a typo or the the name of that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m03s)



[has changed so i will note that this is](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m07s)



[using vs build vs. msbuild so i am](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m11s)



[realizing that i'm this one was used in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m15s)



[the MS build 1 rather than the vs build](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m18s)



[so it's slightly different maybe maybe](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m21s)



[there's a subtle difference between each](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m26s)



[of these oops](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m27s)



[ok last build I really just want to see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m31s)



[one success here and get this thing to](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m34s)



[actually build it out especially since I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m36s)



[know that the command ran locally which](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m39s)



[means there's a really really good](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m41s)



[chance that it runs here I hope there's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m43s)



[a really good chance that it runs here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m46s)



[gamma come on](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h13m49s)

[come on to get restore all the stuff](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m09s)



[store all the stuff I know it's hard I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m11s)



[know you can do it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m14s)



[- so let's see here I guess that one](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m31s)



[isn't necessarily a typo I think it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m36s)



[just this guy here is the typo with the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m40s)

[does not which makes it much harder](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h14m56s)



[submit a pull request to fix it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m03s)



[mmm let's look we're no longer oh that's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m07s)



[because they switch ah ha ha got it got](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m12s)



[it so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m20s)



[that's the reason that it's not there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m26s)



[anymore](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m29s)



[okay well that's really unfortunate](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m29s)



[should look and see if I can find an](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m33s)



[updated version of this somewhere it's](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m35s)



[clearly we're going backwards oh oh look](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m39s)



[at that it compiled it compiled I love](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m45s)



[it I love it I love it yeah nothing in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m49s)



[the artifacts directory which is not](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m55s)



[shocking in the least but it did compile](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h15m56s)



[and run yes or I should say compiled and](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m01s)



[ran the unit tests](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m04s)



[so same warnings this guy should have](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m05s)



[built out everything we need so what did](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m13s)



[this guy do here so copy a file from](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m23s)



[blah blah blah to temp this guy went](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m25s)



[into temp for its output](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m32s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m40s)



[so create test layout so here's the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m46s)



[other question I have this guy here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m50s)



[generate a pecs package this guy call so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m52s)



[you'll note these are the names of the](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m57s)



[targets so let's do generate FX so it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h16m59s)



[didn't actually do it](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m09s)



[so let's jump back here real quick so I](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m18s)



[believe what we can do is let's see](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m20s)



[targets gets and I think what we can do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m28s)



[here is just open logs open logs](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m33s)



[external I'll look at that](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m41s)



[this is close to what I want](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m53s)



[except for that is not quite what I want](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h17m56s)



[coppy I guess](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m10s)

[see here](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m15s)



[I think if we go here and we just do](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m21s)



[msbuild show me how do i specify targets](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m24s)



[I think it's just slash targets if I'm](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m29s)



[not mistaken](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m33s)



[there](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m41s)



[option](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m45s)



[yeah such target so I think](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m48s)



[I realized that this guy shows hyphens](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h18m57s)



[but obviously the slash is working so](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h19m02s)



[we're gonna go back up that was one of](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h19m05s)



[the first ones there and just drop it in](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h19m11s)



[to her gets plural right target singular](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h19m15s)

[hopefully because this has the output](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h20m04s)



[path set right yeah a non packaged how](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h20m10s)



[we should have cleared it first](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h20m15s)



[and did](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h20m23s)

[that difference would be but regardless](https://youtu.be/s1CBQKqG_aM?t=02h21m20s)
