[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m01s)

[decided to try something a little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m05s)

[different left a little brain teaser](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m06s)

[sitting there uh if you're watching the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m08s)

[recording of This the brain teaser was](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m10s)

[kind of simple of what is uh or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m12s)

[maybe I should go back in and check the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m15s)

[exact wording but how do you invoke a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m17s)

[static Constructor twice or under what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m19s)

[situations is a static Constructor and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m21s)

[voted twice so it was a brain teaser put](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m23s)

[forward by one of my colleagues and I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m25s)

[thought it was a good one so I figured](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h00m27s)

[posted live out onto intellitex uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m19s)

[YouTube channel uh as soon as we can](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m22s)

[actually get it appropriately cropped](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m25s)

[and deal with the recording and that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m27s)

[jazz so if you are interested that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m28s)

[recording will go there feel free to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m31s)

[subscribe they always like it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m33s)

[and all of that stuff](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m35s)

[okay answer to solution](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m37s)

[So for anybody](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m39s)

[I got a I got a ton of stuff open I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m42s)

[should check what I have open before I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m44s)

[get too carried away okay so here is the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m45s)

[here is the premise is we've got a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m48s)

[simple unit test you can see it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m51s)

[passing right now we got a nice little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m53s)

[green uh check marks and the idea is how](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m54s)

[do we invoke this uh or how do we get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h01m58s)

[ref count to two and you can see I've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m00s)

[got a a class Foo it has a static](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m03s)

[Constructor and that static Constructor](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m06s)

[is the only one that actually invokes or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m08s)

[increments this and so then the question](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m11s)

[is how do we get to two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m13s)

[the answer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m15s)

[is rather simple](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m17s)

[and it comes down to how generics work](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m19s)

[so in the case of Foo being a generic](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m22s)

[class it's static Constructor could be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m26s)

[invoked multiple times](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m28s)

[because in this case a bar is a foo of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m31s)

[int and a baz is a foo of string meaning](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m34s)

[that if you do something like this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m37s)

[you'll end up having ref count](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m39s)

[incremented twice](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m41s)

[so this is a bit of a contrived example](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m43s)

[this actually bit my colleague doing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m45s)

[stuff with unit testing and hierarchies](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m47s)

[and uh was surprised when he was getting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m49s)

[multiple instances and wasn't actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m52s)

[clear as to why so kind of a fun little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m54s)

[problem to think through if people like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m57s)

[it let me know I might put more of those](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h02m59s)

[at the beginning I was contemplating](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m01s)

[taking some of my other brain teasers](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m02s)

[that I've done and making like little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m03s)

[YouTube shorts or something out of them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m05s)

[just for fun I enjoy these types of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m07s)

[weird little problems because they're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m09s)

[entertaining and I thought they were](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m12s)

[clever](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m15s)

[so okay with that said](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m16s)

[we're gonna dive back into](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m19s)

[my pointer project](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m22s)

[so for anyone who missed it uh last week](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m24s)

[we started in on a new blazer project](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m27s)

[called uh pointer or it because you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m30s)

[can't do pointer with a little asterisk](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m34s)

[at the end](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m35s)

[yo that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m37s)

[jovial jig that's Alan right trying to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m39s)

[remember I I have trouble remembering](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m42s)

[I don't keep track of people though](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m45s)

[uh sweet yes Alan is my uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m47s)

[illustrious product owner](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m51s)

[candles are dumb](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m54s)

[uh but for anybody who wants to uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m56s)

[follow along](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h03m59s)

[this is a simple Blazer site the the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m01s)

[basic premise is uh scrum medians](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m03s)

[oftentimes the team will go through and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m07s)

[uh size out items typically using a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m09s)

[variety of processes one of which is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m13s)

[pointing poker where every member on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m15s)

[team is allowed to vote on how big a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m17s)

[particular ticket is you typically use](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m21s)

[the numbers of a Fibonacci series so one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m24s)

[two three five eight Etc](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m26s)

[um and then everybody votes and the idea](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m29s)

[is you vote before knowing what everyone](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m31s)

[else's votes are then everyone reveals](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m33s)

[then hopefully there's some discussion](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m35s)

[and team comes to agreement on what the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m37s)

[the actual size is supposed to be so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m40s)

[there's various sites that do this one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m42s)

[of which is actually called uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m44s)

[pointeenpoker.com](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m48s)

[and so this is sort of the the site that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m49s)

[we're building here is sort of a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m52s)

[knockoff of this with a little bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m54s)

[I don't I don't want to say less we'll](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m56s)

[say a streamlined experience and dark](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h04m59s)

[theme because Dark theme is important](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m02s)

[um so that's effectively what we were](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m07s)

[building last time we started down on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m09s)

[that process but I've made a little bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m12s)

[of progress on it since then and so I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m15s)

[figured I would update on where we're at](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m17s)

[here let's let's just look at the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m19s)

[running site](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m20s)

[um for anybody interested you can go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m22s)

[here if you've loaded the site before](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m24s)

[you may want to make sure that you uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m26s)

[blow away your cache control F5](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m28s)

[something something something to make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m31s)

[sure that you get in but you can go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m33s)

[ahead and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m35s)

[if anybody wants to dive in there's the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m37s)

[there's the room link](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m39s)

[um the first one in gets to be the the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m41s)

[facilitator is the the role of the first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m43s)

[one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m46s)

[um second person in and I'll just drop](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m47s)

[one to the side so that I have two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m49s)

[you can see second user in there's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m54s)

[another user and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m55s)

[where I think we're gonna go first is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m58s)

[we're gonna actually like let people](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h05m59s)

[pick their own votes rather than they're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m01s)

[just being a random vote because right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m03s)

[now votes are submitted and they go back](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m04s)

[and forth and you can see they're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m06s)

[updating fairly quickly so we've got](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m07s)

[signalr on the back end which we'll look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m09s)

[at in just in a second to do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m12s)

[communication and then it also handles](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m13s)

[users dropping that kind of thing we'll](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m15s)

[want to at some point like allow users](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m18s)

[to reconnect and whatever in case they](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m20s)

[accidentally close their browser tab](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m22s)

[because it would be really nice if when](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m23s)

[I do this if I could come back and and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m25s)

[pick up as the same user that I was](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m27s)

[before so none of that's done but I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m29s)

[think we're going to start with the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m31s)

[voting buttons it's probably a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m32s)

[reasonable spot so that we can pick it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m34s)

[and then maybe start building out a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m36s)

[little bit cleaner UI so that this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m37s)

[doesn't look like crap and right now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m39s)

[there is this show votes toggle and it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m41s)

[is toggling a Boolean on the back end of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m43s)

[the state it's just that nothing's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m46s)

[respecting that state because ideally](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m47s)

[the votes would not be shown until the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m49s)

[facilitator decides yes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m52s)

[let us show the votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m54s)

[and then and then we go from there so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m56s)

[that that's where we're at at the moment](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h06m59s)

[but I think doing uh actual voting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m00s)

[buttons is probably where we want to go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m04s)

[so I think there's yeah this one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m06s)

[dibs mine](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m09s)

[Okay so self-assigned](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m11s)

[and away we go so there uh and if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m14s)

[anybody is actually interested in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m19s)

[playing along](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m20s)

[um I am happy to take pull requests on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m21s)

[this project this is somewhat a project](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m24s)

[a a labor of love because I'm wanting to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m26s)

[learn some of this stuff and because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m28s)

[Alan needs it so we both win it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m30s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m32s)

[um let's go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m34s)

[um so the the actual requirements for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m38s)

[the MVP are on the Milestone themselves](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m40s)

[um a lot of the issues uh directly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m43s)

[correlate to this but some of them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m46s)

[aren't well they were kind of done in a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m47s)

[rush by me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m49s)

[um and I figured we would go through and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m51s)

[do this so the key thing to know for the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m53s)

[Voting is for MVP we want a series like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h07m55s)

[this we want to let somebody abstain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m00s)

[question mark](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m01s)

[Ellen why do we have zero is can there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m03s)

[ever be a zero did you mean to have zero](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m06s)

[or do you really just want abstain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m09s)

[question mark](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m10s)

[and then numbers](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m12s)

[like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m15s)

[we could have a zero so be it the the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m18s)

[key thing to note is future enhancements](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m21s)

[might let those be customizable or sheet](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m22s)

[size I can't explain why but yes I hate](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m25s)

[it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m27s)

[well as the product owner you it is your](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m28s)

[prerogative to decide so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m31s)

[we're gonna build this out but I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m35s)

[the list of available options we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m37s)

[going to make data driven](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m39s)

[um just knowing that future enhancements](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m41s)

[might want to let these be customizables](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m43s)

[t-shirt sizes or whatever we aren't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m45s)

[going to build that now but we'll make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m48s)

[it data driven with the idea that that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m49s)

[could be something configurable in the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m51s)

[future](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m53s)

[so let's take a look at what is driving](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m54s)

[this thing on the back side](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m57s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h08m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m00s)

[on the server side we created a a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m01s)

[signalr hub and there's not a lot to to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m05s)

[adding in a a signalr hub into a project](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m08s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m11s)

[so a couple key things to note uh you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m12s)

[set up the or one assuming you've got](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m16s)

[the appropriate nuget package for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m19s)

[signalr already referenced add add](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m20s)

[signalr here with any configurable](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m23s)

[options most of this is probably not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m25s)

[overly relevant for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m27s)

[um I just wanted to set a few of the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m31s)

[options a lot of times you can take the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m33s)

[defaults you don't necessarily need to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m35s)

[add Json or all of that kind of jazz but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m37s)

[it does make some things a little bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m40s)

[nicer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m41s)

[the other thing that you have to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m42s)

[after registering it with di is actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m46s)

[called app map Hub and give it a an](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m48s)

[endpoint so that it knows where it needs](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m51s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m52s)

[and I just basically did Slash room Hub](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m53s)

[because it was simple and easy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h09m56s)

[that then means that over on the client](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m00s)

[side so this is the the wasm that gets](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m02s)

[downloaded and executed on the browser](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m05s)

[we then have this room Hub connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m08s)

[and just for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m10s)

[sharing that guy lives down here in this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m13s)

[vicinity I also slapped an interface in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m16s)

[front of it just because there's a bunch](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m19s)

[of unit tests and I wanted to be able to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m21s)

[unit test out the the connection without](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m23s)

[it being a real one so simple enough](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m27s)

[this thing connects you'll note it does](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m30s)

[need a URL but that comes in via the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m35s)

[um this guy here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m39s)

[so you'll note the the DI or the client](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m40s)

[project when it's registering up the the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m44s)

[room Hub connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m47s)

[and in this case Singleton](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m48s)

[um I believe is what we want because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m51s)

[this is executed as a Singleton](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m52s)

[inside the browser so this is Singleton](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m55s)

[per client](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h10m58s)

[uh creates a new room connection goes to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m00s)

[the navigation manager to get the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m03s)

[um the server's URI and then makes uh an](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m06s)

[absolute URI with Slash room Hub uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m09s)

[can't do name up here because this is in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m12s)

[the client project not the server so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m14s)

[hard-coded string but yeah whatever but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m16s)

[that passes in the the room URI](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m19s)

[and I'm actually noticing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m22s)

[I'm wondering because we we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m25s)

[intentionally two stringing it does this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m26s)

[need to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m28s)

[you know what we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m30s)

[I just decided I don't like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m32s)

[when in when possible I prefer to have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m36s)

[your eyes be Uris this is what happens](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m39s)

[when I copy copy code](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m42s)

[clean that up there and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m46s)

[this guy if he actually wants it yeah so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m49s)

[he'll take it he'll take a URI directly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m53s)

[so we don't even need to change anything](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m55s)

[else beautiful beautiful beautiful](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m56s)

[uh but the this connection then is what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h11m59s)

[is responsible for connecting back and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m02s)

[forth to the signalr hub](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m04s)

[so that's it gets built up it registers](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m06s)

[up for a room update method so this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m09s)

[what's registering the communication](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m13s)

[back and forth](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m15s)

[um we're gonna ignore some of the open](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m17s)

[and close stuff](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m19s)

[um the connection itself defines a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m21s)

[couple methods these are just very small](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m23s)

[forwarding methods that actually go to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m26s)

[the underlying connection to send uh to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m28s)

[make calls out the door so effectively](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m30s)

[all this does is give you a nice](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m33s)

[strongly typed method for invoking on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m34s)

[the Hub connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m37s)

[because the the underlying Hub](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m38s)

[connection that goes out just gives you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m41s)

[an invoke async with a method name](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m43s)

[arguments that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m46s)

[um and in our case we don't want to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m49s)

[think about that we want to strongly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m51s)

[type signature that way if we change](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m53s)

[something in the hub the only place it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m55s)

[needs to change is in this connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m56s)

[and then everything else should be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m58s)

[compile errors from there on out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h12m59s)

[on the server side](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m02s)

[boom those same methods are defined here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m07s)

[so for example when a client connects](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m10s)

[and they want to join a room there's the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m12s)

[room ID there's the user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m14s)

[um the the thing to note is this room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m17s)

[Hub is registered in di in scoped](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m19s)

[context which means if you try to keep](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m22s)

[track of all of your uh your backing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m25s)

[data like keeping track of what rooms](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m28s)

[you have what users are in what rooms](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m30s)

[that's not going to work here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m32s)

[um so instead we put it behind this room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m35s)

[manager and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m39s)

[I slapped an interface there partly for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m41s)

[testing partly because I think I'm going](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m43s)

[to eventually want to change out the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m45s)

[data store of where this data lives even](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m46s)

[though it doesn't need to live for long](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m48s)

[periods of time this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m49s)

[in-memory implementation but I can](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m52s)

[easily see getting something a little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m54s)

[more consistent just because in the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m56s)

[event of any sort of cycling deployments](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h13m59s)

[the in memory state is kind of volatile](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m02s)

[and could get cleared and people could](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m05s)

[lose their current state if we do a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m06s)

[deployment while people are using it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m08s)

[yada yada that would be a bad experience](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m10s)

[blah blah blah maybe back it with a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m11s)

[redis or something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m13s)

[um but for now in memory](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m16s)

[um I won't bore you with most of this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m18s)

[this is basically a Singleton with some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m20s)

[concurrent dictionaries to do a bunch of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m23s)

[work one of which contains a semaphore](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m25s)

[slim just for doing some locking to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m28s)

[maintain concurrency](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m30s)

[but this handles toggling say the show](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m32s)

[votes Boolean on the back end data store](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m36s)

[so the underlying uh object that's being](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m38s)

[passed back and forth is this room state](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m42s)

[uh the room state has a set of users it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m44s)

[has an ID and it has a set for votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m47s)

[shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m50s)

[and then a user has a vote has a role](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m50s)

[the role is down here right now we have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m54s)

[facilitator team member and observer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m56s)

[these are just some hard-coded built-in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h14m58s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m00s)

[um for no other reason other than make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m02s)

[it simple the important thing here is we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m04s)

[don't actually care to enforce like high](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m06s)

[security](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m11s)

[you'll note people aren't actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m12s)

[required to log in users are ultimately](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m13s)

[going to be able to specify what name](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m16s)

[they want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m17s)

[um this isn't really meant to to lock it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m19s)

[down and users are going to be allowed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m21s)

[to change between roles so it's not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m23s)

[something that we really need to lock](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m25s)

[down](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m26s)

[um it's really just going to be a UI](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m28s)

[change as far as what you get access to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m29s)

[it's not necessarily a lot of security](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m32s)

[so room Hub connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m35s)

[uh let's see backing data store this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m38s)

[thing's responsible for keeping track of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m40s)

[all of the rooms what users are in what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m42s)

[rooms what signal our connections map to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m44s)

[which users uh which connections are in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m47s)

[which rooms just for some quick lookups](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m50s)

[and all of that jazz so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m52s)

[builds all of those dictionaries up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m55s)

[everything goes great and everyone's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h15m57s)

[happy and away we go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m00s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m02s)

[yeah so that's that's what we got so far](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m04s)

[so I think what we're going to do for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m06s)

[the voting buttons is I think what we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m08s)

[going to do is just slap on a collection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m11s)

[here in our state as far as what the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m14s)

[the valid voting buttons are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m18s)

[because if this is ever configurable](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m21s)

[later we want to be able to pass that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m23s)

[information down to all of the users so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m25s)

[this feels like the right place so we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m29s)

[going to do it there uh uh let's see and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m31s)

[copilot has been on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m34s)

[absolute point with this project like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m37s)

[insanely good in this case no copilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m40s)

[you're wrong go away you're drunk uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m43s)

[let's see uh how about](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m45s)

[vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m49s)

[uh options](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m51s)

[uh sure we'll do a get init](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m55s)

[in it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h16m58s)

[and then copilot fill in all the right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m00s)

[values](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m02s)

[that's not the right values copilot I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m04s)

[had I had more faith in you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m06s)

[uh so we're just gonna do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m08s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m12s)

[and then let's see so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m14s)

[uh abstain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m20s)

[question mark](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m23s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m27s)

[come on copilot I'm really rooting for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m30s)

[you figure out the series figure out the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m32s)

[series](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m33s)

[what's the obvious conclusion co-pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m35s)

[one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m38s)

[two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m41s)

[is this the order that they're presented](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m43s)

[uh good question uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m45s)

[uh probably what order would you like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m48s)

[them presented in do you want these](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m50s)

[other ones at the end](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m51s)

[because we could certainly do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m54s)

[we'll cut them not delete them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m57s)

[okay we will put them at the end uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h17m59s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m02s)

[hey go pilot stop helping me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m03s)

[either do the right thing or get out of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m05s)

[the way](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m07s)

[five](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m08s)

[uh eight and I'm trying to remember what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m10s)

[we went up to 13](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m12s)

[and I think in this case we jump this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m16s)

[where this is where people deviate on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m18s)

[their their series](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m20s)

[uh I'm just gonna copy these](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m22s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m28s)

[do that do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m37s)

[uh technically 21 but most use 20. yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m42s)

[and I don't know if I necessarily really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m45s)

[even care that much let's see and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m48s)

[those two go there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m50s)

[and we may throw in some other stuff at](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m55s)

[some point like we may want to make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m56s)

[these things fancier but for now we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h18m58s)

[doing the simplest thing possible and a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m01s)

[straight up string array is the simplest](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m03s)

[thing possible](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m05s)

[uh as long as mostly fibonacci-ish yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m06s)

[this will make the mathematician people](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m10s)

[happy oh I did 20 and 21. we probably](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m12s)

[don't want both of those](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m15s)

[okay so that will get that let's go up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m17s)

[to our room page](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m21s)

[and now we want to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m24s)

[do this so I think one of the things I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m28s)

[going to add while I'm in here is just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m30s)

[checking the user's role](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m33s)

[uh uh let's see view model](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m35s)

[uh is team member we're gonna add that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m40s)

[real quick because we're only gonna have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m44s)

[the submit vote buttons if they're a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m46s)

[team member so let's open the view model](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m51s)

[kind of wondering if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h19m55s)

[because I did this is facilitator and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m00s)

[I'm wondering if I should actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m02s)

[do something different](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m07s)

[because this will the only way this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m12s)

[ever going to trigger is based on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m14s)

[current user role](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m16s)

[yeah I think what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m19s)

[so for for people who missed the last](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m22s)

[one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m24s)

[um this uh base level object is watching](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m25s)

[for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m31s)

[the the property changes and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m33s)

[appropriately notifying](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m36s)

[so this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m39s)

[this is what's triggering those updates](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m43s)

[every pass through here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m46s)

[is when property changed is firing on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m48s)

[these things it's triggering it so as](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m51s)

[long as we have one property changed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m53s)

[it's gonna trigger an entire layout and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m54s)

[I'm wondering if maybe we we cut down](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m57s)

[this is facilitator and do something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h20m59s)

[more like uh view model](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m03s)

[Uh current](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m05s)

[well it's probably rather than doing a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m07s)

[lookup every time it's probably cheaper](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m10s)

[to just do a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m18s)

[it's probably cheaper to just notify and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m20s)

[do computed properties on the on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m22s)

[back side I I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m29s)

[that's probably just fine like this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m32s)

[performance of this isn't going to be a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m34s)

[big deal](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m36s)

[uh so let's do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m37s)

[and let's get rid of that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m40s)

[let's go is facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m43s)

[and go with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m45s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m47s)

[current](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m50s)

[user because I kind of want to just do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m51s)

[this maneuver here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m54s)

[uh let's see current user like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h21m58s)

[but then that assumes that I have a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m02s)

[private user current user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m04s)

[which we're gonna then just look up okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m08s)

[seriously co-pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m11s)

[I mean yes that's correct but you jerk](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m13s)

[okay hang on hang on if I tell you it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m17s)

[nullable can you do better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m19s)

[there thank you yes excellent good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m22s)

[co-pilot carry on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m25s)

[I mean seriously this is just wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m28s)

[absolute](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m32s)

[absolutely wrong okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m34s)

[well thank you co-pilot you've been a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m36s)

[wonderful wonderful Health tonight](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m41s)

[I uh let's see it's team member roll](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m43s)

[team member boom done done done done and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m48s)

[then we don't need this we don't need](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m51s)

[this and this just works](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m57s)

[we could actually probably even go make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h22m58s)

[this guy a computer property too](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m01s)

[votes shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m03s)

[gonna get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m06s)

[really really Copilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m10s)

[you're just okay okay show off](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m12s)

[absolute show-off](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m19s)

[lovely](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m20s)

[uh let's see current user ID gets set](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m23s)

[elsewhere so that works that works](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m26s)

[I'm almost wondering if we we should](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m30s)

[pass back data that tells the user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m32s)

[rather than them assuming they got to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m34s)

[keep their ID but yeah whatever that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m36s)

[that's a problem for a different day](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m38s)

[uh okay so the next thing we want to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m40s)

[give back is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m43s)

[all right so this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m46s)

[what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m51s)

[hello](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m54s)

[did I make it private or something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m57s)

[uh okay hold on hold on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h23m59s)

[I close too many things](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m02s)

[oh right so if you make your properties](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m06s)

[private you can't access them from](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m09s)

[outside](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m10s)

[so that's that's a problem](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m12s)

[you should make your properties public](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m14s)

[or use an appropriate access modifier](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m17s)

[where where needed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m20s)

[because if you don't you can't access](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m23s)

[them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m24s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m26s)

[ambiguity between votes shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m34s)

[right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m41s)

[this one we can't do like that because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m42s)

[this one ha okay right right right right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m45s)

[right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m47s)

[uh this one has to be read write because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m50s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m54s)

[gets used here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h24m56s)

[and yes async void bad bad bad bad bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m00s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m03s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m08s)

[do this do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m11s)

[rebuild and you should figure it out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m14s)

[uh identifier expected there we go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m19s)

[is team member there we are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m22s)

[okay so we're only going to give them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m25s)

[the voting buttons if they're a team](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m26s)

[member](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m28s)

[and then we just need to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m29s)

[okay copilot you're getting ahead of it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m34s)

[that is not the button we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m36s)

[implementing right now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m37s)

[show off](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m43s)

[let's see what is the what is the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m44s)

[simplest way to go about doing this I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m47s)

[want to look up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m51s)

[so my way of doing this has been and I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m52s)

[really should save this link somewhere](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m55s)

[the the bootstrap uh uh style that we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h25m58s)

[decided to go with was the solar one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m03s)

[here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m08s)

[I almost like the dark style there a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m10s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m12s)

[rather than something else](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m13s)

[somewhat tempted to do something like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m17s)

[that for it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m20s)

[yeah let's go with it let's go with that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m29s)

[that seems that seems nice](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m31s)

[so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m34s)

[for each over the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m36s)

[uh view model](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m39s)

[dot roomstate dot uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m43s)

[what did I call it load options there we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m49s)

[are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m50s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m52s)

[option in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m54s)

[okay copilot the answer is on my](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m58s)

[clipboard can you figure it out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h26m59s)

[no](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m03s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m05s)

[it's gotten bad I I've started trying to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m06s)

[like write code and see at what point](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m09s)

[copilot can actually do all of the work](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m11s)

[for me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m14s)

[okay now you're showing off Copilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m16s)

[you got the you got the class wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m22s)

[though](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m24s)

[ha see you can't replace me just yet](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m25s)

[can't replace me yet](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m29s)

[but you're getting close you're getting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m33s)

[close uh let's see so we need to change](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m36s)

[submit vote to not be a random thing and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m40s)

[actually take a parameter](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m44s)

[so that's a thing that will need to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m46s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m48s)

[uh wait](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m50s)

[did I hit the wrong I think I hit the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m56s)

[wrong button uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h27m58s)

[string vote and then we're going to get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m00s)

[rid of the random](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m03s)

[and this vote goes here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m05s)

[like this this to do dies](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m09s)

[you're doing good right there's there's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m13s)

[a few models Robert but this does not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m14s)

[look wpfe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m16s)

[uh let's see so submit vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m18s)

[there they're there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m21s)

[I think all of that works Let's test it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m35s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m39s)

[great room I need to copy this I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m43s)

[appropriately don't have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m46s)

[it's just happened at this point just go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m49s)

[along with it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m51s)

[welcome Robert](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m53s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m55s)

[great we've got two users](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h28m58s)

[I'm trying to decide if those buttons](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m02s)

[are visible enough](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m04s)

[or if they need a little more](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m06s)

[something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m09s)

[yeah I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m20s)

[I'm wondering if I should start changing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m24s)

[this layout because I'm thinking what I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m27s)

[want is the top level to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m29s)

[so we've got this kind of room thing and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m33s)

[that's whatever](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m36s)

[um but I think what I want is the top](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m38s)

[section to almost be user specific](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m40s)

[functionality so if you're the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m42s)

[facilitator you get like the show votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m44s)

[toggle and that kind of thing if you're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m46s)

[a team member you get your voting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m48s)

[buttons and then below that be the place](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m50s)

[where we list out like the users and the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m52s)

[votes and all that stuff I think that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m55s)

[actually what okay so one it works just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h29m57s)

[fine great huzzah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m00s)

[um these buttons need some spacing and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m03s)

[maybe a different style](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m05s)

[that's it just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m07s)

[it looks so pretty but it Blends in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m10s)

[what's the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m14s)

[success might not be bad or info might](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m16s)

[not be bad maybe we go with info and we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m18s)

[make a big](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m20s)

[little style them that way](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m22s)

[much as I like the dark I am](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m24s)

[okay so let's change this up here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m27s)

[so I think we're going to use this top](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m33s)

[section to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m35s)

[uh we model](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m39s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m48s)

[what is your problem](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h30m58s)

[uh okay I'm gonna go with razors lost](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m07s)

[his mind and that is perfectly valid](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m10s)

[stuff okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m13s)

[uh let's see in this case we don't need](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m18s)

[this if I don't think we've already done](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m22s)

[the appropriate check we're only doing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m25s)

[this once so it is kind of current](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m28s)

[user-ish](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m29s)

[uh what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m35s)

[something is gone horribly wrong and I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m38s)

[missing my syntax somewhere](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m41s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m43s)

[for each](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m48s)

[it's supposed to be like that is that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m51s)

[your problem you don't know that I've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m53s)

[that I'm still in a code block](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h31m55s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m03s)

[let's build and just see if it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m05s)

[complains](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m08s)

[uh this is the test](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m12s)

[uh so we're gonna just do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m15s)

[actually you know what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m18s)

[whenever you need a random number the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m20s)

[appropriate answer is always 42](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m22s)

[let's just get the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m28s)

[these should become s actual expected](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m32s)

[votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m35s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m38s)

[why is this one like this join room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m39s)

[this really should be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m42s)

[room ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m44s)

[let's see here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m48s)

[you should be room ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m50s)

[sorry cleaning up the tests really quick](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h32m57s)

[build](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m02s)

[okay let's start here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m09s)

[oh because I'm an idiot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m25s)

[uh oh boy hang on we need some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m27s)

[there we go so it turns out that if you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m29s)

[don't know C sharp you can't write C](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m32s)

[sharp](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m34s)

[okay I know the problem this is Mountain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m39s)

[Dew zero which lacks the sugar that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m41s)

[I clearly need to write code at this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m45s)

[hour](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m46s)

[don't worry](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m48s)

[replacement incoming](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m49s)

[I have that problem I'll probably see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m55s)

[sharp as well uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h33m56s)

[I completely understand](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m06s)

[probably want to style these things up a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m07s)

[little bit too because I'm thinking I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m09s)

[want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m11s)

[like these are the primary interaction](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m12s)

[buttons they'd probably be big useful](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m18s)

[and for now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m20s)

[uh let's do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m23s)

[let's just fix the it won't show them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m26s)

[while we're in here if uh viewmodel Dot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m28s)

[vote shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m39s)

[span ring](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m46s)

[I don't know why I had a non-breaking](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m52s)

[space there on the end](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m53s)

[I'm sure I'll remember in a minute uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m55s)

[okay so we'll do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h34m58s)

[we'll hide the votes until the votes are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m00s)

[shown then we'll tack them in we'll get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m02s)

[that functionality built](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m03s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m08s)

[let's see what that does](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m10s)

[probably a little cleaner](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m13s)

[I should probably set my launch settings](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m16s)

[to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m18s)

[do multiple right away](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m22s)

[okay so we're still good there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m25s)

[this one fires up okay that's not bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m28s)

[I can now vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m32s)

[kind of wish I need to do something so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m36s)

[it shows so it changes state like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m39s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m43s)

[like once the users voted this button](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m46s)

[needs to change color or something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m48s)

[like I think that something like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m51s)

[needs to happen](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m53s)

[like maybe it should go from info to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m57s)

[dark when they voted that might not look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h35m59s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m01s)

[and what do we got here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m03s)

[I'm worried those buttons would be hard](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m05s)

[to select the right one crowded together](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m07s)

[but that isn't an MVP required no well](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m09s)

[no I think we need you do have an MVP](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m12s)

[requirement of it looking nice and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m15s)

[feeling nice so we're gonna we're gonna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m17s)

[space them out here in a minute add some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m18s)

[stuff and I think we're gonna make them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m21s)

[we're gonna go for larger squares](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m22s)

[which may be hard with abstain but nah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m25s)

[yeah we'll get to that that one I'm less](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m29s)

[concerned with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m31s)

[um I'm thinking we may drop them into](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m33s)

[like a flex Grid or something so that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m34s)

[they lay out a little nicer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m38s)

[but like slapping on large button is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m41s)

[probably not a bad idea](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m43s)

[to begin with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m50s)

[uh let's see here and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m55s)

[refresh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h36m58s)

[and then we probably want to pull the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m02s)

[user's vote out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m05s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m08s)

[public string](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m10s)

[Uh current vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m13s)

[all right and we're gonna just do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m17s)

[maneuver current user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m18s)

[uh vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m22s)

[right and then I think what we'll do is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m24s)

[we're gonna change up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m27s)

[string uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m33s)

[uh class](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m39s)

[and then it will be if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m42s)

[option equals equals V model Dot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m49s)

[uh the current vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m53s)

[then this guy is going to get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m56s)

[uh let's see BTN](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h37m59s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m02s)

[otherwise](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m04s)

[BTN info something to that effect and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m07s)

[then we'll just come in here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m09s)

[and I think we can just do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m13s)

[button class like that to inject it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m17s)

[and then we'll then we'll deal with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m24s)

[layout](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m26s)

[I think then we'll want to do a size](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m27s)

[layout and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m29s)

[how that all plays together come on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m31s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m36s)

[yeah so that's a little better with them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m43s)

[bigger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m44s)

[and a little nicer with the thing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m46s)

[changing color](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m48s)

[that feels](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m50s)

[that feels a little better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m53s)

[though I'm wondering if maybe rather](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m56s)

[than dark if the green might be going](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h38m59s)

[with success might be a better option](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m02s)

[what is that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m04s)

[yeah let's let's try success](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m06s)

[um and actually I just want to see what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m10s)

[it looks like so open Dev tools](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m11s)

[uh bigger and you there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m14s)

[and I just want to know what you look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m18s)

[like if I slap well here let's do it on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m20s)

[one of the other ones actually instead](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m22s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m29s)

[what do you think Alan is the green](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m31s)

[bright enough](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m32s)

[try to imagine padding between them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m34s)

[feels a little dark to me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m40s)

[we could go we could just try let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m46s)

[let's try primary let's do primary I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m48s)

[want and see what it looks like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m50s)

[what is it not called primary what is it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m57s)

[called](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h39m59s)

[all right Mary](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m01s)

[and misspell it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m04s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m16s)

[try secondary and see what that one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m19s)

[looks like I don't know why the primary](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m22s)

[is acting so funny](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m23s)

[I don't like the gray the gray just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m34s)

[feels wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m35s)

[well let's go with success for the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m44s)

[moment and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m46s)

[let's deal with layout and sizing and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m48s)

[then we might revisit that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m49s)

[that idea](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m51s)

[okay so the one of the things you can do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m54s)

[inside of here is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h40m59s)

[um load page specific CSS](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m01s)

[so I think that's what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m05s)

[because we have some CSS that we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m08s)

[probably want for just this one page](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m11s)

[uh oh I have to go here uh add](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m14s)

[uh is it not one of the built-in first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m18s)

[ones okay fine](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m21s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m24s)

[CSS but there's a magical way to do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m25s)

[so if you name it room Dot razer.css](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m28s)

[then you get this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m36s)

[um okay so let's do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m39s)

[I'm I'm I'm I'm all torn](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m45s)

[and I think we're gonna do something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m52s)

[like that and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m53s)

[okay really co-pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h41m57s)

[I'm a little shocked](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h42m02s)

[we're gonna try it because why not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h42m06s)

[why not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h42m09s)

[profile if you want it to Launch](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m43s)

[now I should be able to pick this up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m49s)

[yeah so Pro tip Allen there's a fun](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m51s)

[thing even though create room will gen](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m54s)

[you a random one uh you don't have to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m56s)

[use the random](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h46m58s)

[you can make up your own strings](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m00s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m07s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m12s)

[and if I come in here and do show votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m14s)

[that shows that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m18s)

[it's interesting that the other one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m22s)

[didn't that it didn't show the votes for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m23s)

[both of them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m25s)

[I wonder why this one isn't showing the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m29s)

[votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m32s)

[votes shown basically a persistent Link](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m36s)

[in that case yes yes you absolutely can](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m39s)

[um so that's the reason for the X the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m44s)

[missing space](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m47s)

[I'm just curious why](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m48s)

[this extra one doesn't have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m52s)

[why this one doesn't appear to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h47m59s)

[getting the vote shown toggle it should](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m01s)

[be showing up here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m03s)

[um let's see I need to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m06s)

[I need to have the facilitator drop](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m12s)

[and then I want a new](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m19s)

[one to come in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m24s)

[oh interesting so now I'm in this I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m36s)

[thought I had solved this where](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m38s)

[if the facilitator drops it promotes the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m40s)

[next one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m43s)

[maybe I didn't get that far let's look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m44s)

[we wrote some tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m50s)

[uh removes room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h48m57s)

[no no it doesn't actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m00s)

[handle that yet okay so that's not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m05s)

[expected to work but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m07s)

[when the votes are shown it should be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m11s)

[showing them on both sides](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m14s)

[um and actually if I open up a second](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m20s)

[one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m22s)

[not in that same browser it won't get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m23s)

[terminated](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m26s)

[so if he votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m27s)

[show votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m30s)

[I don't understand why this one's not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m33s)

[getting the votes to be shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m35s)

[because it's clearly toggling it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h49m50s)

[oh I have a theory](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m00s)

[I have a theory](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m02s)

[uh okay that theory is gone](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m06s)

[I was gonna argue that it was related to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m09s)

[this being](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m12s)

[an init property but that doesn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m13s)

[work other init properties are working](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m17s)

[just fine](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m19s)

[the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m29s)

[let's get a third user in the mix really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m37s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m39s)

[that way I can](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m41s)

[see more coming through so that works](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m44s)

[it's just the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h50m47s)

[I don't know like that's a very simple](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m06s)

[if condition](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m08s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m11s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m26s)

[and I'm gonna double check this property](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m31s)

[oh that's why that's why we went back to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m39s)

[a reservable property and then I didn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m42s)

[change I don't update it here that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m44s)

[that's what's going on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m48s)

[okay the other ones work because they're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m50s)

[computed properties this one is supposed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m52s)

[to be a computed property](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m54s)

[it is not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h51m56s)

[therefore it is only affecting the first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h52m00s)

[one got it got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h52m02s)

[no more white space on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h52m48s)

[because I don't like seeing that little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h52m53s)

[hyphen](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h52m55s)

[columns](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h54m13s)

[yeah I think we got a winner](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m18s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m19s)

[column small three because I believe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m22s)

[these are out of 12 if I remember](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m24s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m26s)

[let's take a quick Gander at the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m30s)

[displaced us](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m32s)

[I'm blocked](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m44s)

[yeah but I think this is what we want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m52s)

[I'm trying to remember what's the next](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m54s)

[columns to break onto a new line](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h55m56s)

[I guess I want to know what this W minus](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m00s)

[100 actually means](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m04s)

[that's not useful](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m13s)

[well when in doubt though it can still](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m19s)

[use it even if I'm ignorant don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m22s)

[understand what's what is going on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m24s)

[sorry one moment](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m35s)

[there okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m43s)

[okay so we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m46s)

[I want to format that again and we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m49s)

[gonna do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m53s)

[I want to put something like this in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m54s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h56m58s)

[and then I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m01s)

[I think let's do because this is column](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m05s)

[small three this is halfway across](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m08s)

[I kind of want to do column small](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m13s)

[two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m15s)

[and go four and then break](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m17s)

[I think is what I want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m21s)

[I think that's what I want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m26s)

[so we need to actually take these vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m29s)

[options and do some grouping stuff with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m33s)

[them so let's go up here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m35s)

[and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m37s)

[let's see the div is going to be outside](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m40s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m43s)

[and then we are going to need to do some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m45s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m50s)

[that and we're going to need to do some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m51s)

[grouping](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m54s)

[why is the formatting wrapping it into a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m56s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h57m59s)

[situation](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m03s)

[oh because I didn't do a at symbol so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m05s)

[it's confused as to what it's looking at](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m08s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m09s)

[got it got it gotta get it okay so let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m10s)

[do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m14s)

[let's actually get into a block and go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m16s)

[our options gets because I don't really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m18s)

[want to repeat this thing so many times](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m22s)

[okay uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m25s)

[uh VAR Rose is going to be options](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m29s)

[uh let's see we want to group into sets](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m35s)

[of four](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m38s)

[so I think we can do this can't we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m47s)

[see key selector](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m49s)

[TTT element](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m54s)

[so we can go with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m56s)

[option](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h58m58s)

[I I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m01s)

[then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m03s)

[I divided by](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m05s)

[four](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m07s)

[uh doesn't Group by have an overload](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m12s)

[that takes in a delegate of T source and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m15s)

[it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m20s)

[maybe I'm confusing it with the other](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m22s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m24s)

[I'm probably confusing it with the other](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m29s)

[ones](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m31s)

[uh there's a there is a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m32s)

[a grouping thingymabobber chunk chunk](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m35s)

[that's what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=00h59m39s)

[so we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m00s)

[reach VAR row options](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m04s)

[and actually I guess if we're going to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m08s)

[do if we're going to do this maneuver we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m10s)

[could just inline this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m11s)

[go like this it's a little big it's a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m14s)

[little ugly but hey we'll get by okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m16s)

[once we get that then we move this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m18s)

[inside](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m22s)

[and we move this inside](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m23s)

[and then we need inside of the row then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m27s)

[we want another for each](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m30s)

[uh VAR option in row options because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m33s)

[this will be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m37s)

[one to four items in this collection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m38s)

[um I guess we should](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m43s)

[I assume this is an array right isn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m47s)

[that what chunk returns](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m50s)

[yeah string array so we'll do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m53s)

[string array there and then we'll do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m56s)

[string here because I don't think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h00m58s)

[anyone's going to realize what those are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m00s)

[this buttony stuff up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m06s)

[for the moment it's going to go like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m09s)

[that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m12s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m13s)

[yeah so that will go there that will go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m16s)

[there and then the key part will be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m19s)

[this maneuver](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m22s)

[and after the four each we're gonna want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m25s)

[one of these](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m27s)

[right because this is row row](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m28s)

[we need this added here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m32s)

[and then we want this to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m36s)

[I said call six](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m41s)

[I think I want that to be a 2.](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m50s)

[to take up two columns](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m54s)

[yeah I don't understand this grid system](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m58s)

[very well](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h01m59s)

[um I think it's explained better here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m01s)

[uh grids are also responsible](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m05s)

[responsive not responsible](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m09s)

[yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m12s)

[variable width of content](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m16s)

[call eight](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m24s)

[oh so that's how many it takes uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m26s)

[and this is how big it is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m30s)

[so I actually want the if I want to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m32s)

[break this into groups of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m35s)

[if if I want four across](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m37s)

[I think I want this to be a three](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m46s)

[okay and then we're gonna whack all that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m47s)

[okay so if all of that has worked](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m51s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m53s)

[we should have rows of up to four items](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m55s)

[and then it should drop onto the next](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h02m58s)

[one ish](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m00s)

[let's see there's that oh where's my](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m04s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m07s)

[should be able to control F5 my way to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m09s)

[Victory here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m11s)

[okay so one two three four okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m13s)

[that's better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m16s)

[and then it resizes nicely as things get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m18s)

[bigger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m20s)

[okay that's that's not bad that's that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m27s)

[something that's that's getting better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m30s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m32s)

[get rid of this we don't want that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m35s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m38s)

[um let's see about setting up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m39s)

[so I'm surprised that vote button isn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m43s)

[being picked up on that guy so let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m48s)

[it's F12 that guy and just confirm that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m53s)

[it does have the style I expect and that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m56s)

[that style is defined](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h03m58s)

[Bubble Bum](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m01s)

[button](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m05s)

[there I may need to go double check](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m12s)

[because I don't see that other style](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m14s)

[listed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m17s)

[uh let's see here where is the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m19s)

[sources there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m23s)

[let's see CSS](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m26s)

[okay so it does not have the page](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m32s)

[specific uh pretty sweet progress see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m34s)

[you Alan get some rest](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m38s)

[okay so it did not load up the page](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m45s)

[specific CSS](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m48s)

[so I want to look at my other project](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m50s)

[and figure out what we did differently](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m52s)

[to get that to load](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m56s)

[because that should just work but I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h04m58s)

[remember it being touchy if you did it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m00s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m02s)

[show we're gonna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m04s)

[we're gonna just go go peeking](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m06s)

[okay so this guy here oh no I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m10s)

[client](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m14s)

[uh let's see this is probably one of the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m15s)

[simplest](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m18s)

[and that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m21s)

[that is really well zoomed in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m24s)

[um that loads all of that stuff](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m27s)

[razer.css](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m32s)

[I have to do something fancy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m35s)

[they're in Imports or something that I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m39s)

[that I whacked that I wasn't supposed to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m43s)

[uh let me check the non](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m48s)

[check this one here and make sure that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h05m53s)

[let's see open this bring you across](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m00s)

[let's see sources CSS I expect to see a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m04s)

[like a randomly generated CSS or maybe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m12s)

[it's in here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m15s)

[uh no I don't see it here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m23s)

[interesting so why did it is it here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m33s)

[I'm trying to remember how it gens up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m37s)

[the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m39s)

[oh there it is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m42s)

[there so this is this is the magic sauce](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m44s)

[that it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m47s)

[that it does is it embeds it here and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m48s)

[then fixes it up on the other side okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m51s)

[so it so it is okay so that it okay good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m53s)

[good good okay so the CSS is making it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m56s)

[in I was just too stupid to see it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h06m58s)

[right and I assume that's here as well](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m01s)

[great and then if I look at the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m04s)

[uh okay so let's get you out of the way](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m08s)

[uh and if I look at the page element](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m11s)

[itself](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m13s)

[devtools and I look at these buttons](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m15s)

[right that didn't load properly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m21s)

[because I did not name this properly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m28s)

[therefore it didn't pick it up got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m32s)

[got it got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m34s)

[okay close that I do not know why my](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m41s)

[devtool is freaking out so much there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m43s)

[it's exciting uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m46s)

[full F5](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m48s)

[okay so that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m50s)

[okay so definitely applied the the style](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m53s)

[okay so we do not want all of that but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h07m56s)

[we do want to change some of this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m00s)

[so let's clear all those out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m03s)

[let's see font size font weight](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m08s)

[uh I kind of want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m13s)

[a little bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m20s)

[uh let's see so let's do something like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m23s)

[uh Max](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m27s)

[width of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m30s)

[it's the right is there a good way to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m35s)

[a Max width maybe there isn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m43s)

[let's see is there a nice cssy way](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m43s)

[CSS make item square like I kind of want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m47s)

[to make the height](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h08m51s)

[I think we can conclude](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h13m54s)

[that's not right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m00s)

[smaller](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m18s)

[smaller is good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m21s)

[I'm saying bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m26s)

[doesn't like the fact that we have 13](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m47s)

[items 13 is not a square number](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m49s)

[why must the number be Prime](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h14m56s)

[so okay we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m01s)

[uh we're gonna come up here and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m03s)

[we're going to come down here and I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m25s)

[think we're going to do like a an H2](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m26s)

[uh vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m34s)

[I'm gonna do like a H2](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m34s)

[uh let's levitate something there just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m38s)

[so I can separate it and then down here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m41s)

[another H2 uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m44s)

[uh user votes something something to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m49s)

[that effect](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m52s)

[I love how it updates the CSS](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m54s)

[I had zero in Reverse so you can get rid](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m57s)

[of it oh yes you make me happy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h15m59s)

[Hang on we're gonna kill that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m02s)

[so in the interest of making a nice](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m04s)

[square number](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m07s)

[yay squares](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m08s)

[now it'll be birdie](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m12s)

[zero can be the the custom one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m15s)

[okay that spacing is atrocious](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m21s)

[and I hate it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m25s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m27s)

[we can](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m29s)

[uh room testing room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m31s)

[there because I think we're gonna get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m35s)

[some other options in here shortly and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m37s)

[then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m40s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m41s)

[we love that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m43s)

[there that looks better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m46s)

[we need something to control so that the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m54s)

[other users know that votes are hidden](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h16m57s)

[and not shown yet](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m00s)

[um I'm trying to decide where to put](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m05s)

[that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m10s)

[maybe what we do is over here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m18s)

[uh how about we go with something like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m20s)

[else](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m23s)

[uh span](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m25s)

[indeed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m28s)

[all right maybe we'll do maybe we'll do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m32s)

[something like that instead](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m33s)

[I like that better that makes me feel a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m41s)

[little nicer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m44s)

[that way while votes are hidden](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m47s)

[they stay there and then when votes are](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m56s)

[no longer hidden](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h17m58s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m04s)

[yeah we probably want to change it up so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m14s)

[it doesn't always show the facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m15s)

[as question marks and we need to break](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m17s)

[up how we display users into groups and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m19s)

[that kind of things but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m21s)

[we'll do we'll change that in a minute I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m25s)

[think this looks a little nicer we've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m27s)

[got some voting buttons we've got some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m29s)

[display](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m31s)

[yeah we're gonna ship this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m34s)

[this much works](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m37s)

[we're gonna we should probably add in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m39s)

[the clear or similar at some point or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m40s)

[the reset I guess is going to be the the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m42s)

[next one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h18m59s)

[uh I want to do something like this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h19m04s)

[where this thing ends up with some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h19m06s)

[margin on it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h19m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h19m10s)

[so specifically I don't care about left](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h19m10s)

[adding](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m20s)

[oh and maybe I should look really quick](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m23s)

[at the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m25s)

[the solar one did I close that page or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m27s)

[did I leave it open](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m31s)

[I think I closed it dang it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m33s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m36s)

[I did my window go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m40s)

[close it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m43s)

[probably let's go back and get it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m46s)

[uh let's see that one pretty please and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m50s)

[then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m53s)

[should really just bookmark this thing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m55s)

[for reference so I stopped having to go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m57s)

[back into the closed issues to find it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h20m59s)

[I'm getting really good at finding it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m03s)

[so there's the solar page](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m07s)

[is there a nice separator thingy here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m09s)

[that I want to use](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m13s)

[they've got this but that's not really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m27s)

[what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m30s)

[maybe we should do it maybe we should do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m44s)

[the users in a card rather than with a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m46s)

[header](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h21m47s)

[I wonder if maybe users should be in a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h22m12s)

[card instead](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h22m14s)

[then we may want to put some some](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h25m01s)

[spacing here but that line might be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h25m03s)

[enough to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h25m05s)

[move it around](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h25m06s)

[room state](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m26s)

[about uh reset](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m30s)

[trying to decide if reset state is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m34s)

[correct or reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m36s)

[let's do reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m39s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m44s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m45s)

[for null and then we're gonna start](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m48s)

[we're actually going to do some test](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m51s)

[driven design stuff first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m52s)

[so let's go in here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m55s)

[and do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m57s)

[and really these tests are even though](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h39m59s)

[I've labeled this as in memory room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m01s)

[manager tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m02s)

[a lot of these should actually be I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m04s)

[room manager](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m08s)

[um and I'm wondering if it's worth](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m11s)

[refactoring these really quick right now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m12s)

[I think it is I think it is so let's do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m14s)

[a public class room manager](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m18s)

[s](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m23s)

[uh and then this is going to be abstract](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m25s)

[and then something like this is going to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m29s)

[move down](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m31s)

[and then this is going to derive from](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m34s)

[room manager tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m36s)

[and then this guy oh shut up I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m39s)

[understand you're unhappy you're unhappy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m42s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m45s)

[this guy derives from this guy which is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m48s)

[fine but I don't want him tied to a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m50s)

[specific implementation so what I would](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m53s)

[like to do is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m56s)

[protected abstract I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h40m58s)

[room manager uh create](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m02s)

[manager Auto mocker](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m06s)

[and then that means this guy now has to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m11s)

[implement the method](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m14s)

[implement](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m17s)

[and then this guy is going to have a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m19s)

[very simple implementation](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m22s)

[um and actually you know we could do we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m25s)

[could make this even easier rather than](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m28s)

[doing an abstract method](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m29s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m31s)

[case in point with uh the the brain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m34s)

[teaser from the beginning of the Stream](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m37s)

[here's how you get yourself into that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m40s)

[abstract Base Class problem](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m42s)

[uh t u manager room manager and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m44s)

[we're going to set a requirement where T](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m48s)

[room manager okay go pilot you're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m51s)

[getting creepy I approve but you're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m53s)

[getting creepy no we don't want the new](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m55s)

[constraint](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m57s)

[and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h41m58s)

[just does that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m00s)

[okay uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m04s)

[and then this guy just needs to specify](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m07s)

[in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m09s)

[memory room manager so the only](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m10s)

[requirement will be that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m13s)

[uh let's see it needs to be reference](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m15s)

[type so this also needs to be a class](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m18s)

[not just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m21s)

[uh uh oh and class has to go first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m25s)

[uh something like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m30s)

[okay now I think pretty much all of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m34s)

[these tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m37s)

[because then when we go to write a new](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m39s)

[implementation of this interface it will](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m42s)

[it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m44s)

[um ensure that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m45s)

[everyone actually you know what we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m48s)

[going to do we're just going to copy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m49s)

[this line because this is going to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m51s)

[basically something everywhere it will](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m52s)

[ensure that all implementations that we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m54s)

[write these tests on that they all](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m56s)

[behave the same](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m57s)

[which makes me happy you know what I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h42m59s)

[not gonna do these one at a time we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m02s)

[gonna grab them all](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m03s)

[and we're gonna paste them all here and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m05s)

[we're gonna just hit them one at a time](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m08s)

[oh copy you and I'm gonna collapse them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m10s)

[as I go that one's done that one's done](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m14s)

[this way if I go and write like a redis](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m19s)

[implementation or something for this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m21s)

[then all I have to do is create a new](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m24s)

[base class from this testing base and I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m29s)

[will inherit all of the tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m33s)

[which is exactly what you want that will](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m35s)

[mean all of my implementations will have](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m38s)

[to enforce all the same](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m40s)

[business rules](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m42s)

[okay so we're gonna then take this guy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m48s)

[uh uh move him out there we go so these](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m52s)

[tests here are or I should say this guy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m57s)

[stays as a partial this still validates](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h43m59s)

[the Constructor arguments and so any](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m01s)

[tests that need to be specific to this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m03s)

[in-memory room manager](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m05s)

[um or specific to this implementation](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m08s)

[can live here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m10s)

[but all of the bass tests that all of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m11s)

[them need to follow are going to be here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m13s)

[okay so now what we want to do is write](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m15s)

[a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m18s)

[sing on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m20s)

[on this reset votes right and I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m24s)

[we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m27s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m35s)

[see public async uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m38s)

[async task reset](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m43s)

[um votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m46s)

[uh with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m48s)

[facilitator uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m51s)

[clears all votes so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h44m59s)

[you can kind of see this sort of setup](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m00s)

[here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m02s)

[we're going to do something real similar](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m04s)

[we're gonna do a room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m07s)

[we're gonna add a couple users to it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m09s)

[add the users to the room set them up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m13s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m15s)

[I also want to do a weight](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m18s)

[uh let's see submit vote one connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m21s)

[ID one so that's the facilitator so we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m24s)

[actually want to make](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m27s)

[this guy here do it and I kind of want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m29s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m32s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m35s)

[room state](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m41s)

[um gets and then I think we're just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m44s)

[gonna do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m46s)

[room dot uh vote options first](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m47s)

[because I don't wanna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m52s)

[hard coded to something that may or may](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m54s)

[not be a valid option we should probably](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m55s)

[at some point limit the vote submission](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m57s)

[to only things that are in the options](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h45m59s)

[but that's that's another problem](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m01s)

[and then we want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m05s)

[uh okay so that should do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m07s)

[that validates that that validates that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m11s)

[that goes there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m16s)

[um actually we don't actually care about](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m23s)

[this return](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m24s)

[that's the submit vote so the actual](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m25s)

[test that we want to do is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m28s)

[uh didn't we just call it clear votes or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m30s)

[remove votes reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m33s)

[is that the right one you said votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m37s)

[async it's the right thing that's what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m39s)

[we want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m40s)

[um so let's go back here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m42s)

[set votes async](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m45s)

[means I need to change it on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m48s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m50s)

[there uh okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m53s)

[the reset votes async](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m56s)

[it needs to take in a connection and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h46m59s)

[this needs to be the facilitator's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m01s)

[connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m03s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m05s)

[so we want to get back so vote shown](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m07s)

[should be false here and actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m09s)

[let's go one step further here and go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m13s)

[uh away set](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m16s)

[a show let's say sync](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m20s)

[true](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m23s)

[uh connection id1](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m27s)

[so the reset votes should hide them all](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m29s)

[again because we don't want to do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m33s)

[and then we want to do a search](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m35s)

[uh null](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m39s)

[room state](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m43s)

[and then this should be on all users](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m45s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m52s)

[I guess in this case we can so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h47m57s)

[stop it you're not null at this point uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m00s)

[user Sub Zero](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m03s)

[vote should be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m05s)

[no](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m08s)

[users one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m10s)

[vote should be known so this is this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m12s)

[where we're at live unit testing do your](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m14s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m17s)

[okay so reset votes is we're clearly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m20s)

[breaking there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m23s)

[uh where is my live unit attention](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m25s)

[it's off in the middle outline okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m28s)

[let's grab it let's check it check it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m31s)

[check it okay perfect](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m33s)

[no ref excellent](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m36s)

[so now we just beat this method into](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m38s)

[submission until the test passes and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m40s)

[actually while we're in here let's write](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m43s)

[one more](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m44s)

[Quick Test](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m45s)

[uh with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m47s)

[team member](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m50s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m52s)

[does not reset](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m54s)

[so we want this to still be true](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h48m58s)

[uh we want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m02s)

[that to be null and we want user one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m04s)

[vote to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m07s)

[equal to uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m10s)

[mode options](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m15s)

[so that's what this is what we expect](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m19s)

[we don't need the bag there anymore](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m22s)

[uh same with that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m24s)

[okay so if we get both of these working](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m29s)

[we can't be that bad off okay so let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m31s)

[let's actually go and implement it now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m34s)

[so inside of here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m35s)

[uh we want to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m39s)

[and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m45s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m47s)

[oh we want the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m51s)

[if it's not found](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m54s)

[or null](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m56s)

[I'm just noticing whenever I see myself](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h49m58s)

[copying and pasting code I immediately](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m00s)

[want to pause and just go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m01s)

[could I make this easier](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m05s)

[okay I've got that same pattern in a lot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m09s)

[of cases](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m19s)

[because I've got this with existing room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m20s)

[I kind of kind of want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m24s)

[private so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m33s)

[with existing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m37s)

[uh with connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m46s)

[action ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m49s)

[kind of want to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m51s)

[I don't want to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m56s)

[um and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h50m59s)

[this here becomes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m02s)

[uh update room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m06s)

[cool so then this whole thing simply](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m11s)

[becomes return with connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m14s)

[ID and then we do room Lambda](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m18s)

[and now at this point we've validated](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m23s)

[all the important bits](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m25s)

[we should probably change](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m27s)

[probably want to grab the user as well](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m31s)

[all right it's got a weird security](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m38s)

[alert](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m39s)

[I don't know which app is popping that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m44s)

[so I'm going to block it for the moment](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m50s)

[so I'm wondering because in this case I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m53s)

[do want to check the the user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m54s)

[but I think you need to find the user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h51m59s)

[so we should probably pass in the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m03s)

[this with connection probably should be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m07s)

[room State and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m10s)

[maybe good is that the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m12s)

[user ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m15s)

[yeah I think we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m19s)

[uh how about room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m21s)

[user ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m25s)

[we'll take both parameters which means](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m27s)

[this guy needs to pass in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m29s)

[uh we need to wrap this delegate up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m33s)

[and this is going to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m38s)

[uh okay so hang on what's the order of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m43s)

[delegates here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m46s)

[with existing room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m56s)

[uh why am I blanking on how to do on how](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h52m58s)

[to combine these delegates](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m00s)

[because this one I need to pass in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m04s)

[okay so let's let's break this up so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m11s)

[this becomes room oh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m14s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m18s)

[thank you my brain's fried your brain](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m19s)

[isn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m22s)

[for anyone not using GitHub copilot go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m26s)

[check it out try the demo see if it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m29s)

[saves you as much time as it's saving me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m31s)

[because it is an awesome awesome feature](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m33s)

[okay so room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m41s)

[so we want to find the user so user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m45s)

[Uh current user gets and we want room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m50s)

[yeah so we want that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m55s)

[uh if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m57s)

[current user is null](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h53m59s)

[or null](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m06s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m08s)

[so pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m09s)

[I just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m14s)

[I mean that's correct](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m19s)

[it's terrifying that you just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m21s)

[implemented that for me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m23s)

[but thank you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m26s)

[I mean](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m31s)

[that's just disgusting that is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m34s)

[disgusting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m37s)

[absolutely disgusting that it inferred](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m40s)

[all that logic](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m43s)

[um this is also not quite right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m45s)

[in that we also want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m48s)

[in addition to changing users we set](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m50s)

[votes shown to false in this case](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m53s)

[we want to turn we want to turn that off](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m57s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h54m59s)

[okay live unit testing do your thing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m02s)

[okay so to be clear one of the tests is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m07s)

[now passing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m10s)

[this one expected a change and it was](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m12s)

[not appropriately done so let's go and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m16s)

[look at the test](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m18s)

[so vote shown so this is just bad uh no](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m20s)

[this should still be true](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m24s)

[expected true but was false so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m28s)

[let's just make sure oh it's because we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m32s)

[didn't change this this should really be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m35s)

[using the other connection](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m37s)

[of the team member](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m39s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m43s)

[Tesla pass](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m45s)

[a huzzah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m47s)

[um while we're in here I think I'm Gonna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m51s)

[Change up a couple of these real quick](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m52s)

[so this is going to be returned uh with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m54s)

[connection connection ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h55m58s)

[and then in this case](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m00s)

[seriously did you just write the method](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m04s)

[for me Copilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m06s)

[is that right hold on what did it do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m16s)

[users](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m18s)

[room with users where room users know so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m23s)

[okay so okay good copilot didn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m26s)

[completely replace me it got darn close](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m28s)

[uh and it called this room ID when this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m34s)

[really should be room](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m37s)

[okay ha see I'm not as useless as I look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m39s)

[and this should be ID copilot come on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m42s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m45s)

[this is an amateur hour co-pilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m48s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m56s)

[that does it and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h56m59s)

[we'll just let the live unit testing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m01s)

[validate that we didn't break anything](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m03s)

[that we did](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m04s)

[no one can replace Kevin I don't know](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m06s)

[the like I said before the the joke that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m10s)

[I have going is that co-pilot is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m13s)

[probably a really poorly named system](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m15s)

[because it really does feel like it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m17s)

[driving and I'm the one in the passenger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m20s)

[seat along for the ride](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m22s)

[sub-optimal outcome](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m29s)

[your flattery is appreciated](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m31s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m33s)

[okay copilot do it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m36s)

[is that right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m39s)

[uh uh no no co-pilot you're not quite](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m44s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m49s)

[I mean you're getting closer but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m50s)

[you're that's you're wrong you still](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m53s)

[haven't figured out that this is user ID](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m55s)

[not user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h57m59s)

[they're getting real close though real](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m01s)

[close](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m06s)

[so that cleans that up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m08s)

[that cleans that up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m12s)

[just making this code a little bit nicer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m15s)

[return and this is why we write unit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m19s)

[tests right here because I am not even](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m22s)

[in the least bit concerned that I've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m24s)

[broken anything](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m25s)

[here if I do the if I give you the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m27s)

[parameter names this time copilot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m29s)

[implement it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m34s)

[uh yeah no that ain't even close ah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m36s)

[AI](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m45s)

[can't have my job yet can't have my job](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m47s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m50s)

[okay and I know ad user to room is kind](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m53s)

[of a special case because that has to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m55s)

[with the creation so that goes there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h58m57s)

[these are all my helpers](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m00s)

[and you'll note I could have made all of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m02s)

[these one big thing like because there's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m04s)

[with room lock that's invoked by with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m06s)

[existing room that's invoked by with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m10s)

[connection but sometimes I like having](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m12s)

[this these tiers because it it starts to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m14s)

[separate when often if you put them all](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m17s)

[in one method you'll find that you need](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m19s)

[bits and pieces of them and so allowing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m20s)

[you to stack them and kind of chain them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m23s)

[together in a more functional sense](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m24s)

[works a lot better](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m27s)

[at least in my experience okay so that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m29s)

[there that's their](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m32s)

[okay we need to have now we need to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m34s)

[actually expose something to call uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m36s)

[reset books so next up we go to the hub](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m39s)

[and we're going to need a method so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m42s)

[let's go here and do I don't know](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m45s)

[something called re set whoa okay that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m48s)

[getting creepy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=01h59m53s)

[okay copilot figure it out](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m02s)

[that's pretty good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m07s)

[next line](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m09s)

[nothing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m13s)

[okay that's pretty good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m17s)

[okay that that's that's fine you did it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m20s)

[on the connection now implement the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m22s)

[entire method on my hub for me go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m24s)

[okay that's pretty good next](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m29s)

[yeah that looks about right](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m37s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m39s)

[is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m42s)

[this is just wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m44s)

[absolutely wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m47s)

[I did have some colleagues tell me that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m50s)

[they're that they're like I don't get](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m52s)

[the same same behavior or same](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m54s)

[awesomeness that co-pilot seems to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m56s)

[for you and you know questioning if I've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h00m58s)

[got some special setup I don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m03s)

[but I did tell them that the secret](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m04s)

[sauce to co-pilot is to talk to it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m06s)

[now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m10s)

[I don't think they actually wrote code](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m11s)

[that listens in on my microphone however](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m13s)

[it's doing a pretty good job](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m16s)

[okay okay that's exciting let's go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m19s)

[reset did we not implement it on the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h01m56s)

[we know it implemented on the interface](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m00s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m02s)

[me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m08s)

[nothing you just you're gonna give up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m11s)

[okay fine I'll write the math you did](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m13s)

[the last one I'll handle this one](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m15s)

[okay happy there you go there you go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m21s)

[close view close you close you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m28s)

[okay reset votes async should probably](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m31s)

[add that to my tests](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h02m33s)

[without the Hub connection can you do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h03m51s)

[the other side of the branch](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h03m53s)

[pretty please](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h03m56s)

[allowed to use self-closing and when I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h04m59s)

[not uh so let's see so on click](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m00s)

[uh we're gonna do view model dot reset](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m06s)

[rotate sync](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m11s)

[and then we're going to do a class and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m13s)

[we want this guy to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m16s)

[danger danger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m41s)

[should we go with danger or warning](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m45s)

[still warning I guess](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h05m50s)

[warning it shall be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m00s)

[uh let's see and then we'll do something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m01s)

[like uh reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m04s)

[and then pink is awesome but no uh Alan](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m08s)

[want to move](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m29s)

[I think we need to go grid system on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m33s)

[because I'm kind of thinking reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m36s)

[should live over here like I don't like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m38s)

[there's something to be said about](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m41s)

[having a good amount of white space](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m42s)

[between](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m47s)

[between when you're showing and when](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m49s)

[you're resetting to make sure you don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m51s)

[like your cursor shouldn't be next to it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m52s)

[so let's go back to the bootstrappy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h06m55s)

[docs and this is what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h07m00s)

[space and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m37s)

[I believe what I want is called](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m39s)

[if it's at a 12](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m43s)

[to 11 is this zero based I can't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m45s)

[remember](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m48s)

[I can't remember when you want to set](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m49s)

[the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m51s)

[yeah so I kind of want to do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h08m56s)

[percentage based right so I want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m02s)

[that and then I want to do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m10s)

[yeah let's see what that looks like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m16s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m28s)

[okay so that's that's incorrect we don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m31s)

[want that thing spanning like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m34s)

[um and I do want to say](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m45s)

[because the only reason the other one is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m49s)

[set like that is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m51s)

[this guy has a width of 80 and I okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m54s)

[I know you're not supposed to do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h09m58s)

[I'm doing it anyway](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m01s)

[okay so we're going to do that just so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m03s)

[that those things size appropriately](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m05s)

[I then want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m09s)

[can I oh I don't want text Center that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m13s)

[probably what's making the weird sizing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m16s)

[bit let's try that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m18s)

[and in theory a hot reload is supposed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m28s)

[to be working](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m30s)

[okay so that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m32s)

[closer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m37s)

[still not quite](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m39s)

[I mean it's it's getting to where I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m41s)

[it open Dev tools please](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m43s)

[but I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m46s)

[I definitely don't like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m49s)

[that stacking](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m57s)

[I'm curious why](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h10m59s)

[this container being sized at 80 percent](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m02s)

[isn't the same size as the card](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m06s)

[oh the card is size that they are size](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m09s)

[the same](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m12s)

[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m30s)

[uh okay so this guy here I don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m33s)

[understand why it is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m37s)

[okay back to the back to the grid system](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m43s)

[uh variable width content](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m50s)

[so I think that's what I want on this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h11m58s)

[first one is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m00s)

[I want this to be Auto](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m04s)

[I see worse than putting in style in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m11s)

[line](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m13s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m14s)

[that's fair at some point I should clean](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m15s)

[that up and I and I I do want to figure](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m18s)

[out why even though this thing's size to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m20s)

[80 why I'm getting that look but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m22s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m26s)

[so what I'd like to do in an ideal](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m27s)

[situation I want this guy left Justified](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m29s)

[and this guy lined up even with this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m33s)

[that's kind of what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m36s)

[and I'm wondering if at the end of the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m41s)

[day what I really need to do is put them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m43s)

[both in the same grid](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m45s)

[that would probably make this a little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m47s)

[nicer if I had](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m49s)

[one container because right now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m51s)

[oh railgun thanks for the follow I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m56s)

[appreciate it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m58s)

[if I put them in the same grid that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h12m59s)

[might eliminate some of this confusion](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h13m01s)

[see close that close that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h13m48s)

[uh in unity though](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h13m56s)

[oh that's great](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h13m58s)

[that Unity is another one that is on my](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m00s)

[list of things to learn](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m03s)

[because it definitely is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m06s)

[for for cross-platform stuff it is it is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m13s)

[definitely an interesting solution](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m17s)

[especially with all of the built-in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m18s)

[stuff I've got several colleagues who](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m20s)

[are who like to play games and or like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m22s)

[to build out games and highly recommend](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m26s)

[Unity](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m28s)

[uh okay so that did not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m30s)

[do what I expected](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m34s)

[oh I guess that's kind of expected](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m36s)

[though because that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m39s)

[uh of course about free roaming combat](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m42s)

[my game](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m45s)

[I wanted to work on though oh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m47s)

[um there's no column span here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h14m57s)

[so I this I actually do want to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m00s)

[like call 10 and then I want all SM](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m04s)

[two I think right because this puts it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m10s)

[in the tenth column and only uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m13s)

[allocates two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m15s)

[don't you want to put those in the same](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m17s)

[row uh this and this are in the same row](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m18s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m22s)

[I think they're in the same row](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m30s)

[wait would you like to enable you're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m33s)

[telling me I could have just been](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m35s)

[apparently I just needed to turn the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m39s)

[thing on](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m41s)

[excellent I was worried I was worried it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m42s)

[was going to be difficult](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m48s)

[okay so that didn't quite do what I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m52s)

[wanted either](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m54s)

[uh let's see big](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h15m57s)

[go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m01s)

[so this thing here is bothering me that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m10s)

[it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m13s)

[why is my row offset so much](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m14s)

[there's the container](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m19s)

[well so I'm attempting to use the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m23s)

[this this may be to my own detriment](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m25s)

[some of it is trying to understand this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m28s)

[grid system in bootstrap](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m30s)

[well I wonder if this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m38s)

[so I don't uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m50s)

[because I really want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m52s)

[S I wonder if Okay Okay Okay so let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m55s)

[okay we're gonna try this here now that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h16m59s)

[theoretically the browser link stuff is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m01s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m04s)

[justify](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m07s)

[content](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m09s)

[there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m15s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m18s)

[button press](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m20s)

[close the dev tools](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m24s)

[I guess I really should open them to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m28s)

[make sure that that updated](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m30s)

[appropriately because I didn't see it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m31s)

[Flash](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m32s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m39s)

[yeah I don't know what's going on so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m41s)

[we're gonna go there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m43s)

[but it sort of makes sense why it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m44s)

[wouldn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m46s)

[justify the I don't understand why the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m47s)

[first one's not justified left](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m50s)

[this is what I sometimes run away](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m54s)

[oh it's not supposed to be hard it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h17m58s)

[it's supposed to be easy but my own](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m03s)

[ignorance is making this hard](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m05s)

[um and I think some of it is just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m09s)

[needing to understand the content here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m11s)

[uh let's see row row calls Auto](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m16s)

[I don't really want automatic](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m21s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m24s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m31s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m33s)

[um let's look here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m37s)

[there's a containers that I might want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m40s)

[to look at](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m46s)

[spending an entire width in the viewport](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m49s)

[no I think I think we we do want to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m52s)

[here setting one column width](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h18m59s)

[the uh one of three](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m00s)

[two is three](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m04s)

[three of three](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m09s)

[oh so this is okay so this is an index](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m15s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m17s)

[uh got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m18s)

[got it so this really should just be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m21s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m27s)

[because I don't know how to do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m32s)

[properly](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m34s)

[right it should go like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m40s)

[keeps walking about button and close tag](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m42s)

[div](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m45s)

[or closed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m47s)

[um I think that gets me what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m50s)

[one column ten columns and nothing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m53s)

[last column which isn't quite what I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m56s)

[actually want though](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h19m59s)

[yeah because that's that's snaps](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m06s)

[more importantly show votes for whatever](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m16s)

[reason this thing has](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m18s)

[okay let's get rid of this with 80](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m21s)

[because that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m23s)

[biting me all over the place](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m25s)

[and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m30s)

[bigger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m35s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m40s)

[not sure exactly how to do what I want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m42s)

[and maybe a grid is the wrong answer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m45s)

[maybe a grid is the wrong answer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m49s)

[because we're going to end up having](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h20m57s)

[multiple things](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m01s)

[Auto columns](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m03s)

[this might be useful for our buttons](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m14s)

[columns for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m26s)

[this might be good enough here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m33s)

[oh jovial thank you very much I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m46s)

[appreciate that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m49s)

[it's just the auto property I believe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h21m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m12s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m14s)

[got it okay so if these gaps](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m18s)

[I wonder if maybe that's all I need](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m24s)

[because really all I'm trying to do is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m26s)

[get the clear votes button](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m28s)

[far enough away from the show votes that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m31s)

[the user doesn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m33s)

[accidentally](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m36s)

[um click it that's really all we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m38s)

[trying to do is separate that up](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m40s)

[and actually you know what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m43s)

[there was a we were already kind of in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m46s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m52s)

[I'm wondering if maybe I'm using the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h22m58s)

[wrong hang on let's take a brief Gander](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m00s)

[down this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m02s)

[I'm kind of wondering if there is a good](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m17s)

[way if I'm maybe using the wrong](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m19s)

[wrong control](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m23s)

[take a look here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m26s)

[inline Flex](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m31s)

[okay that looks](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m33s)

[use the Justified contents to change the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m49s)

[alignment of flex items on the main axis](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m52s)

[I think this might be more more where](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m53s)

[I'm going for](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h23m56s)

[this might be more](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m01s)

[this might be more my speed okay I think](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m10s)

[that's actually what we want so we don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m14s)

[want this we want this we don't want](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m16s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m18s)

[we don't want this we don't want this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m19s)

[but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m22s)

[let's figure that out clear that out but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m23s)

[if I'm understanding this correctly what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m26s)

[I actually want to do is take this and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m28s)

[then just do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m32s)

[uh justify content](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m34s)

[because this item here is really what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m38s)

[I'm I'm looking to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m42s)

[right justify content left well this is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m44s)

[how do they do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m50s)

[uh let's see one two three four one two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m53s)

[three four justify content between](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h24m58s)

[so is that really as simple as me doing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m02s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m07s)

[getting rid of well I guess I don't need](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m09s)

[this div](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m11s)

[ided this div I'll leave that div there](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m13s)

[because I have a sinking suspicion I'm](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m16s)

[going to want it in a second](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m18s)

[is it really that easy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m21s)

[everyone always tells me CSS is really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m24s)

[easy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m26s)

[and it's so much nicer than xaml and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m28s)

[every time I use it I long for my WPF](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m30s)

[hey look at that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m32s)

[okay that that's that's gonna work](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m38s)

[that's gonna work okay so let's let's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m41s)

[let's let's let's let's test this really](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m44s)

[quick and make sure it works so I've got](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m46s)

[one user two user right so they're all](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m48s)

[they're all loaded first user is going](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m51s)

[to vote a three second user's gonna vote](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m52s)

[a five and then the the facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m54s)

[comes in and goes show votes we've got a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h25m58s)

[three and a five great let's that shows](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m00s)

[three and five there great let's go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m04s)

[through and reset the votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m06s)

[okay so aside from this thing not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m09s)

[appropriately going backwards that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m11s)

[worked great](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m17s)

[that should have been right here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m21s)

[reset votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m25s)

[shown false votes shown false](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m31s)

[false](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m35s)

[okay so that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m41s)

[the backing data store is appropriately](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m44s)

[there but the toggle didn't change](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m47s)

[so I had assumed buying value](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m51s)

[would have done that for me](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h26m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m00s)

[shown as false yeah the toggle isn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m04s)

[being updated and I had assumed bind](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m07s)

[value would have done that but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m15s)

[go back](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m17s)

[for example buying value and buying](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m20s)

[value will assign the current value](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m22s)

[it's only binding one way from changing](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m34s)

[the toggle](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m37s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m39s)

[is this as simple as](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m53s)

[is is it that easy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h27m59s)

[Maybe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h28m01s)

[okay we don't need other users this time](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h28m10s)

[that makes sense](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m11s)

[now granted co-pilot wrote the vast](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m13s)

[majority of this code so there's that we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m15s)

[cleaned all of those up I'm less](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m18s)

[concerned with that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m20s)

[uh most of the tests moved here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m34s)

[uh check-ins I could confirm it as we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h29m39s)

[because this is going to be purely UI](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h30m50s)

[related](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h30m54s)

[we'll see we'll see okay so let's go](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h31m06s)

[uh give me this sense](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m20s)

[the only thing I don't like about hidden](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m23s)

[is that name](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m25s)

[doesn't convey that this is really just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m26s)

[for the facilitators](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m28s)

[so no we're not gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m30s)

[I don't think that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m34s)

[Damian is one of the things that's hard](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m36s)

[we've got that we've got that we've](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m48s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m51s)

[I'm trying to decide if preview should](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m53s)

[be for all facilitators or if it should](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m55s)

[just be on a per user basis I'd kind of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h32m57s)

[like the per user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m00s)

[I kind of like per user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m02s)

[yeah let's make it just per user and not](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m07s)

[something that syncs because again we](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m09s)

[aren't really concerned with security](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m11s)

[here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m13s)

[like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m14s)

[there is no off there is no sign in like](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m15s)

[if](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m19s)

[if somebody sneaks and looks at votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m21s)

[ahead of time which is totally doable](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m24s)

[like that's not a big deal](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m25s)

[um let's go here so if that is set what](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m30s)

[we want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m34s)

[is we want to show the votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m36s)

[I don't want them to be able to do that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m40s)

[I agree but at a certain point there's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m42s)

[we have to implement like real auth to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m46s)

[to lock it down](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h33m49s)

[risk of deferring to senior persons so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m02s)

[their votes don't look wrong as a threat](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m04s)

[that is true and that's hiding](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m09s)

[where I sometimes vote absurdly just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m29s)

[can we just you know fix these few typos](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m37s)

[in this little bit of description and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m40s)

[it's like yes that's that is a 13-point](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m42s)

[story](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m44s)

[and everybody else votes like one or two](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m47s)

[uh okay so what is the logic here then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m50s)

[so if the votes are shown we want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m53s)

[this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m56s)

[I think what we want to do is else if a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h34m58s)

[view model is facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m01s)

[uh and preview votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m06s)

[um I don't know we don't need to do this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m16s)

[check here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m18s)

[um I do think I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m20s)

[maybe if it lets them do it but lets](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m27s)

[everyone know users speaking well this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m29s)

[is only going to be for the facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m30s)

[rules which generally the facilitator](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m32s)

[isn't a a team member also voting this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m35s)

[is usually like your scrum master or po](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m38s)

[or somebody running the show](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m45s)

[yeah yeah so facilitator only lets you](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m49s)

[preview](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m51s)

[and it's really just there so that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m53s)

[as they're going through and doing it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m57s)

[they can kind of mentally see where](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h35m59s)

[things are going and decide hey you know](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m01s)

[we don't need much discussion the team's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m03s)

[already you know come to a consensus or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m05s)

[whatnot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m07s)

[um but I do think I want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m09s)

[I kind of want to so there needs to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m12s)

[there needs to be some sort of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m14s)

[formatting here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m19s)

[so let's do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m22s)

[vote preview I think something like that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m24s)

[and let's come in here and we're gonna](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m28s)

[do because there is other stories where](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m30s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m34s)

[there's desire like if a user changes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m35s)

[their vote after the votes have been](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m37s)

[revealed](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m39s)

[like let that happen but like show their](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m40s)

[original twos and show them differently](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m43s)

[so that it's clear that oh you know](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m45s)

[after the votes were revealed maybe](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m47s)

[there was more discussion and you know](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m49s)

[so and so bumped their vote up or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m51s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m52s)

[um this is all completely wrong uh no](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m54s)

[copilot you're wrong I want to do](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m57s)

[something like font weight or](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h36m59s)

[font style](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m03s)

[italic yeah I just wanna I just want it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m06s)

[to look a little different when when](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m08s)

[it's a preview](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m11s)

[um yeah because if votes are shown we're](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m15s)

[going to fall into this case here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m16s)

[and then go through and do it okay so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m19s)

[this this should just work now](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m21s)

[this feels a little too easy](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m26s)

[so let's get me uh let's give me a user](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m31s)

[to vote with](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m34s)

[uh preview votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m36s)

[oh that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m40s)

[I just realized that toggle is bloody](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m42s)

[hard to see we're gonna have to change](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m45s)

[that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m48s)

[do that but why does my preview votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m50s)

[not have a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m53s)

[check box](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m55s)

[I'm missing something](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h37m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m01s)

[why is that what happened to my element](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m05s)

[uh huh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m14s)

[I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m16s)

[like I knew I was jinxing myself the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m17s)

[moment I'm like Oh and it should just](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m19s)

[work like I I kind of knew bad things](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m21s)

[were about to happen](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m23s)

[review roads](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m28s)

[oh the check box is all the way](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m32s)

[oh it's um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m38s)

[okay got it got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m41s)

[got because of the container God I got](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m43s)

[it yes yes yes yes yes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m46s)

[got it so this needs to go here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m52s)

[the fun of dark mode of sorts I like the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m55s)

[vote UI though what if the box is](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h38m58s)

[stretched with the window gets bigger](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m00s)

[and the columns are increased yeah that](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m01s)

[needs some work](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m04s)

[um I after seeing the the auto columns I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m05s)

[think that's probably going to be a](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m09s)

[better solution](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m10s)

[because though not an MVP requirement](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m12s)

[um see I want I want these guys in a in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m15s)

[their own div](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m19s)

[so they get grouped together as part of](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m20s)

[the auto side](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m25s)

[and right now we're kind of cheating it](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m27s)

[because we know how many are going to be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m29s)

[in that set](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m31s)

[so that we got away with that a little](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m32s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m38s)

[there that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m43s)

[I don't know if that's better or worse](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m45s)

[having them stacked I was kind of hoping](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m47s)

[for side by side](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m49s)

[I need to look into why that's going but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m50s)

[uh so it's supposed to support hot](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m56s)

[reload](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h39m59s)

[I have just had some trouble with the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m00s)

[tooling and getting it to work](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m02s)

[so](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m04s)

[yeah if I do preview votes](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m07s)

[it shows me the 13.](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m10s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m18s)

[by show votes it gets off of the italics](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m19s)

[I don't know if that's](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m22s)

[not bad](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m30s)

[like so it's it's working as design I](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m32s)

[just don't know if I like the layout](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m34s)

[here](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m37s)

[go back to the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m39s)

[because this is where](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m43s)

[these guys all come into play](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m51s)

[I think I want to drop](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h40m56s)

[one of these guys but I'm not entirely](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m02s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m04s)

[which or why these things wouldn't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m06s)

[go side by side](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m09s)

[why would there be a break after them](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m12s)

[um it is probably one of the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m17s)

[is probably one of those styles from the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m23s)

[toggle or similar but let's look](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m26s)

[okay so I imagine you are my problem](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m30s)

[child](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m35s)

[where would you be](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h41m58s)

[confusing me is why](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m21s)

[despite the name it does not actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m27s)

[turn off hot root load](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m28s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m30s)

[uh let's see here let's not external](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m34s)

[opened up multiple side browsers](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h42m51s)

[maybe I'm just being dense and I don't](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h43m27s)

[understand how this is working and this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h43m28s)

[this div is what's actually doing it to](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h43m31s)

[me but](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h43m33s)

[the users to get their names because](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m14s)

[uh or how about allow a user to re](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m36s)

[connect](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m40s)

[doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m44s)

[the user comes back in](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m49s)

[cash their the last used name that they](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h49m54s)

[after the user has](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m23s)

[provided their name we should store this](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m26s)

[in a cookie and](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m35s)

[uh reuse it when the](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m38s)

[user connects because we don't actually](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m43s)

[care](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m46s)

[user that we care to manage](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m49s)

[themselves an observer](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m57s)

[and then disconnects and reconnects they](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h50m59s)

[would get thrown into the team member](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h51m01s)

[role so maybe we cash their role too](https://youtu.be/288Iepb9waE?t=02h51m02s)
