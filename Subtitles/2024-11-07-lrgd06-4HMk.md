[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m01s)

[we're going to dive back into the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m04s)

[material design and examl and kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m06s)

[pick up with uh where we left off last](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m07s)

[time uh I am aware I have failed to post](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m10s)

[the the YouTube recording of last week's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m12s)

[session that will be forthcoming](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m15s)

[possibly later tonight um I had a small](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m17s)

[issue with my Automation and then once I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m20s)

[fixed it I forgot to actually post a so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m21s)

[we are going to look at that uh but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m24s)

[first couple quick announcements uh one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m27s)

[faces over here uh there last week I did](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m30s)

[a workshop with Git Kraken uh how to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m34s)

[undo get mistakes like a pro and if you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m37s)

[missed it the good news is the recording](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m41s)

[is now live so getcrackin.com slw](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m43s)

[workshops they also have upcoming ones](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m47s)

[uh this work trees and get Kraken that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m50s)

[is the the one for November which actual](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m52s)

[date](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m55s)

[TBD uh just with the timing of the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m56s)

[ones I suspect it'll be end of the month](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h00m58s)

[is uh but that one should be very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m00s)

[exciting I I love work trees and so it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m04s)

[will be cool to see that one come but if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m06s)

[you missed it like I said it is uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m08s)

[available and actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m10s)

[link on YouTube uh it looks like uh get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m13s)

[Kraken has the the YouTube One unlisted](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m19s)

[so if you're subscribed to their YouTube](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m21s)

[channel you won't see it there um but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m23s)

[you can get the direct link underneath](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m25s)

[to watch it now um the other one one is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m27s)

[I did a talk uh last night it's only](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m31s)

[been a day I would like to think I can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m35s)

[remember that far uh with the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m44s)

[spokane.to make me log in ah cheater](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m52s)

[this one however you can just go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m55s)

[straight to uh intellex](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h01m57s)

[YouTube uh and you can find it or if you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m01s)

[want a direct link uh there's that one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m03s)

[there and there is all of the cool stuff](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m06s)

[uh I will say for the astute observers](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m08s)

[um there is a repo that I uh was working](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m11s)

[out of the new net 9 so anybody is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m15s)

[interested just a fury of links uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m19s)

[underneath my GitHub there is a new net](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m23s)

[n uh repository the the important thing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m26s)

[here is all of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m30s)

[branches this is this is the exciting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m32s)

[stuff um and anybody who was paying](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m34s)

[really close attention in my talk](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m37s)

[realized I was an idiot and I actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m39s)

[made a mistake because I get Kraken](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m42s)

[shows your commits and chronological](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m44s)

[order which is great except for I got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m46s)

[all the way up through link I went to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m49s)

[Json I followed all the way up through](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m51s)

[Json and I completely skipped over the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m53s)

[changes the time span and Reed Jax went](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m55s)

[damn dang it didn't realize that till](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h02m59s)

[later so for anybody who wants a sneak](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m01s)

[uh Peak talk about it real quick now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m04s)

[this so spoiler uh there is very little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m08s)

[that is revolutionary in this version of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m12s)

[CP and.net it is a little Bor um frankly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m13s)

[uh but there are a handful of nice](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m20s)

[little things that got thrown in there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m23s)

[so watch the full video for more detail](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m25s)

[this one here I don't know if anyone can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m28s)

[even tell the difference if you can see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m31s)

[the difference in what was added in net](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m33s)

[n here you get yourself a gold star um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m35s)

[the key thing here is we go through and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m39s)

[run](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m42s)

[this net](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m43s)

[run](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m46s)

[right you will note that these two](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m49s)

[values right are not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m51s)

[matching right 831 999 the astute uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h03m54s)

[computer science person in all of us](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m00s)

[will point out and go oh I understand](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m02s)

[what's going on this is a uh a double we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m04s)

[have a floating Point Precision problem](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m06s)

[uh we can't represent that in binary and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m09s)

[yada y yada because time span with its](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m10s)

[various from methods uh previously took](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m13s)

[doubles which worked out pretty well uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m16s)

[except for you know in cases like this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m19s)

[now the from methods have integer](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m22s)

[overloads](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m26s)

[aah I know really Revolution tionary](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m27s)

[exciting um but it does mean then that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m30s)

[you need to go through and do something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m32s)

[of this nature great right again nothing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m34s)

[major revolutionary but there's there's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m38s)

[now in overloads okay Rex Rex the thing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m40s)

[near and dear to my heart the way we go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m43s)

[through and make lots of changes across](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m45s)

[the board so for people unfamiliar with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m48s)

[it there is the source generator for Rex](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m51s)

[something that uh came in a version or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m54s)

[two ago with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h04m58s)

[umnet where you can actually have uh the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m00s)

[compiler generate the uh the FSA for the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m04s)

[Rex the parser for it at compile time](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m08s)

[rather than at run time because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m11s)

[previously what would happen is you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m12s)

[would new up a new Rex instance and it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m13s)

[would then have to parse this pattern at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m16s)

[runtime The Source generator can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m18s)

[actually do that same parsing at compile](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m20s)

[time assuming your Rex pattern is known](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m22s)

[at compile time obviously this does not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m24s)

[work if you've got some sort of dynamic](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m26s)

[building of this pattern are similar](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m29s)

[right but for a lot of us the patterns](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m31s)

[are known at compile time so we can gain](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m32s)

[some nice performance out of this which](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m35s)

[is great um and so typically if we had](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m36s)

[something like this where we were going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m40s)

[to split across all of the words right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m41s)

[so if I uh net run this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m43s)

[Beast put myself back over right we can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m48s)

[see it breaks it apart per word great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m51s)

[huzzah um but the the issue here is we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m53s)

[had to build out an entire array now now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m57s)

[this can get big if this is a big string](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h05m59s)

[or similar and so allocating big arrays](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m01s)

[is not great and in this case all we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m04s)

[wanted to do was iterate over the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m06s)

[collection of words not a big](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m08s)

[deal if we look at what's new in net](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m11s)

[n we get this lovely little guy we can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m16s)

[now enumerate splits which means we can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m18s)

[now iterate over all of these and pull](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m22s)

[out the the individual ones so if I IET](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m26s)

[run this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m29s)

[again right we can see we get the exact](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m32s)

[same output as what we got before](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m34s)

[individual words come through great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m36s)

[there's a couple interesting things that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m39s)

[are happening here though this enumerate](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m41s)

[splits the data type and then you'll](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m44s)

[also note that rather than just giving](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m46s)

[us back the the individual words it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m48s)

[actually giving us back a range a lot of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m51s)

[the stuff in CP and.net this update are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m53s)

[around performance avoiding allocations](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m56s)

[I often times tell people in C we don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h06m58s)

[have performance problems we have memory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m00s)

[problems memory problems memory problems](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m02s)

[because when the garbage collector runs](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m04s)

[you freeze and so the way we go faster](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m06s)

[is we don't run the garbage collector](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m09s)

[which means don't make a mess so if you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m12s)

[make a mess the garbage collector cleans](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m14s)

[up after you if you don't allocate](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m15s)

[there's nothing for it to clean up it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m17s)

[doesn't run you go faster and often](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m19s)

[times that's where we see a lot of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m22s)

[significant performance gains is around](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m24s)

[memory allocation and memory management](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m27s)

[rather than you know just making an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m29s)

[algorithm run](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m30s)

[faster so here we end up getting back a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m32s)

[range and so we actually have to go back](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m34s)

[to the original string and then we apply](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m36s)

[the range to be able to get back the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m39s)

[individual result because the range has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m41s)

[a uh a start and a length on it so that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m44s)

[you know exactly where to pull from so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m46s)

[this is building on top of other things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m49s)

[the other interesting part here uh is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m51s)

[this innumerable is not actually and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m54s)

[actually if I um back to my beloved](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m56s)

[would cracken if I open this uh file](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h07m59s)

[manager just pop this open in Visual](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m03s)

[Studio because I think visual studio](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m06s)

[does this better than vs](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m07s)

[code there's an interesting thing to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m11s)

[look at here and if you watch the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m13s)

[recording from the user group talk I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m14s)

[mess up I get this VAR confused with a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m16s)

[different VAR I get all I get all I get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m19s)

[all turned around all right so this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m21s)

[enumerate splits is not just an i](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m24s)

[enumerable of range it's this reject](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m26s)

[value splitter innumerable and you'll](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m30s)

[note in the uh interest of making things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m32s)

[go fast and avoid allocations this is a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m35s)

[ref struck now this is one of those](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m38s)

[areas where I don't see a lot of people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m40s)

[riding ref structs in in day-to-day C](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m43s)

[they're great they're awesome you can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m47s)

[use them to get uh very good performance](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m49s)

[but you have to know what you're doing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m52s)

[and I think a lot of developers are more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m53s)

[likely to consume them with a API guys](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m56s)

[like this uh versus actually uh writing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h08m59s)

[them themselves but this guy here uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m03s)

[you'll note doesn't even Implement I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m07s)

[enumerable you can't cannot even go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m09s)

[through and say oh well I'm just going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m11s)

[to enumerate this I want this to be an i](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m14s)

[inumerable of range right just doesn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m15s)

[work and the reason it doesn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m19s)

[work is because for each is implemented](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m22s)

[with duct typing inside of C what that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m25s)

[means is you can for each over anything](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m28s)

[that has a particular signature in this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m31s)

[case uh get a numerator a move next and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m33s)

[a current that's it if your type has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m36s)

[those](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m39s)

[members C does not care what you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m40s)

[implement I enumerable happens to be a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m43s)

[convenient way to ensure that you've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m45s)

[implemented the needed members not by](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m47s)

[any means of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m49s)

[requirement so uh and I think I may have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m51s)

[misspoke there I think the four each](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m54s)

[actually needs the enumerator and then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m55s)

[the enumerator gives back uh the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h09m57s)

[individual matches I might have that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m00s)

[wrong regardless duct typing magical](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m02s)

[members things just work so when going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m05s)

[through and doing that just be aware if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m08s)

[you see a lot of people going VAR part](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m10s)

[of the reason is because that's an ugly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m11s)

[looking type and I don't want to look at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m13s)

[it generally we only use VAR when the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m15s)

[type is apparent and I would argue right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m17s)

[here the type is definitely not apparent](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m19s)

[but it also looks kind of ugly to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m21s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m23s)

[so um but the intent here is to really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m26s)

[force people if you say that you are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m29s)

[going to enumerate over the splits the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m30s)

[only thing you should do is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m33s)

[enumerate right the other thing that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m35s)

[comes into play here right is you'll](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m38s)

[note that this thing doesn't have link](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m40s)

[methods on it so you can't do like awar](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m43s)

[dot Etc like none of those things exist](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m45s)

[simply because this uh the link methods](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m49s)

[are all implemented on I inumerable](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m52s)

[right normally we think oh well we've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m54s)

[got a four each I can just do a DOT no](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h10m57s)

[no that's not how this works right you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m00s)

[end up doing something like this and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m02s)

[don't doubt somebody is going to go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m04s)

[through and write the relevant methods](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m06s)

[to convert this to an I inumerable](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m08s)

[but uh regardless are so that's all that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m11s)

[was missing so if you missed the talk](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m16s)

[that last night didn't get to get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m20s)

[because I was an idiot and missed these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m22s)

[two branches so once again uh new net9](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m26s)

[repo out underneath mine zah haah and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m29s)

[this sucker down uh okay so material](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m43s)

[design right I want to go back over here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m46s)

[I want to make sure because I think I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m49s)

[saw my stale](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m50s)

[flag uh yeah yeah see if no not stale](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m52s)

[knock it off knock it knock it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h11m58s)

[off knock it off we are going to keep](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m00s)

[this um don't care what you think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m03s)

[GitHub uh okay so last time we put out a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m07s)

[a build of my zaml Tes which was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m14s)

[functionally the thing that was slowing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m17s)

[us down on all of this we jump back over](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m19s)

[here what is going on with my master](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m24s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m26s)

[I want Master](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m29s)

[here okay and then if I look at numeric](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m33s)

[up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m35s)

[down be here okay this should be the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m36s)

[same](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m40s)

[PR yeah this guy here okay good good](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m41s)

[good we all in the happy place go back](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m44s)

[here so if I recall previously my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m48s)

[numeric up down tests were here and I I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m52s)

[got a little bit of a warning from one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m54s)

[of the other maintainers calling out](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m57s)

[that I may have an extra bug in here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h12m59s)

[that is worth checking so we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m01s)

[we're going to just double check this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m10s)

[okay and I want to find out where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m17s)

[the I was going to look and see here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m18s)

[what is blocking this because I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m21s)

[now there's numeric up down and then I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m25s)

[think there is decimal up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m29s)

[down right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m32s)

[uh oh did we end](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m35s)

[up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m38s)

[oh I may have broken this didn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m40s)

[I let me let me just take a little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m44s)

[Gander here at my test because I know we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m47s)

[were looking at uh this was the line in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m51s)

[test base that was breaking me that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m53s)

[immediately got us into trouble so this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m56s)

[one here if I do this and I go here and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h13m59s)

[we go update new get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m03s)

[package and in this case I am interested](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m07s)

[in this include](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m11s)

[pre-release if this works we will go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m13s)

[and pop the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m16s)

[now I'm confused](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m30s)

[okay well what is going on here what is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m32s)

[going on here do I not have automated](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m36s)

[deployment](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m41s)

[let's D we'll test four open PRS I got a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m44s)

[lot of open PRS thought we took care of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m47s)

[a bunch of these last time uh let's see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m49s)

[so dependent bot ones some of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m52s)

[merge fing is gener test base great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m53s)

[great great great uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h14m57s)

[um push](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m00s)

[Nate yeah yeah that that version right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m06s)

[there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m09s)

[nugate i' the uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m10s)

[yeah should be a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m14s)

[thing why why you why why you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m17s)

[dumb uh let's see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m21s)

[here check and what do I have in my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m25s)

[package P](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m28s)

[ages](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m31s)

[oh you push PR branches before merch no](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m33s)

[no no no that would be a horrible](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m37s)

[horrible thing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m39s)

[um uh but you you make a good point and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m43s)

[I I'm realizing what I what I've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m46s)

[probably done is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m48s)

[bad uh because I have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m53s)

[probably made a mistake on my deployment](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h15m57s)

[mechanism this is what happens when you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m00s)

[have like three different ways of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m02s)

[deploying stuff and you can't remember](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m04s)

[what you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m05s)

[do okay so we've got that pass to ignore](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m07s)

[pull requests blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m11s)

[uh but if we come down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m14s)

[here right so we very intentionally](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m17s)

[strip](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m19s)

[outs from from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m20s)

[uploading same with the pushing of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m24s)

[Nate uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m27s)

[um uh it's almost looks like the push](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m31s)

[occurs before the auto merge well but in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m33s)

[this case the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m36s)

[push uh would still have to go to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m38s)

[the master Branch so any push to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m41s)

[master Branch triggers but the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m43s)

[important part here is the new get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m46s)

[version and my V base version here is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m49s)

[set to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m53s)

[1.0 and 1.0 is actually less than my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m54s)

[published version](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m58s)

[which is what is biting me I think the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h16m59s)

[reason it isn't showing up properly is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m02s)

[because I have never updated my base](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m05s)

[version yeah so you'll knowe](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m10s)

[1.2.1 but then I've got this guy my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m13s)

[preview release here so effectively my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m16s)

[base version needs an update so that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m19s)

[fine we can we're going to bump that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m23s)

[real quick and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m25s)

[then in theory what should be happening](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m27s)

[is I should be bumping my base](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m29s)

[for uh wants to sign in with GitHub let](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m31s)

[me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m35s)

[in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m42s)

[yeah oh it's because the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m44s)

[extension yeah apparently I have not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m52s)

[done this in a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m55s)

[while come on figure figure yourself out](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h17m57s)

[I just I want to edit a file right I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m00s)

[just want this to be two two what it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m02s)

[going to end up being then in this case](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m06s)

[we are just going to straight Cowboy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m09s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m11s)

[in let's see bumping](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m13s)

[base the nice part though is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m16s)

[uh trying to commit oh create a new](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m20s)

[brand fine uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m23s)

[I go back and forth](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m28s)

[on whether I like having to do that or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m32s)

[not boom](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m36s)

[okay um I do wish there was an easier](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m41s)

[way for me to jump back to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m44s)

[repository this should have the one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m49s)

[change great and I am intentionally](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m51s)

[going do and then this should enable](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m55s)

[auto merge but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h18m57s)

[bo bo boom okay Off to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m00s)

[Races okay um we still haven't gotten](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m03s)

[back to the source generator bit but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m06s)

[that will be a different problem for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m08s)

[later but for now we know the version](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m09s)

[that got published we can just plug that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m11s)

[in directly and we are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m14s)

[going we will do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m18s)

[that okay so that will that will make a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m22s)

[difference plugging in the wrong version](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m25s)

[yeah yeah the autom merge will soci](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m33s)

[success even if it's skipped and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m34s)

[honestly I go around and round on what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m37s)

[the the best deployment](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m39s)

[mechanism I I've kind of come to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m41s)

[conclusion that I like a value inside of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m44s)

[my repository than relying on it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m48s)

[something like a git](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m50s)

[tag like I want I I think the best that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m52s)

[I've come up with is I want to change](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m56s)

[something that's checked into Source](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h19m59s)

[control that controls my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m01s)

[version or at least the base three](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m03s)

[digits I don't mind that the the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m05s)

[fourth c one is autogenerated that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m08s)

[doesn't bother](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m10s)

[me um simply because I like having that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m12s)

[history available to me and I like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m15s)

[having to approve the version changes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m17s)

[that kind of when you do it as a git tag](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m19s)

[it's outside the repository and it feels](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m22s)

[weird right like it's it's a it's not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m24s)

[that mutable but it's enough mutable](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m27s)

[that it bothers me but I would also like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m29s)

[my pipeline to Jen the tag for me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m32s)

[because sometimes it's really nice when](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m34s)

[looking at the repository especially](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m36s)

[when you're looking at the releases and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m39s)

[the tags and having those things go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m40s)

[together so rather than having the tag](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m42s)

[be the trigger I think I want the tag to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m44s)

[be the result but I I I go round and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m45s)

[round on what is best right so it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m48s)

[like okay and we know we should have the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m53s)

[new one because we have numeric up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m56s)

[and decimal up down as well right so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m57s)

[both of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h20m59s)

[guys the fact that it's now compiling is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m01s)

[probably a good thing but I was also](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m04s)

[cautioned that there may be an issue](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m06s)

[around I go in and look at the analyzers](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m10s)

[that the test generator wasn't running](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m15s)

[properly but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m18s)

[hello I it it it no it no go when I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m33s)

[clicky](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m37s)

[clicky that that that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m38s)

[is not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m41s)

[normal that gives me pause but I also](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m44s)

[didn't restart Visual Studio after](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m46s)

[cowboying in that version change so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m49s)

[we're going to do that first before I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m51s)

[get too carried away](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m52s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m55s)

[uh let's see I did autocomplete that PR](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h21m59s)

[right uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m05s)

[see pole request yeah autoc complete set](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m07s)

[so it it should](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m12s)

[go excellent so at least now the the new](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m13s)

[preview builds will actually hit the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m16s)

[right base](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m18s)

[version and part of me wants to have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m24s)

[actions that check to make sure that you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m26s)

[know my re when I'm publishing a preview](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m28s)

[version it's newer than what the release](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m31s)

[one is out there like there's cases](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m32s)

[where you don't want that like people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m34s)

[have old and new things going and so it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m36s)

[doesn't work for everybody but for the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m38s)

[simple case which is what most of my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m41s)

[stuff is kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m43s)

[nice okay so this gets us to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m47s)

[here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m51s)

[um want to double check and make sure we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m54s)

[actually see something in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h22m57s)

[here here we go saml test editor](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m01s)

[generated a bunch of stuff right so we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m04s)

[have the up down base in 32](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m07s)

[decimal okay so the two the generic](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m13s)

[bases are now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m16s)

[working um which makes me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m18s)

[happy down base and then the generic and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m24s)

[then it doesn't bother to generate more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m27s)

[than that because that's those are the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m28s)

[differences if we go through and look at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m32s)

[numeric up down right so a refresher for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m35s)

[people who may have forgotten there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m38s)

[is uh numeric up down which deres from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m41s)

[up down base two which I think we're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m45s)

[going to be renaming here in just a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m47s)

[moment and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m50s)

[then uh up down base which actually is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m52s)

[the the control itself and the necessity](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m56s)

[of the generic comes from needy to abuse](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h23m59s)

[this arithmetic why did I not why did I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m02s)

[not just I leave the two on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m06s)

[there fix that while we're in here that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m08s)

[just looks dumb that looks dumb](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m11s)

[okay because we have the use net 8 or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m17s)

[greater so the other thing that I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m20s)

[people sometimes forget so I have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m23s)

[conditional code here right that is you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m25s)

[know if net 8 if not net 8 so one is of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m27s)

[using newer uh generic math stuff this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m30s)

[little drop down up here in the top](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m34s)

[right hand corner Visual Studio when](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m36s)

[you've got a multi-targeted project this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m37s)

[lets you pick which state you're in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m39s)

[right so am I looking at the net 6](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m41s)

[compilation am I looking at the net 8](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m43s)

[compilation the 462 so especially when](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m45s)

[you have like pound ifs sometimes you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m47s)

[know when you're working inside of it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m49s)

[it's kind of nice to take a look at what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m51s)

[it what that one is right because even](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m53s)

[though it's one code file I've got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m55s)

[multiple outputs so so if we were to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m57s)

[look at the the bin directory I end up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h24m58s)

[with uh at least three separate dlls one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m02s)

[for each of the target Frameworks you'll](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m05s)

[also hear me call them tfm's Target](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m08s)

[framework moniker it just means the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m10s)

[name of the target](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m13s)

[framework so it not it's not fancy okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m15s)

[so did we write](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m20s)

[any we did](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m21s)

[not um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m25s)

[I think we're going to change this up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m30s)

[down controls because I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m31s)

[put them all here together and I kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m33s)

[want the test to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m35s)

[reflect](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m39s)

[the the hierarchy because we can do we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m41s)

[can do a similar polymorphic type](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m44s)

[approach here um because in all of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m46s)

[tests we're we're kind of going to be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m49s)

[doing the same same type of thing so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m51s)

[let's do uh public class](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m54s)

[up down control test and actually let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h25m59s)

[just grab this whole sucker here and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m04s)

[we're gonna we're going to genericize](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m07s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m09s)

[out we we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m10s)

[can paste go up to the top up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m12s)

[down roll test do that do that do that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m18s)

[great and then we're going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m21s)

[to um move you to a different type great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m23s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m27s)

[this guy here also now needs to be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m29s)

[abstract because we're going to do some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m31s)

[fancy stuff with it uh and specifically](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m33s)

[I want him to be T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m36s)

[control and I want to limit the T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m39s)

[control move down here where T control](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m42s)

[derives from uh up down base right so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m45s)

[we're just going to straight up put a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m50s)

[limitation on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m53s)

[that that way we can get cuz I don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m55s)

[want numeric up down here I want to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h26m58s)

[up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m01s)

[base or no no no no no no I want to do T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m02s)

[control here and this will](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m05s)

[be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m09s)

[interesting um because now I have to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m13s)

[something interesting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m16s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m18s)

[do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m22s)

[this and then we're going to do this and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m24s)

[we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m27s)

[go uh type of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m29s)

[control uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m34s)

[name I'm pausing here because we're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m36s)

[doing now we're taking a control name](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m38s)

[and putting it as a string to be able to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m40s)

[go through and pull this back now get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m43s)

[value gets interesting because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m45s)

[think the value only comes from the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m48s)

[generic let's see Min value max value](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h27m56s)

[Tri parse collapse this is value](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m00s)

[actually up on the yep min max all of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m04s)

[these things live up on the generic I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m08s)

[might have to get a little fancier](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m11s)

[here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m14s)

[um uh T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m17s)

[value not sure if this is actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m33s)

[yeah because now we have to we have to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m36s)

[effectively](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m40s)

[duplicate this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m42s)

[here uh where T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m45s)

[value is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m49s)

[that um but this is going to get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m54s)

[interesting because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h28m57s)

[believe let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m03s)

[see one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m05s)

[wants oh boy so we're going to have this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m07s)

[is this is going to get fun pound if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m09s)

[net8 or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m12s)

[greater and if right so we can do this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m17s)

[using](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m21s)

[numer uh this goes inside pound](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m23s)

[if uh net a or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m26s)

[greater and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m30s)

[if this will get that much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m32s)

[going uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m36s)

[see that'll fix that up and at least for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m42s)

[this we aren't cross compiling our UI](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m47s)

[tests trying to decide how much I care](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m53s)

[to do this and how much I I I want want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m56s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m58s)

[something more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h29m59s)

[clever because now this numeric up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m05s)

[down should be T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m08s)

[control which should have get value on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m12s)

[it the thing is is I could also solve](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m18s)

[this with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m20s)

[abstracts might be cleaner than trying](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m22s)

[to fight with this here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m24s)

[might be cleaner than trying to redo it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m35s)

[yeah because this is going to get ugly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m38s)

[fast let's not let's not go down this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m39s)

[route I want to I want to keep these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m41s)

[test easy because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m43s)

[this is an open source project and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m46s)

[need other people to help maintain this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m48s)

[so I can't we we can't get too clever so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m50s)

[let's let's change this up cuz there's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m53s)

[another option here right so protect Ed](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h30m59s)

[abstract uh T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m01s)

[value uh get value](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m03s)

[uh do an i visual element of T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m07s)

[control uh element](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m13s)

[or visual element all right so that gets](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m17s)

[me into there that gets me into there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m19s)

[that closes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m21s)

[that um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m23s)

[yeah I do want to do T](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m32s)

[value Wonder bad is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m35s)

[this because what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m43s)

[increment up and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m45s)

[down we want to share this code because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m49s)

[the other thing is we could just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m51s)

[duplicate this is it worth duplication](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m52s)

[increase and decrease value should we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h31m58s)

[duplicate because the what are we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m00s)

[actually sharing these elements](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m03s)

[here everything else the and the get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m07s)

[text call that's all we're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m10s)

[sharing I think I just decided we're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m13s)

[abandoning](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m15s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m17s)

[um but we are going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m20s)

[to little differently](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m25s)

[so one of the things that you will hear](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m29s)

[people mention is the concept of dry do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m32s)

[not repeat yourself and this gets](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m35s)

[drilled into a lot of people's heads](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m37s)

[where you should not ever repeat](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m39s)

[yourself and in general that makes a lot](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m41s)

[of sense however it's important to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m44s)

[understand where coding rules come from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m46s)

[and the reason for them because most](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m49s)

[rules are actually guidelines and can be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m52s)

[broken as long as you understand the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m56s)

[reason for the rule um and the and the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h32m58s)

[pros and cons of breaking it because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m02s)

[sometimes you just need to get something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m04s)

[done](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m06s)

[um in this case the the idea of do not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m08s)

[repeat yourself comes from the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m11s)

[premise of you don't want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m14s)

[to have to go make edits](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m17s)

[later um in multiple places it's a very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m20s)

[easy way to get yourself uh bit in a lot](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m23s)

[of cases](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m27s)

[where if you have duplicated stuff in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m28s)

[multiple places in addition to being](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m31s)

[confusing if it ever needs to be updated](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m32s)

[it will be problematic however the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m35s)

[other the thing to be aware of is that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m38s)

[in some cases if things are going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m41s)

[update at different rates duplication is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m44s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m46s)

[desirable uh over over not duplicating](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m48s)

[Izzy welcome back we are finishing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m52s)

[hopefully finishing up that numeric up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m55s)

[down Pull Quest that we fixed the zaml](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h33m57s)

[test for last time so hopefully based](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m00s)

[upon the feedback I left myself from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m04s)

[months ago on the pr the only limiting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m06s)

[factor was getting the UI test working](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m09s)

[and the UI tests weren't working because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m11s)

[of zaml test so I think we're about to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m13s)

[run it and know here in a moment if this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m17s)

[is actually a full fix or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m19s)

[not and then we should be Off to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m22s)

[Races](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m25s)

[and I will be getting the YouTube video](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m28s)

[from last week posted](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m31s)

[because I ironically I got a new phone](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m33s)

[and that broke my YouTube publishing for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m37s)

[convoluted](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m41s)

[reasons uh it's what happens when you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m43s)

[have a publishing mechanism that is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m45s)

[heavily dependent on some really wacky](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m48s)

[stuff uh okay so UI](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m50s)

[tests we should hopefully have up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m54s)

[controls great okay so I want to run I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h34m58s)

[want to see all eight of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m01s)

[pass hopefully they're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m09s)

[simple we could probably add some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m15s)

[additional uh so might be a short stream](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m18s)

[then we will see we will see I I've got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m22s)

[a few other things I want to poke at but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m25s)

[there's a lot of material design stuff](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m28s)

[that's outstanding okay so that is done](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m29s)

[that appears to work good the other the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m33s)

[zaml test one merged um I think what I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m35s)

[going to do is I am going to merge this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m39s)

[PR](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m43s)

[with uh just the changes so let's do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m45s)

[this stage all changes uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m48s)

[updating with uh UI oh my head my big](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m52s)

[head is in the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m56s)

[updating](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h35m58s)

[UI](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m01s)

[test oh how about updating UI](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m03s)

[test uh dat new zaml test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m07s)

[Library um and then I think what I will](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m13s)

[do is I will kick a full release](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m15s)

[of daml test and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m17s)

[then now that we know that it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m21s)

[working uh which actually since the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m24s)

[other thing merged we can just do that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m26s)

[now so let's see the way we do this is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m29s)

[we create a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m33s)

[tag and how am I naming my tags V](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m35s)

[something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m38s)

[yeah great tag here so V](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m45s)

[1.2.2 and then we big head out of your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m46s)

[way push tag to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m51s)

[remote and Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m55s)

[okay so that will get that guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h36m58s)

[going um let's go back to the material](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m03s)

[design](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m06s)

[stuff uh updated with new test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m07s)

[Library big head to the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m12s)

[side uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m14s)

[see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m18s)

[added](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m20s)

[decimal up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m22s)

[down go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m24s)

[uh did](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m28s)

[I check what I done](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m31s)

[here uh have you ever had to have a Cort](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m35s)

[or SSH terminal in any app before I need](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m39s)

[to try and Implement](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m42s)

[both uh so I guess it depends on what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m44s)

[you mean Izzy I have built so at one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m47s)

[point in time I was working for a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m50s)

[company that was building industrial](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m52s)

[printers uh so these were printers that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m54s)

[printed](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m56s)

[um pcbs so printed circuit boards so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h37m58s)

[printers the size of my desk that could](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m01s)

[kill me which was great because of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m04s)

[lasers and fast and heavy things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m06s)

[moving um and a lot of the communication](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m08s)

[between the app and like say the stepper](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m11s)

[motors for driving the tables uh was via](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m14s)

[serial communication so I have done](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m17s)

[serial communication inside of like a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m19s)

[WPF app um I have never done like an SSH](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m21s)

[terminal unless you mean just like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m26s)

[opening up an SSH connection inside of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m29s)

[C I've never done but I can't imagine is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m33s)

[terribly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m35s)

[difficult okay so I would like to look](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m39s)

[at this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m41s)

[PR let's review code let's review code](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m48s)

[so everything y Okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m50s)

[so okay so main window view model we've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m56s)

[got a new documentation link for numeric](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h38m59s)

[decimal up down base that seems very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m03s)

[reasonable Let's see we have a decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m07s)

[up down showing the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m09s)

[steps the new unique key so the demo app](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m12s)

[seems](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m15s)

[fine we have a new licit style targeting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m17s)

[decimal up down right next to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m22s)

[numeric up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m24s)

[down great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m25s)

[um and it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m28s)

[is based on the same one that the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m30s)

[numeric up down one is probably](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m33s)

[okay okay and that numeric up down is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m38s)

[based upon up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m42s)

[base that seems](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m45s)

[fine a lot of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m49s)

[styles are just flowing from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m51s)

[that I am realizing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m55s)

[we should probably go and fix some of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h39m59s)

[these or at least](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m03s)

[provide duplication from the name](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m07s)

[because this is material design numeric](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m10s)

[up down which is fine but I think we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m13s)

[actually want the styles to follow the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m16s)

[base so we will check that okay uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m17s)

[desmal up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m21s)

[down looks fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m23s)

[straightforward though it still has up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m26s)

[down basee to so we need to go look at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m28s)

[that let's see make an app that can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m32s)

[Flash an image to an so and configure](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m35s)

[secure boot but that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m39s)

[processes 5050 RS 252 and SSH](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m41s)

[oh well that's interesting uh for people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m46s)

[who don't know it RS 252 is the seral](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m49s)

[port](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m52s)

[communication uh only viable UI is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m55s)

[feedback yeah and I will warn you serial](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h40m59s)

[communication](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m03s)

[is well so I was doing like I said](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m04s)

[stepper motor communication and it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m07s)

[was difficult](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m10s)

[like in my case there wasn't good](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m13s)

[feedback you could never be assured of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m15s)

[anything like the moment you start doing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m18s)

[stuff with Hardware it it becomes really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m20s)

[hard to do anything conclusively](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m23s)

[especially over](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m29s)

[cereal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m33s)

[yeah if you run into something specific](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m36s)

[Izzy and you've got a sample or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m38s)

[something you want to throw up let me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h41m40s)

[to debug this slightly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m04s)

[code I get it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m16s)

[no it must have cashed something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m20s)

[somewhere okay I'm I'm willing to bet I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m24s)

[was just cck on the draw that's I don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m26s)

[know how I got myself into that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m29s)

[situation okay well I'm sure I got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m31s)

[myself into that situation to start by](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m33s)

[update immediately after the push okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m37s)

[this is a situation where side by side](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m40s)

[diff is almost assuredly going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m42s)

[better okay um because there's all of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m46s)

[that and then most of that just gets](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m50s)

[delet yeah so up down base contains](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m53s)

[almost everything of interest and even](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h43m57s)

[though it shows is all net new it's not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m00s)

[that net new it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m02s)

[just great tools Manifest this is just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m05s)

[so that it shows up in the visual tool](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m09s)

[box](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m12s)

[okay build that test we created new](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m14s)

[tests and we know exactly how those](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m17s)

[worked that makes me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m19s)

[happy um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m22s)

[oo the Yonder Hornet not to distract but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m28s)

[and don't worry about distracting I love](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m31s)

[rabbit Trails especially for questions](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m33s)

[I've had some issues testing Entity](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m35s)

[framework core context do you have any](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m36s)

[docs that might help for testing EF core](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m39s)

[ah so yes but I'm going to premise](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m42s)

[preface them a little bit so it depends](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m46s)

[on what you're trying to accomplish with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m48s)

[so for example um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m53s)

[the framework core uh sqlite in memory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h44m58s)

[so a common pattern that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m03s)

[people thought there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m09s)

[was probably going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m12s)

[be yeah this and this are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m16s)

[probably what I'm expecting to I'm just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m21s)

[sorry I'm looking for something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m25s)

[yeah this this is this is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m28s)

[a so couple links coming coming at you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m30s)

[all at once and then before you just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m34s)

[blindly go and follow them I will I will](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m37s)

[issue some words of caution so SQL or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m40s)

[not um EF is inherently a leaky](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m43s)

[abstraction what I mean by that is you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m47s)

[have a DB context side of EF that you've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m49s)

[linked to a provider and each of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m53s)

[providers support slightly different](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h45m56s)

[things so one of the common testing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m00s)

[methods which is uh what this blog here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m04s)

[is calling out is to use an inmemory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m07s)

[database the advantages of an inmemory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m10s)

[database is it's quick it's fast um and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m12s)

[it will at least validate a minimum](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m17s)

[level of functionality for you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m20s)

[interacting with the um the DB context](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m21s)

[the problem being is is because it's a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m25s)

[leaky abstraction the moment you test uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m27s)

[DB context with a different provider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m31s)

[than what your real database is you're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m33s)

[only mostly confident that your code is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m35s)

[right because you can never be 100%](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m38s)

[certain that switching providers isn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m41s)

[going to have slightly different](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m43s)

[behavior and this is the why I say EF is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m44s)

[a leaky abstraction the moment you test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m48s)

[with a different provider you're not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m50s)

[confident even if I was to go through](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m52s)

[and um switch from like Ms SQL to um to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h46m55s)

[se uh to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m00s)

[mySQL even using EF I'm only mostly sure](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m02s)

[that it's going to work because I could](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m06s)

[have some raw SQL in there I could have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m08s)

[some other stuff but you know I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m10s)

[confident and oftentimes even with like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m12s)

[um here I'll even show you this like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m15s)

[velop Pac does this and this this this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m18s)

[portion of the repo is closed source so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m21s)

[sorry um don't worry one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m23s)

[I'm the owner and two uh I own it so we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m27s)

[can we can show this and my partner's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m32s)

[aware that I do this so it's okay I got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m35s)

[permission where's my test oh they're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m37s)

[under the test folder right so if I look](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m39s)

[at my API service tests and I look at my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m41s)

[down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m47s)

[here where is my web application Factory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m52s)

[yeah so inside of my web application](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h47m57s)

[Factory which is a class used to test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m00s)

[ASP net core controllers functionally um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m02s)

[I am spinning up a inmemory SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m05s)

[through and I am configuring it so that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m12s)

[I can leverage it with my test now my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m14s)

[tests do not use SQL light for the real](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m18s)

[production and I using Azure SQL as my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m21s)

[real one but I don't have anything](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m24s)

[fancy in any of my EF stuff so this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m27s)

[gives me a high degree of confidence](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m30s)

[that if this works it's going to work](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m33s)

[now in those links that I sent you there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m35s)

[are two call outs here and I'm hoping](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m38s)

[this blog post calls it out because it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m39s)

[shows the inmemory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m42s)

[provider right uh this thing is the next](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m43s)

[best thing to worthless uh this gives](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m47s)

[you no confidence because it by](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m49s)

[definition it says in memory it uses a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m52s)

[provider that's basically if you were to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m55s)

[back your database with lists of objects](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h48m57s)

[which gives you no confidence that your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m00s)

[link will be will convert to SQL if you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m02s)

[actually use the SQL iten memory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m05s)

[provider you at least have a level of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m07s)

[confidence that your link will convert](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m10s)

[to at least idiomatic SQL and the SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m13s)

[light in memory provider in general is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m16s)

[more restrictive than most other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m20s)

[providers for bigger database things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m22s)

[like Azure SQL supports more than what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m24s)

[sqlite does so typically when people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m27s)

[test with sqlite the limitation that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m30s)

[they run into is they've got something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m31s)

[that actually works with their real](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m33s)

[database but fails with SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m35s)

[light right so like one of the things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m38s)

[here you'll note I'm creating a function](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m40s)

[for current datetime offset because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m43s)

[leverage this the this Cy datetime](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m47s)

[offset but sqlite has no idea how to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m50s)

[that it just doesn't work so I actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m52s)

[have to go through and do some work to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m55s)

[register up a function to have SQL light](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m56s)

[support something that just doesn't work](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h49m59s)

[in SQL light and the reason it doesn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m02s)

[work is because this thing isn't or SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m05s)

[light doesn't have the same level of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m07s)

[precision so this is technically a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m08s)

[little bit off I don't care for my test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m10s)

[I'm just looking to have the a date time](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m13s)

[go in and have it be mildly close to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m15s)

[Accurate I don't care that it's not the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m17s)

[same level of precision as Azure SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m19s)

[that's not a concern I have that's why](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m22s)

[it's not built in and again this is one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m24s)

[of those it's it's not there and there's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m27s)

[a reason for it because they don't want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m28s)

[people getting shoot uh shooting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m30s)

[themselves in the foot because of lack](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m31s)

[of precision but for some of the testing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m33s)

[like this yeah it's perfectly fine so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m36s)

[one easy option for you is SQL Li in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m39s)

[memory so in a lot of cases that will be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m41s)

[sufficient to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m44s)

[test it in some cases it will not be and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m46s)

[the most likely case that you will run](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m49s)

[into is SQL light does not support](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m52s)

[something your actual database provider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m54s)

[does I don't know maybe you're building](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m56s)

[a a mobile app and sqlite is your target](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m57s)

[database in which case this is an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h50m59s)

[awesome solution right unit testing uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m01s)

[with ef when your target database](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m04s)

[actually is sqlite because you're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m07s)

[building like a mobile app great now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m08s)

[you've got an in-memory option that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m11s)

[the exact same provider as your real one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m12s)

[you're golden have fun sky the limit um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m14s)

[the other thing too um that that people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m19s)

[will do is they will they will abstract](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m22s)

[their DB context with a repository](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m25s)

[pattern so this is something that I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m27s)

[think got popularized with like domain](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m29s)

[driven design or similar where you do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m31s)

[something like this and this doesn't let](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m34s)

[you it doesn't give you a lot of good](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m37s)

[stuff to work with right like it doesn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m40s)

[let you test your database but it it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m43s)

[takes your database out of the test of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m45s)

[the rest of your app so it's like I get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m48s)

[Twitchy around this but it is a valid](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m52s)

[option that people go down let's see is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m54s)

[there any way to simply mock the DB](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m55s)

[context I have a simple DB so was really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h51m57s)

[struggling to mock the DB context](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m00s)

[regardless of the underlying Tech not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m03s)

[not reasonably um like you like kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m06s)

[like Izzy says you can you can mock your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m09s)

[DB context but it's generally not the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m11s)

[recommended option I would if I was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m14s)

[going to be mocking I would end up doing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m17s)

[something more akin to this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m19s)

[where uh the the easiest option is you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m23s)

[give your DB context uh a Constructor](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m25s)

[that takes in the options similar to how](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m29s)

[he is structured it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m31s)

[here uh new up the options with the SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m33s)

[light provider and then the rest of your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m36s)

[code just works like like it always has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m38s)

[and you don't need to change anything](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m42s)

[out the only thing that's different is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m43s)

[then in your real app the options that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m45s)

[get passed in are you know use Azure SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m47s)

[or whatever whatever provider you're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m51s)

[using under the hood to make it work so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m53s)

[rather than](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m55s)

[uh mocking because the the issue with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h52m57s)

[mocks is mocks introduce seams in your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m01s)

[code and the way I've described it to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m04s)

[other people in the past is it's kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m06s)

[like a plumber who who needs to run some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m08s)

[pipes right if you think of your app](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m10s)

[that way a SE your code is like a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m12s)

[fitting in that pipe and wherever you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m14s)

[get water leaks is typically right where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m17s)

[that fitting is however fittings allow](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m19s)

[you to like you know clear out clogs](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m22s)

[from smaller section rather than having](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m25s)

[to run the whole length of the pipe so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m27s)

[you want some fittings but you don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m29s)

[want too many because if you're if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m31s)

[you're if the entire run of your pipe is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m32s)

[just fitting fitting fitting fitting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m34s)

[fitting that's a recipe for leaks](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m36s)

[because you've got all of these possible](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m39s)

[leaky points](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m40s)

[so in general if you can avoid a seam in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m42s)

[your code with mock it's it's often](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m45s)

[times a little bit better uh isn't that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m47s)

[what DB factor is for when testing um so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m50s)

[if you're referring to the uh DB context](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m54s)

[Factory that is it is a way of letting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h53m57s)

[you create uh DB context on the fly so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m00s)

[uh context](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m09s)

[Factory um so yes if you are leveraging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m12s)

[DB context you can use this as testing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m15s)

[but this is really just uh Factory](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m19s)

[pattern around the DB context so it it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m21s)

[gives you an easy way of injecting it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m24s)

[but depending on what your code is it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m27s)

[means that the code leveraging it can't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m29s)

[take in uh a context directly it has to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m32s)

[take in a DB context Factory and call](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m34s)

[create context a lot of it uh with the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m36s)

[context Factory comes down to what type](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m39s)

[of app you're building and what kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m42s)

[Lifetime control you need over that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m44s)

[context because it's quite common for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m46s)

[context to be registered scoped and like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m49s)

[in an aspet core situation that's uh per](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m52s)

[request well sometimes you need to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m55s)

[actually say well I like I know that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h54m57s)

[that's what it is but I need to control](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m00s)

[this and um I need to either have my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m02s)

[context be transient or Singleton or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m06s)

[whatever so oftentimes when I see the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m08s)

[factory getting used it's because people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m10s)

[have more uh interesting scenarios for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m12s)

[managing lifetime than otherwise because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m16s)

[the simplest thing is just to take in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m18s)

[the context and and act on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m20s)

[that and that's that's generally where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m23s)

[the the path at least but yeah if if you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m26s)

[are leveraging the context Factory for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m29s)

[something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m31s)

[great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m34s)

[yeah Yonder Hornet let me know if that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m36s)

[if that answerers your question like I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m38s)

[said I think my my recommendation to you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m40s)

[wouldn't be to mock the context directly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m43s)

[but to do something with the options uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m45s)

[and indirectly handle it from the inside](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m49s)

[a similar thing can be done with like um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m53s)

[HTTP client as well where you don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m55s)

[actually mock HTTP client but instead](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h55m57s)

[you you either mock or substitute the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m01s)

[Handler inside of it to control the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m03s)

[requests which is a a slightly better](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m06s)

[way of of handling things because then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m09s)

[your code continues to use HTTP client](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m11s)

[is fat dumb and happy and has no idea](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m13s)

[when the requests don't actually hit the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m15s)

[network um EF is kind of the same way](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m17s)

[rather than mocking the the DB context](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m20s)

[you mock or replace](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m24s)

[the provider that it's using under the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m26s)

[hood and then the rest of your code](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m29s)

[continues to to operate on the regular](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m31s)

[DB context and has no idea that the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m33s)

[underlying pattern has been swapped out](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m35s)

[so it's very similar to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m37s)

[like dependency injection with your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m40s)

[Constructor parameters it's just that uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m43s)

[you're one level](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m46s)

[deeper yeah I think that does answer my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m47s)

[question I'll have to implement to see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m50s)

[if it works cool and like I said it a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m51s)

[lot of it depends a little bit on your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m53s)

[application and what you're doing but if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m55s)

[you aren't doing anything fancy sqlite](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m57s)

[in memory is generally what people do in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h56m59s)

[a lot of cases I do have some colleagues](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m02s)

[that have some interesting cases where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m06s)

[the SQL light in memory was very much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m09s)

[not sufficient um and so they do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m11s)

[something a little close to more like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m15s)

[integration testing and so they they](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m17s)

[spin a DB um as a Docker container up as](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m19s)

[part of their their pipeline runs and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m24s)

[then they have all of the tests pounding](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m27s)

[on a a legit database instance now it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m29s)

[in a container that they're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m32s)

[throw away at the end of the pipeline](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m33s)

[run but they have a legit database](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m35s)

[instance to go and pound on and it is a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m37s)

[little more integration test rather than](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m38s)

[unit test but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m40s)

[um yeah uh inm sqlite caused me issues](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m44s)

[but can't recall why yeah the the big](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m48s)

[ones that I'm aware of are around like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m49s)

[datetime offsets um those are a common](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m52s)

[one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m55s)

[one more that I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m56s)

[what it is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h57m58s)

[um where in in a lot of cases we end up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m00s)

[doing the the Define function](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m03s)

[approach right where you where you uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m06s)

[leverage this um I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m09s)

[remember there's one more there's one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m12s)

[more that I've hit that's a common](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m14s)

[limitation in SQL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m16s)

[light um and I think I remember right uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m18s)

[SQL light EF core](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m23s)

[limitations I think they're actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m27s)

[they're actually document right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m29s)

[here where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m32s)

[limitations oh decimal yeah that's the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m35s)

[other one that bites this guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m38s)

[here yeah so this is this is the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m47s)

[one and if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m50s)

[you uh let's see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m51s)

[here so the the key thing here is the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m54s)

[function mapping is the one right below](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m57s)

[this so if you if you need to actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h58m59s)

[end up mapping some functions there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m01s)

[there are some call outs here of how to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m03s)

[how to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m05s)

[it those two there might be useful links](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m07s)

[for you again like SQL light generally](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m10s)

[is more restrictive than any other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m13s)

[provider that you're using so you should](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m15s)

[be fine if it passes with SQL light it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m18s)

[just that sometimes people get really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m21s)

[really frustrated with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m22s)

[it okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m24s)

[think what I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m27s)

[decided oh I don't think I want to leave](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m29s)

[this in emit compiler generated files I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m32s)

[think what I want to do though is I want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m34s)

[this so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m37s)

[often I want this so often I think I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m38s)

[going to leave it commented out I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m41s)

[I'm G to leave it there but just comment](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m43s)

[it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m45s)

[out uh let's see that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m46s)

[fine this is now no longer fine because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m50s)

[my um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m54s)

[um my thing deployed so if I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=00h59m57s)

[refresh look at that 15 minutes ago I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m02s)

[win](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m05s)

[um now if I come back over](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m08s)

[here uh I don't want to I don't want to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m11s)

[do those I want to actually edit the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m14s)

[file I don't want to suggest changes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m15s)

[we're not we're not suggesting changes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m17s)

[we are straight pushing this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m19s)

[sucker there so we want this guy and we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m24s)

[want latest version because zaml test](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m28s)

[was largely built for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m31s)

[uh for this Library yeah Yonder let me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m34s)

[know if you've got more questions feel](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m38s)

[free to drop them in again I don't mind](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m39s)

[rabbit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m41s)

[trailing uh let's see so Iz some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m42s)

[providers handle collections in enums](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m45s)

[differently so you need may need to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m46s)

[something to be consistent if that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m48s)

[required uh yes that is very true I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h00m50s)

[it and we force push we don't think we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h01m42s)

[just okay so that guy is now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h01m46s)

[it to run because it's coming from an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h01m59s)

[outside fork and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m03s)

[then enable auto merge okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m06s)

[should roll this guy is going into 52](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m09s)

[this guy is going to be labeled with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m13s)

[release](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m15s)

[notes so that it shows up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m18s)

[there then we should probably put it as](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m22s)

[those just want see I I I I knew I was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m39s)

[forgetting something let's see numeric](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m43s)

[up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m45s)

[down these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m46s)

[guys okay so the idea here is I don't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m50s)

[want to remove style keys because Style](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m53s)

[di Keys would be a breaking change and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m55s)

[that is that is for later but I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h02m58s)

[what might be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m00s)

[nice because right now if somebody](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m02s)

[wanted to use say the filled Style with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m05s)

[the the decimal one there is no easy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m08s)

[style here to to leverage](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m11s)

[um material](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m15s)

[design](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m17s)

[build I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m20s)

[is up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m24s)

[base actually maybe what I should do is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m27s)

[I should actually copy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m29s)

[this we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m31s)

[go we're going to create we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m34s)

[create just a couple overloads for each](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m36s)

[of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m38s)

[these that end up working that way there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m39s)

[is uh easy overrides for people who want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m44s)

[them all right so this then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m51s)

[becomes uh Target](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m54s)

[Type X Type](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h03m57s)

[WPF and this is going to be numeric Up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m00s)

[Down based](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m04s)

[on uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m07s)

[see that is 100% wrong](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m09s)

[co-pilot thanks for nothing uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m12s)

[see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m16s)

[build down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m18s)

[base that goes like that that goes like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m23s)

[that that goes like that right and so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m25s)

[this then changes from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m27s)

[numeric to up down base because the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m29s)

[style key still exists it will work for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m32s)

[people who already have it even though](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m35s)

[the numeric up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m37s)

[control uh so when is 52 schu release](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m40s)

[scheduled see the problem is is you're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m43s)

[assuming that I operate on a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m46s)

[schedule](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m48s)

[uh frankly I I really just um releas](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m50s)

[when I when I think that it is ready um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m56s)

[and some people get a little Twitchy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h04m59s)

[about the the preview releases and I get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m01s)

[it some companies don't like preview](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m04s)

[releases their scene is bad I get it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m06s)

[that that's kind of okay um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m09s)

[the but with that said it's 52 starting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m13s)

[to get enough stuff in it I probably](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m17s)

[just kick the button have it go because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m18s)

[it's not actually that hard for me to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m20s)

[release like the pipeline does I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m22s)

[like 95% of the work for me now the only](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m25s)

[thing I end up having to do is write up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m28s)

[like it'll gen the release notes but I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m31s)

[always have to go through and edit a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m33s)

[little bit like because it's Jing them](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m34s)

[from the issues in the PRS so I can't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m37s)

[really fault it for not generating](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m40s)

[perfectly because sometimes things just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m41s)

[they don't look quite](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m44s)

[right okay so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m47s)

[here that goes like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m51s)

[that yeah so probably not that far](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m53s)

[and really in a lot of cases I I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h05m57s)

[people can use the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m01s)

[um hand leverage the preview builds in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m07s)

[in a lot of situations like if there is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m11s)

[a killer feature from 52 that somebody's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m12s)

[really eager to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m15s)

[have it's not like the preview builds go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m16s)

[through some sort of different quality](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m19s)

[gate the only difference is how much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m21s)

[esting that I've had to on them because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m23s)

[I'm often running the preview builds](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m26s)

[myself um just as a way of trying to put](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m28s)

[them through their](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m31s)

[paces and I do see other downloads of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m36s)

[them as well so I know some people do do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m39s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m41s)

[them now I just got to make sure](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m42s)

[I decimal up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m45s)

[down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m48s)

[format okay so let's see filled numeric](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m52s)

[and this is why I have to watch myself](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m58s)

[because thought I'd messed that up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h06m59s)

[somewhere filled up down base up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m01s)

[base that goes there base type up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m04s)

[base this one here up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m08s)

[base that's fine numeric decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m12s)

[decimal okay so there is outlined there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m18s)

[is filled both](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m20s)

[handled and then I think all I need to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m23s)

[do is the basic](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m26s)

[one let's see there's filled I'm just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m30s)

[going to use a little white space to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m32s)

[make this a little more obvious for me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m34s)

[uh let's see floating](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m36s)

[hint there's a question of how many of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m43s)

[these are worth](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m45s)

[having okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m49s)

[so go here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m53s)

[down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m56s)

[base down base this becomes numeric up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h07m58s)

[down this flips to the base](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m04s)

[one then we self](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m07s)

[close delete all this garbage and copy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m10s)

[this paste it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m19s)

[decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m21s)

[go decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m23s)

[okay so that is the floating up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m27s)

[down this one is just the basic one so I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m32s)

[don't need separate ones for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m36s)

[it just those](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m39s)

[three](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m41s)

[okay check our work real](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m44s)

[quick make sure that I haven't done](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m48s)

[anything horribly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m50s)

[bad that's just a formatting with a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m52s)

[rename game oh the formatting is going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m55s)

[to make my](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m57s)

[life off](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h08m59s)

[white don't care about the formatting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m03s)

[just going to ignore](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m06s)

[it okay so up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m10s)

[base numeric up down numeric up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m14s)

[decimal down base up down base decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m19s)

[deal okay this one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m22s)

[it's base on end of it this is going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m26s)

[numeric numeric up down base decimal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m30s)

[decimal up down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m33s)

[base base on the end numeric numeric up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m35s)

[down base decimal decimal up down base](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m44s)

[great stage once again we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m45s)

[pretend like there was no mistake I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m48s)

[don't see a mistake there was nothing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m50s)

[there nothing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m51s)

[there send it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h09m53s)

[okay now we'll turn the auto merge back](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m00s)

[on okay so that gets that out of the way](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m02s)

[let's go and look](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m05s)

[here uh Nikolai had a one in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m07s)

[here're going to prioritize Nikolai](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m12s)

[because he is one of the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m14s)

[maintainers uh let's see different](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m19s)

[background](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m22s)

[okay so let's see vix is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m26s)

[3710 uh let's see a new way of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m29s)

[controlling the background of the hint](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m31s)

[for the outline style it broke the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m34s)

[styles uh not being thorough in manual](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m36s)

[testing this is this is the hard part](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m38s)

[with the theme library is does it look](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m41s)

[right is a really hard thing to unit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m44s)

[test uh let's see introduces a new API](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m46s)

[to support the attached property in the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m49s)

[only be used in the outline](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h10m53s)

[explicitly said the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m03s)

[a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m08s)

[look let's see apply hint padding brush](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m10s)

[false that all seems fine](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m21s)

[okay let's see it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m25s)

[us okay so this is going to be a little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m28s)

[interesting because I'm going to have to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m30s)

[be remembering a bit back on the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m32s)

[PR of what was actually because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m35s)

[this fly hint padding](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m40s)

[brush I will say at some point on this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m46s)

[stream we are going to end up doing some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m48s)

[avalonia because my day job I have been](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m50s)

[doing quite a bit of avalonia work and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m53s)

[have thoroughly enjoyed myself](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h11m58s)

[avalonia is a wonderful zaml based](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m01s)

[framework there are a few things I have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m06s)

[not enjoyed with it are very minor in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m09s)

[compared to the things that I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m12s)

[love uh let's just one thing really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m16s)

[quick I want to grab the poll request](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m19s)

[PR and let's just run this sucker real](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m33s)

[quick because I want to I just want to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m37s)

[see it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m38s)

[run the the hard part is the Smart hint](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m40s)

[is a control that is used to to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m44s)

[basically show like The Floating hints](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m46s)

[side of text boxes combo Boxes Etc the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m49s)

[the real big disadvantage is it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m52s)

[not um because it's a kind of a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h12m56s)

[foundational piece so many controls it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m00s)

[difficult to thoroughly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m04s)

[test but there's a nice one in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m07s)

[here Fields](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m11s)

[lineup um that has quite a few of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m14s)

[options](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m17s)

[available um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m20s)

[doesn't fully show](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m25s)

[the right so we can test a couple of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m29s)

[these but I don't think any of them are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m32s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m33s)

[break here I wouldn't expect them](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m35s)

[to testing a little bit sure Nikolai has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m46s)

[probably done significantly more testing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m50s)

[than what I'm likely to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m52s)

[very good at this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m55s)

[but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m57s)

[that he's also very good about if there](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h13m59s)

[is areas to look](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m04s)

[at that sucker that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m07s)

[in okay uh let's see using fre let's so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m11s)

[I'm I'm kind of picking these uh at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m16s)

[random a little bit but I also am aware](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m18s)

[that some of these are good now this one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m21s)

[here I believe was somebody doing it for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m24s)

[hacktober Fest which is fine um he wrote](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m26s)

[a decent amount of documentation and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m29s)

[shoved it into the docs folder which is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m31s)

[good I I appreciate this and I've been](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m34s)

[mostly just checking to make sure it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m36s)

[correct some of it is duplicating a lot](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m38s)

[of what it's in the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m40s)

[docs Which is less beneficial but at the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m44s)

[same time it's also useful docs and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m47s)

[see that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m50s)

[people um end up looking looking here as](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m51s)

[well so it's like h i i i him and hod](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m55s)

[but you know what it's a docs page with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h14m59s)

[a markdown file uh we need a guide to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m00s)

[migrate to avalonia Izzy stand by he's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m03s)

[coming um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m08s)

[specifically the one of the biggest](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m10s)

[things that I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m12s)

[see so one if if you have a big WPF](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m13s)

[investment and you want to go to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m17s)

[avalonia and your company is willing to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m19s)

[pay money um avalonia has poed](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m21s)

[uh WPF to like mac so if it's like oh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m26s)

[like cuz one of the questions is why go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m31s)

[to avalonia right uh if it's to get some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m33s)

[of the newer syntax stuff that's kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m36s)

[cool because they've got they've got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m39s)

[some really cool stuff that's built in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m41s)

[like they've got Snoop built into your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m43s)

[app on debug builds you press F12 it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m45s)

[very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m48s)

[slick](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m49s)

[um let's go ahead and grab some of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m51s)

[double check them](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m53s)

[um and and things of that nature the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m55s)

[biggest limitation that I see is they](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h15m58s)

[are a nice cross-platform framework but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m00s)

[they're only a UI framework and they're](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m02s)

[Unapologetic about it like they want to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m04s)

[be a very good performance multiplatform](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m07s)

[UI framework which is great and the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m11s)

[problem is is the moment you say well I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m13s)

[want this and that that's crossplatform](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m14s)

[they go that's not our problem right go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m16s)

[pull in something like Maui Essentials](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m19s)

[or similar if you want some of the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m21s)

[backing controls because that's not an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m22s)

[issue that we care to address which I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m25s)

[get but it also leaves](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m27s)

[people like un my mind at least people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m30s)

[without a good W path forward because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m34s)

[they haven't brought those things in now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m36s)

[I'm slowly adding to my template because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m39s)

[my opinion is the way to fix this is a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m42s)

[good starting project template that has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m43s)

[all of those pieces kind of brought](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m45s)

[together](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m47s)

[great um there's also somebody has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m48s)

[ported the material design in zaml](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m51s)

[library to avalonia which has been great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m53s)

[I've been very happy to see it um it's a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m56s)

[slightly older 4X version of the library](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h16m58s)

[that got ported but the author has been](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m01s)

[very receptive because I've been](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m03s)

[submitting issues and similar and I owe](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m05s)

[him some PRS because I offered to update](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m07s)

[a handful of things for him that like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m09s)

[either got missed when he brought it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m12s)

[over or similar but it's it's made me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m14s)

[feel at home I I I see it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m17s)

[there been great](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m21s)

[so I will say the the person who did](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m25s)

[this was very good at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m28s)

[markdown like I hadn't actually seen](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m30s)

[this tip thing before inside a markdown](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m32s)

[for um GitHub and I didn't know that it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m34s)

[worked but I tested it does it's kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m38s)

[cool but like even these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m40s)

[tables like there's a decent amount of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m43s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m46s)

[here um there's there's a nice touch and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m47s)

[I like this may not be obvious to a lot](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m51s)

[of people who look look at these links](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m53s)

[and go okay they're links to some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m55s)

[Microsoft docs but there's a subtle](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m56s)

[change that that's been done to these if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h17m58s)

[we copy the link if I take this link and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m02s)

[I go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m06s)

[here right there's a there's a key](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m08s)

[change up here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m10s)

[right this do this right this little bit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m13s)

[right here n](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m17s)

[us right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m20s)

[uh there sorry got my colors](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m25s)

[wrong thisen us it TXS in The Language](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m32s)

[by for the mic for Microsoft links you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m36s)

[can delete the language out of the URL](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m38s)

[and then your link uh if it's sent to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m41s)

[somebody whose language isn't English or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m43s)

[whatever English you viewed it in it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m46s)

[will use the the browsers local to try](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m48s)

[to look up an appropriate language for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m50s)

[them so when I'm putting links in I of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m52s)

[often times will try to drop the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m54s)

[language portion of it because I want](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m57s)

[people clicking on it to get whatever](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h18m58s)

[language they have set because English](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m00s)

[is my language but it may not be theirs](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m02s)

[so the fact that there was at least](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m04s)

[like whoever did this put some put a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m06s)

[level of effort](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m10s)

[into um doing this and I think iub](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m12s)

[changed you check box used to stay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m15s)

[pinned to the top and I'm a little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m17s)

[annoyed that it doesn't right now um but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m19s)

[it was there's actually been cleanup of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m22s)

[the links and similar so it's like this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m24s)

[is kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m26s)

[nice so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m29s)

[yeah the doc](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m33s)

[panel yeah like again the information](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m35s)

[here I believe um resembles what's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m38s)

[inside of the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m41s)

[docs uh approv and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m43s)

[run enable auto merge enable auto merge](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m46s)

[and I I realized it was somebody just I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m50s)

[think just going through trying to get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m52s)

[their hacked over fests](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m54s)

[in and like there was an open issue that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h19m56s)

[I had out there for for doing some of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m01s)

[these dock related things I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m02s)

[they've gone a little beyond what was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m04s)

[initially originally asked for but it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m06s)

[not bad kind of okay keeping because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m08s)

[also don't expect that these docks are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m12s)

[ever going to really need a ton of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m14s)

[updates given how stable WPF is they](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m17s)

[don't really change that much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m20s)

[and it also gives me a nice thing to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m31s)

[link](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m33s)

[to well so that's kind of convenient](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m34s)

[there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m37s)

[things um it's important to note that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m49s)

[this says list View I might need to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m52s)

[double check this I think data grid has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m55s)

[virtualization on by](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h20m58s)

[default uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m00s)

[WPF rols](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m02s)

[with is there is a table in the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m05s)

[docs this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m09s)

[page](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m12s)

[that yeah okay so list](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m15s)

[view can be enabled okay okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m19s)

[um it doesn't say for data grid h i i i](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m24s)

[i would assume datag grids on by](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m31s)

[default maybe](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m34s)

[not right so like this virtualization](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m36s)

[been](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h21m59s)

[correct once again cleaned up the links](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m00s)

[and drop the language](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m02s)

[bits like there's there's a certain](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m04s)

[amount of Elegance to these like if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m06s)

[these were lowquality docks changes I'd](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m09s)

[be a little more hesitant but they've](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m10s)

[against](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m47s)

[slower uh let's see fix code style](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m49s)

[issues](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m53s)

[this I think was just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m55s)

[a oh this is just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h22m58s)

[now flicted okay we may we may have to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m01s)

[go through and we may just go through](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m05s)

[and do a rebase but let's let's check](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m07s)

[some of these here uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m08s)

[coding](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m30s)

[um let's see some info](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m35s)

[uh okay so this one I think is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m48s)

[worth playing around with to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m53s)

[see let's let's let's check this one out](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m56s)

[what what's what's going on here what's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h23m59s)

[going on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m01s)

[here so Focus Parent slider on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m04s)

[click so it's inter internal that's fine](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m08s)

[because got a kind of a funky name but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m11s)

[that's that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m13s)

[okay uh let's see so onclick](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m15s)

[change](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m20s)

[uh this guy here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m22s)

[just leveraging an attached property I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m25s)

[was actually chatting with a colleague](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m26s)

[earlier today about attached properties](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m28s)

[we were doing Maui not WPF but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m30s)

[explaining the idea of being able to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m34s)

[hook up onchanged events to to add kind](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m36s)

[of fun stuff to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m38s)

[them oh that is interesting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m45s)

[okay there's something subtle that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m50s)

[happening here with this ad](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m52s)

[Handler um and going through this route](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m55s)

[so part of the reason for ad](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h24m58s)

[Handler um versus just the plus equals](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m00s)

[is this Boolean down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m03s)

[here um normally what happens with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m05s)

[routed events in WPF is they bubble up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m08s)

[through the tree and once a control](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m10s)

[marks the event is handled uh the event](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m12s)

[still continues bubbling but people who](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m16s)

[have registered for the event which just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m18s)

[like you know repeat button preview](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m20s)

[Mouse left button down Plus right they](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m22s)

[will only receive unhandled events so it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m25s)

[from uh most registrations perspective](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m28s)

[once it's handled the event stops](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m31s)

[propagating it still propagates it just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m33s)

[has its handled flag set to true but if](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m35s)

[you uh register this way and set this to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m37s)

[true you get all the events even the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m40s)

[ones marked as](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m42s)

[handled it's sort of a way of saying](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m43s)

[Noah no n I don't care if somebody](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m45s)

[inside handles it I I want to see it too](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m47s)

[so it's worth noting be help our](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m51s)

[the null propagation gives me a bit of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m56s)

[pause](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h25m59s)

[from a little surprised I might look at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m10s)

[Mouse button event](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m13s)

[handler I'm surprised that this is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m15s)

[object but this could be an artifact of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m19s)

[one of the older delegat](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m22s)

[uh let's see slider Setter like this is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m25s)

[fine except for this like this is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m30s)

[internal so it's not like anyone can](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m31s)

[override](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m33s)

[this you fine parent I'm surprised did](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m35s)

[we did we not already have a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m38s)

[fine surprised that we didn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m50s)

[have find parent](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h26m53s)

[in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m08s)

[oh surprised at that I would have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m11s)

[thought that we had it uh there's one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m13s)

[minor thing that I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m15s)

[noticing calling get parent and there's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m17s)

[no question mark here they denote](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m19s)

[nullability but then it's immediately](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m21s)

[checked for null](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m22s)

[um this is not technically a bug so the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m24s)

[important thing with Noble reference](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m28s)

[types in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m29s)

[C is there are multiple inputs to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m30s)

[whether a variable is considered](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m33s)

[nullable or not one of the inputs is how](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m35s)

[you've declared it with a question mark](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m38s)

[or without another one is if you check](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m39s)

[it for null the compiler then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m42s)

[immediately assumes that the value is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m44s)

[nullable and so it knows oh you checked](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m46s)

[it for null so from this point forward](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m49s)

[I'm going to assume that this thing is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m51s)

[nullable well there's a return so from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m52s)

[this point forward might literally be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m55s)

[the next line so it's not that far but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m56s)

[then we get down here it goes well I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h27m59s)

[know you were nullable but I also know](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m00s)

[that you aren't n because we we reached](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m03s)

[beyond the if kind of a weird thing but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m05s)

[in general the question](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m08s)

[mark interesting okay so let's let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m11s)

[play with this real quick so fix](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m14s)

[3628 over here F](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m18s)

[01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:29,840](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m21s)

uh see uh add remote and check out that

[is the button that we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m26s)

[want okay come here we come here and we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m43s)

[launch other thing that I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m48s)

[looking to do is add in velop pack stuff](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m50s)

[into my templates it'll probably be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m53s)

[behind an optional flag so you can do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m55s)

[like you know dash dash installers on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h28m58s)

[the net new able to pick it up but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m00s)

[there's enough there that I think it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m03s)

[probably worth](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m04s)

[doing okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m07s)

[whoa oh that is not the flavor of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m09s)

[Mountain Dew that I thought I grabbed](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m11s)

[Halloween flavored ones I had actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m17s)

[grabbed a purple Thunder and that was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m18s)

[not the the flavor palette I was going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m20s)

[for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m23s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m24s)

[so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m27s)

[the interesting part](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m32s)

[here these are the ones that should be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m38s)

[showing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m40s)

[it okay let me go back to that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m42s)

[bug](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m47s)

[so okay so the bug in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m49s)

[question uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m52s)

[uh yeah so fan control is related to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m54s)

[this project the developer was kind](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m57s)

[enough to give credit where credit was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h29m59s)

[due which is great like that's that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m02s)

[the polite thing to do when you consume](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m04s)

[somebody's open source project is at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m06s)

[least site them as a a source because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m08s)

[open source projects like that's all](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m11s)

[they have is notoriety so give them](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m13s)

[credit it doesn't cost](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m16s)

[much uh but I mean like the license the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m18s)

[the license on here is MIT which pretty](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m22s)

[much says you can do with this as you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m24s)

[want uh all you can't do is blame us for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m25s)

[anything I think is literally all it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m30s)

[is uh when using the mouse scroll wheel](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m32s)

[to change a slider the value tool tip](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m36s)

[doesn't show unless clicking the slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m38s)

[first got it so I need to be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m41s)

[here the issue I have is I don't see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m47s)

[I don't see a way to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m54s)

[like maybe maybe I'm being](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h30m59s)

[dumb](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m02s)

[uh this thing doesn't respond to Mouse](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m05s)

[wheel](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m09s)

[don't am I missing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m14s)

[something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m18s)

[um lighter](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m20s)

[I'm I'm confused now immediately](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m24s)

[because now I'm wondering about](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m28s)

[this let's see reproduction steps in the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m32s)

[demo app click on the tracks repeat](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m34s)

[buttons above or below the slider thumb](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m37s)

[note that the value changes but the tool](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m39s)

[tip is not shown until you click on the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m40s)

[thumb](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m43s)

[itself ah okay so that okay so pass](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m47s)

[Kevin was smart](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m51s)

[so in the demo](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m54s)

[app click on the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h31m56s)

[tracks here here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m00s)

[here above or below the slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m04s)

[thumb that I got I just got to get it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m15s)

[right on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m18s)

[the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m20s)

[tick I can get a i get a a thing to zero](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m21s)

[in on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m25s)

[it they'll get it to move without](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m28s)

[popping](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m30s)

[it interesting part so this mostly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m35s)

[Works](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m42s)

[um so let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m48s)

[see just yeah so just setting is move uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m51s)

[however this would impact the ux since](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m57s)

[as the name](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h32m59s)

[implies got it okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m10s)

[so is move to point](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m16s)

[enabled I guess the question is is move](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m20s)

[to point enabled on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m22s)

[any I guess the answer's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m24s)

[no](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m33s)

[abl the only so this is probably better](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m44s)

[but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m49s)

[uh oh oh yeah izy uh sorry I just saw](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m52s)

[your message uh was driving can you show](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m56s)

[the event registration thing again I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h33m58s)

[think that may solve a bug that I have](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m00s)

[for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m02s)

[sure so let's see here that was um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m04s)

[inside of here and I guess I can show it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m09s)

[in Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m11s)

[slider yeah](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m17s)

[so the the dirty little trick that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m18s)

[being done here is this ad handle call](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m21s)

[for being able to uh register up an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m24s)

[event because repeat button also has](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m27s)

[right if I do repeat button is it uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m30s)

[left Mouse button down or preview left](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m34s)

[Mouse button down right because I could](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m37s)

[do this and go through and register up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m40s)

[an event handler but this event handler](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m41s)

[will only yeah stop it will only be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m44s)

[invoked if the handled flag is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m47s)

[false by going through the ad Handler](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m50s)

[method instead you get access to this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m53s)

[extra little Boolean that says include](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m56s)

[handled vents to right that lovely](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h34m59s)

[little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m03s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m09s)

[oh oh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m11s)

[lovely October Fest has confirmed that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m14s)

[I've submitted enough PRS for to qualify](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m16s)

[as off shocking since I didn't start](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m19s)

[till the 30th uh but yeah so that's all](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m22s)

[it is is ADD Handler remove Handler to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m25s)

[be able to access it yeah no problem and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m27s)

[I wanted to look at this oh it is it is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m29s)

[object](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m31s)

[sender okay okay I stand](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m33s)

[corrected uh we're not going to leave](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m37s)

[that floating around oh I was going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m39s)

[fix](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m42s)

[the find parent this guy here should](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m43s)

[have a question mark yeah shut up um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m46s)

[the other thing that I was going to try](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m55s)

[because I just wanted to confirm the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m57s)

[change that it actually fixes what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h35m59s)

[it poses right is down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m02s)

[on uh let's see on the slider line](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m06s)

[20 okay so I just want to look here here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m10s)

[line 20 if we comment this out](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m13s)

[I kind of wonder if the solution is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m31s)

[rather than listening to it on the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m35s)

[repeat](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m36s)

[button listening to something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m37s)

[higher kind of gives me a a thought all](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m42s)

[right so this guy here so this is much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m45s)

[easier to reproduce because there are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m48s)

[there are repeat buttons left and right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m50s)

[of this guy so if we grab everybody's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m53s)

[favorite](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m55s)

[Snoop right drop that sucker in right so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h36m58s)

[if we look at the slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m00s)

[itself right so a a slider is made up of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m06s)

[of of things right but the the important](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m10s)

[things that the slider is made up of is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m13s)

[these repeat buttons plus the thumb](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m15s)

[right so the repeat button there's the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m18s)

[one to the left there's the one to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m20s)

[right there's the thumb in the middle](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m22s)

[right what we've sort of identified](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m25s)

[though is I can get clicks to fire on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m32s)

[the on the little tracks up here and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m33s)

[actually wonder](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m36s)

[if I go here instead of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m38s)

[background uh because I'm yeah bet](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m42s)

[you if I do background](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m44s)

[red yeah so the only reason it's harder](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m48s)

[to hit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m51s)

[is because without a background](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m54s)

[set um Mouse events don't register right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h37m56s)

[so background not set and background](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m01s)

[transparent are not quite the same](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m04s)

[thing I go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m07s)

[transparent right I can now click](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m11s)

[anywhere inside of this red outline](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m13s)

[rectangle that Snoop giving](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m16s)

[me and my mouse events will be handled](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m19s)

[so often times when you have something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m22s)

[like being able to click on that little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m24s)

[tick where by doing so the tick now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m25s)

[registers it's usually because that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m29s)

[thing has a color and therefore is hit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m31s)

[testable and everything else doesn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m33s)

[it's kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m36s)

[an this so the change makes it better](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m37s)

[say that I'm not sure it's the right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m41s)

[change I'm not sure that it's the right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m44s)

[change so because this guy here slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m47s)

[assist so it's it's just watching for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m51s)

[the mouse button and then propagating](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m53s)

[the click up to the slider and I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m56s)

[wondering if the solution is actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h38m58s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m00s)

[slider do it so what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m02s)

[is right because all it's doing is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m07s)

[moving Focus to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m09s)

[slider because without](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m13s)

[it Focus doesn't move to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m16s)

[slider therefore doesn't adjust so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m19s)

[past Kevin looked at this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m26s)

[and uh let's see so it's the discreet](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m30s)

[one focused Halo I think this is the guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m40s)

[this animation I believe was what's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m46s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m48s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m49s)

[be able to show off off all of these](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m54s)

[things because there's an](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m56s)

[ellipse oh the Halo is probably the one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h39m58s)

[around](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m00s)

[it uh where is the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m02s)

[value I'm wondering if there's something](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m10s)

[somewhat simpler](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m13s)

[here ladder tool tip converter it's this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m19s)

[text](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m23s)

[block](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m25s)

[um brush background vertical](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m31s)

[alignment I believe this is the guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m39s)

[who's actually displaying the value](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m41s)

[let's just confirm that so if I go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m44s)

[here a snoop](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m46s)

[window so my text block is in inside of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m50s)

[label which is inside of canvas it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m54s)

[alongside](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m57s)

[Halo](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h40m59s)

[so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m02s)

[canvas there you are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m04s)

[there and so from the canvas I'm looking](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m08s)

[for something with an X name of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m11s)

[lowercase](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m12s)

[label uh where is oh grid is named label](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m16s)

[that's not confusing at all](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m22s)

[all we named a grid label and then the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m24s)

[text block is the one inside of it so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m27s)

[yeah so this is the guy here that's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m29s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m31s)

[it so this is what is getting the fun](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m33s)

[rendering bits of it so somebody here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m38s)

[because he's the guy with the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m42s)

[name these are the story boards that are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m45s)

[triggering and what are the triggers](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m49s)

[that fire so there's your storyboard](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m52s)

[show hide Focus visual](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m56s)

[storyboard got to be a trigger or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h41m58s)

[something down here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m00s)

[that fires](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m02s)

[it uh because I'm looking for like a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m05s)

[begins storyboard or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m07s)

[similar not sure if that's a tooling](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m14s)

[thing or a problem](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m16s)

[thing uh let's see here only show focus](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m18s)

[when dragging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m21s)

[I think that's a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m26s)

[bug right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m28s)

[there uh that is the wrong relative](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m37s)

[Source](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m41s)

[oh stop it stop it stop](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m43s)

[it yeah so there's the enter and exit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m50s)

[action so data trigger true so when this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m54s)

[guy goes true so is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h42m57s)

[dragging he will show](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m00s)

[it think we can conclude we aren't in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m03s)

[the is dragging case this is the other](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m05s)

[one so it is when is](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m08s)

[focused and so focus is not being moved](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m14s)

[to the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m18s)

[slider is what is killing it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m20s)

[I think we can fix](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m26s)

[it think we can fix this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m32s)

[let's let's let's take a look because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m35s)

[think I think there's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m38s)

[probably okay come down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m43s)

[here right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m47s)

[so I am going to be watching very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m49s)

[closely on this focused element right](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m51s)

[down here on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m54s)

[stoop I can remember how to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m56s)

[use right that guy there focused element](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h43m59s)

[null Now We're Here drawer host so when](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m02s)

[click](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m06s)

[here focused element](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m08s)

[isn't right that guy is jumping around](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m10s)

[and is not gaining Focus so I am going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m14s)

[to be interested](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m17s)

[in focusable element specifically if we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m19s)

[look at like the repeat](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m23s)

[button if I make the repeat button](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m25s)

[focusable that make](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m28s)

[it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m38s)

[no](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m41s)

[why why does that not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m44s)

[work let's go here on our events let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h44m46s)

[here okay so the slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h45m36s)

[handles the preview Mouse](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h45m39s)

[down but it doesn't appear that we move](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h45m44s)

[slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h45m59s)

[so on the way down so the preview events](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m01s)

[are what are called tunneling and then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m05s)

[the the regular events are what are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m08s)

[called bubbling so when you click the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m09s)

[the preview event starts kind of at the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m12s)

[top level of your tree here and works](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m14s)

[its way down tunneling its way down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m15s)

[until it finds the element under your](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m18s)

[cursor and then that event bubbles back](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m20s)

[up right so the preview is on the way](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m24s)

[down till it finds the thing and then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m25s)

[Mouse down would propagate its way back](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m27s)

[up so we see uh preview Mouse down Mouse](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m30s)

[up but preview Mouse down went down and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m34s)

[then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m39s)

[because slider marked it as handled and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m44s)

[then it continued going down through the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m46s)

[slider elements right so the the event](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m48s)

[keeps going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m51s)

[right and it gets all the way down to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m53s)

[the repeat button which is why this guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m54s)

[here was registering up for that event](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h46m58s)

[and then moving Focus to it when it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m01s)

[occurred uh what is WPF uh so WPF is a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m05s)

[uh Windows specific desktop app](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m10s)

[Microsoft came out with in 2005 and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m16s)

[still exists today uh it lacks a little](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m20s)

[bit in popularity due to its age but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m23s)

[it's also really stable because of it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m25s)

[like people still build apps in it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m28s)

[um it's one that I very much love I I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m32s)

[do a lot of work in it if people are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m39s)

[looking for a more modern alternative um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m42s)

[my current my current pick is avalonia](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m45s)

[so avalonia uh UI so it's not a waffle](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m48s)

[Pancake House no oh no it is not but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h47m51s)

[author](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m19s)

[actually it left a nice uh it was on the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m20s)

[issue um here so for people who aren't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m26s)

[aware of this um this is like the worst](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m30s)

[the worst possible URL to try to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m34s)

[communicate verbally but Source period.](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m35s)

[period net you can actually uh browse](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m39s)

[the source code in net in a nice easy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m42s)

[way what would mix of waffle and pancake](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m46s)

[be like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m49s)

[glorious um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m51s)

[a good question so I will clarify the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m54s)

[waffle maker I have is old school it the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m56s)

[waffle maker might be older than me](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h48m59s)

[because I remember my parents using it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m01s)

[when I was a child so I don't know](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m02s)

[exactly how old it is but it's got](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m05s)

[Decades of life on it I know that much](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m07s)

[for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m09s)

[certain but it does not make some people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m10s)

[make waffles that are the real thick](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m12s)

[ones with the Deep holes mine are are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m14s)

[the real thin holes they're only like a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m17s)

[quarter inch thick maybe a little more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m19s)

[on each side and the total waffles like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m21s)

[I don't know somewhere between a half](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m24s)

[and 3/4 of an inch thick so my waffles](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m27s)

[are only know a thick to begin with so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m30s)

[they aren't much thicker than some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m33s)

[people's pancakes depending on where](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m34s)

[you're from they're thinner than some](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m36s)

[people's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m38s)

[pancakes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m41s)

[but it's interesting that this thing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m46s)

[Marx has handled](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m48s)

[it is moved to Point enabled](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m50s)

[track it updates the value it just and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m55s)

[it marks it as handle but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h49m58s)

[never see I'm kind of wondering if a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m03s)

[better fix](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m05s)

[here if a better fix here and this is so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m09s)

[if we go with this this same](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m13s)

[idea right um and rather than applying](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m16s)

[this on a repeat button](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m19s)

[lighter](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m25s)

[right I I I think the fix might be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m28s)

[something more akin to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m43s)

[think uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m46s)

[see I think we do something like that on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m50s)

[honestly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h50m54s)

[uh and then we come back over to here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m03s)

[and rather than setting this here we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m06s)

[come over here and go to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m09s)

[the uh discret](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m12s)

[thumb slider horizontal slider](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m15s)

[vertical discret slider horizontal](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m19s)

[uh I want the style that uses](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m24s)

[these cre horizontal slider right so I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m29s)

[do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m33s)

[this I go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m34s)

[here and then I go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m37s)

[here and then we recile and launch](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m41s)

[that's kind of what I'm thinking dang it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m44s)

[now I am hungry for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m46s)

[waffles once the stream ends I'm going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m49s)

[to go make some waffles](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m51s)

[this is not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m55s)

[good I wasn't hungry until now and now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m56s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h51m59s)

[click that works now the one thing I'm](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m08s)

[really interested in is let's see if we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m11s)

[can because the other failure case was](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m14s)

[with a transparent](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m17s)

[background right so if we go up here and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m20s)

[we set](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m22s)

[background and we set](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m24s)

[transparent just to make it easier to to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m27s)

[click anywhere I click](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m30s)

[here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m33s)

[moves](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m36s)

[I I kind of like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m41s)

[better I I think I like that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m47s)

[better is then doesn't matter if you hit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m51s)

[the repeat button or if you hit anywhere](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m53s)

[on the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m55s)

[track because it'll catch you both on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h52m58s)

[the way](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m00s)

[in I'm now](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m03s)

[wondering now wondering if it should be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m07s)

[exposed or if it should be internal what](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m10s)

[if you took a piece of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m12s)

[waffle batter and cooked it in a waffle](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m19s)

[maker uh that would probably be very](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m20s)

[good one of so I saw this thing I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m23s)

[it was on Tik Tok or one of the one of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m26s)

[the platforms I I was scrolling through](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m29s)

[a timeline feed somebody took a cheese](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m31s)

[stick and uh put it on a skewer and dip](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m34s)

[the cheese stick in waffle batter and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m38s)

[then cook that on a waffle maker and you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m41s)

[get a cheese field Waffle and I saw that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m43s)

[way and I'm like the best way I was like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m48s)

[I have cheese sticks I I have waffle](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m51s)

[maker let's do this I tried it it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m53s)

[totally works and it's really really](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m56s)

[good you got to get your waffle batter](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h53m59s)

[thick because if it's too runny it just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m01s)

[kind of goes crazy so you want extra](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m03s)

[thick waffle batter](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m05s)

[um but then it totally works and you get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m08s)

[these nice cheesy filled waffles that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m11s)

[actually go really well you can dip them](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m14s)

[in um well I'll dip them in like uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m16s)

[something a little more savory like at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m20s)

[the time we had some salmon cream](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m22s)

[cheese](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m26s)

[wonderful wonderful stuff it like not](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m28s)

[quite like I imagine like marinara sauce](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m33s)

[like like a mozzarella stick it would go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m36s)

[in it well well I think I didn't we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m38s)

[don't have mozzarella sticks very often](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m42s)

[so I didn't have anything to work with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m44s)

[but I suspect it would be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m45s)

[amazing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m48s)

[okay I think I like this slightly better](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m50s)

[and then it it it resolves the original](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m54s)

[posters issue I'm now just questioning](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m56s)

[whether this should be public or](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h54m59s)

[not oh sorry not that one this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m10s)

[one cuz I'm wondering if it should](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m18s)

[actually be Focus slider on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m20s)

[click and if we name it slightly](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m24s)

[better I think this makes it I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m28s)

[this makes it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m30s)

[better let's let's do this I I think](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m33s)

[this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m36s)

[is I think this is better and and I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m38s)

[think exposing it is probably](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m41s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m45s)

[um going to dial this sucker down to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m47s)

[oh should we do range base instead of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m52s)

[slider probably okay just looking at](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m55s)

[what the other ones are but now if we go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h55m58s)

[public we we can public this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m00s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m03s)

[Public](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m06s)

[public on and then we're going to rename](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m08s)

[this sucker to not have the word parent](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m10s)

[in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m12s)

[it on the so my big head doesn't get in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m15s)

[the way um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m18s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m27s)

[here and indent that a little bit just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m28s)

[so it lines up](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m31s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m33s)

[you I think rather than regening](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m38s)

[it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m41s)

[um we're just going to do a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m46s)

[comment I get I I'm one of the people](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m50s)

[who like I have a LoveHate relationship](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m53s)

[with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m56s)

[reg they're okay but](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h56m57s)

[GH](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m01s)

[um bothers me that these two have to get](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m14s)

[set in reverse order from](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m17s)

[reorder it bothers me I get bothered](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m19s)

[about little things](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m23s)

[okay goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m25s)

[that goes like that that is perfect I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m27s)

[think this is this is a better](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m29s)

[solution so I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m32s)

[do is we're going to add](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m34s)

[in uh let's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m35s)

[see moving this to be on the fider self](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m38s)

[um I want to double check the zaml](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m46s)

[uh let's see here and we should format](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m52s)

[zaml make it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m55s)

[pretty](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m57s)

[thatat and then I want to remove this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h57m59s)

[line](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m01s)

[here check my diff real](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m03s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m08s)

[you like](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m11s)

[that we should double check that this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m15s)

[works only show visual while dragging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m19s)

[double check that to make sure I haven't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m22s)

[broken anything that's the change we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m23s)

[expect we no longer need this tree](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m26s)

[helper method do we kill it probably](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m28s)

[because I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m31s)

[don't the problem is is every API I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m33s)

[leave in that's public I have to support](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m36s)

[and the less things I have to support](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m40s)

[the better so until we have a need for](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m42s)

[it we'll kill](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m46s)

[it and then](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m48s)

[here we do](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m54s)

[that oh we wanted toest the is dragging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h58m58s)

[bit I think our demo app has has one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m02s)

[with that flag already](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m05s)

[set](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m06s)

[oops ah Focus slider on click the nice](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m11s)

[part by by exposing this is this will](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m16s)

[allow if if somebody wants to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m19s)

[get the old Behavior back they can turn](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m23s)

[it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m25s)

[off maybe it's default the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m26s)

[false I don't think so I like it feels](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m30s)

[weird that Focus doesn't move when you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m34s)

[click on a on a slider the fact that the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m35s)

[slider does that it feels](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m37s)

[wrong but I I think it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m42s)

[actually let's see](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m46s)

[uh what I'm looking for is that property](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m49s)

[for only showing while](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m53s)

[dragging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m55s)

[disabled not do we not set it anywhere](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=01h59m59s)

[fine test it we will test it with](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m02s)

[Snoop go](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m08s)

[here search](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m11s)

[dragging there turn it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m13s)

[on only show Focus visual while dragging](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m18s)

[uh that is doing the opposite of what we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m29s)

[wanted that is showing it](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m32s)

[always clearly that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m35s)

[Chang come down](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m38s)

[here uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m45s)

[unstage that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m47s)

[uh let's discard those](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m53s)

[changes test this one more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h00m58s)

[time I discard the wrong change](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m15s)

[oh oh I didn't did I not save](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m35s)

[it so line 1019 going have the same](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m40s)

[book undone something that I didn't](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m46s)

[intend to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m48s)

[undo okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m49s)

[keep it focused on just the story in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m53s)

[question but it does feel like we should](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h01m57s)

[have one that shows off the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m01s)

[other option as well don't have to every](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m04s)

[time actually one of the things about](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m09s)

[the demo app I've contemplated](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m11s)

[changing is rather than trying to show](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m14s)

[everything and every possible](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m16s)

[combination it seems like it might be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m18s)

[useful to have a page where you pick a](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m20s)

[control we show you a set of like the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m22s)

[common](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m24s)

[properties and you can then just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m25s)

[tweaks y that is desired](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m33s)

[Behavior okay so we're gonna we're going](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m38s)

[to ship as we've got so be on the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m40s)

[slider uh](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m46s)

[side uh this also fixes](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h02m53s)

[stuff going on maybe it's Overkill um](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m00s)

[but for things like this where it starts](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m04s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m07s)

[complicated I like I have trouble](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m08s)

[stuff like uh you'll see on their site](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m35s)

[that um get Kraken is somewhat focusing](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m39s)

[around kind of holistic Dev tools rather](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m42s)

[than just uh git related tools because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h06m45s)

[release oh and I got to approve it given](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h07m58s)

[that I just pushed the branch I think we](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m01s)

[can conclude that it should be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m03s)

[pushed cool that got a lot more](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m09s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m14s)

[in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m16s)

[okay uh close tabs uh when I click close](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m18s)

[button will'll actually close tab](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m22s)

[one uh why is this issue](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m29s)

[closed I don't know if anyone can hear](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m40s)

[that but apparently my Amazon device](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m42s)

[that is nearby I must have said](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m45s)

[something that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m47s)

[triggered um and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m50s)

[that man](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m55s)

[parameter ah interesting oh because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h08m58s)

[selected tab isn't the the tab in](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m01s)

[question got it uh this is good the one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m04s)

[thing about this that uh so binding](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m08s)

[period is the equivalent of binding path](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m14s)

[equals period which is also the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m16s)

[equivalent equivalent of omitting the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m18s)

[path entirely](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m20s)

[so we can actually](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m21s)

[um we'll just check this one out because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m24s)

[I assume this will be a this will be](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m26s)

[quick well we might we might end on this](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m29s)

[end on a high note right so this guy](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m31s)

[here](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m34s)

[is that file again tabs. sample thank](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m35s)

[you I actually wonder](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m40s)

[if we might have this problem on](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m43s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m45s)

[ABS did did this one have a tabs](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m48s)

[no one have it probably does I imagine](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m54s)

[no come on Visual Studio stop](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h09m59s)

[hanging nope it doesn't Okay cool so](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m03s)

[it's just it's going to be just this one](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m06s)

[so down here this guy our line](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m08s)

[number on where are](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m13s)

[you 7:35 but I didn't just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m18s)

[seven okay the design not like you](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m25s)

[735 boom so we can actually do this and](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m30s)

[then we should be able to verify that](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m33s)

[that also](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m35s)

[still at some point I may go through](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m36s)

[like the the original guidance when I](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m40s)

[took over the library was don't show](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m42s)

[preference to to one mvvm Library over](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m45s)

[another um the problem is is the the the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m48s)

[Battle of mvvm libraries has kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m52s)

[been fought and one already so I kind of](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m54s)

[am willing to disregard that because](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h10m58s)

[that was back when there was at least](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m01s)

[like three or four reasonable](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m03s)

[choices](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m05s)

[um product ux designer okay](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m07s)

[cool yeah my understanding is it's](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m15s)

[actually a reasonable place to work to](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m17s)

[so let's see so if I so tab one is the](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m21s)

[selected so if I hit X closes tab three](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m24s)

[huzzah we'll just](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m29s)

[push clean up binding](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m33s)

[path](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m40s)

[commit](https://youtu.be/lrgd06-4HMk?t=02h11m42s)
