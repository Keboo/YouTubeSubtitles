[that I am looking forward to there's a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h00m55s)

[whole lot of stuff in here around AI not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h00m57s)

[really shocking given all of the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m00s)

[cool stuff that's been coming out of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m02s)

[Microsoft and GitHub recently so you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m04s)

[see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m07s)

[I mean just scrolling in the first six](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m08s)

[we've got ai ai ai so you know it's it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m10s)

[it's kind of a big deal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m14s)

[um all the chat GPT things so also if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m17s)

[that's an interesting topic to people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m20s)

[I've been playing around with it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m21s)

[building stuff on it seems kind of cool](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m23s)

[it's kind of fun](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m26s)

[um but if that's something that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m28s)

[interests people and you'd like to see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m29s)

[sort of some examples of uh plugging](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m31s)

[that thing into your own app let me know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m33s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m37s)

[yeah that some total plan as as you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m40s)

[tell it's been a long couple weeks I did](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m43s)

[not prep a brain teaser I'm behind on my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m46s)

[videos I'm just like you know what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m48s)

[I'm not gonna stress we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m51s)

[catch up as things happen](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m53s)

[holy cow my office has gotten hot today](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m55s)

[and I don't know why](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h01m59s)

[the where I live we have a joke that we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m00s)

[usually get winter second winter and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m03s)

[then spring is about four days long and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m05s)

[then you get Summer and it's great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m08s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m11s)

[so it was going to start with a pull](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m12s)

[request review here and maybe play](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m13s)

[around with a couple other uh PR's as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m15s)

[well and actually I think I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m18s)

[here and bring this tab back and do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m19s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m21s)

[came in on the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m23s)

[um Discord Channel](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m28s)

[uh I don't know a while back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m29s)

[and the the gentleman had who had](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m31s)

[proposed I was like sure sounds great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m34s)

[like if you want to put together a draft](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m36s)

[PR we can see about merging it I'm not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m39s)

[necessarily planning on bringing all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m41s)

[controls like every control somebody can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m43s)

[dream up into the library but this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m46s)

[one that has been requested a number of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m48s)

[times the material design extensions](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m50s)

[library has a version of it it's great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m53s)

[um but it's it's clearly popular enough](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h02m57s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m00s)

[that people want it so I figured let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m02s)

[go ahead and do it uh one second here I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m04s)

[just want to verify that my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m07s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m11s)

[all the links not just to get crack and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m13s)

[Link](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m16s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m17s)

[so but draft PR is open so I figured](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m19s)

[we'll dive in take a look it it looks](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m22s)

[pretty good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m25s)

[as it is here like there there's a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m27s)

[of stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m31s)

[um so you can see the the changes made](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m32s)

[here created a new numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m34s)

[control that allows the user to either](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m36s)

[uh type in numeric values within a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m38s)

[specific range great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m41s)

[um implemented first style for it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m43s)

[perfect I mean the style is very](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m46s)

[simplistic there's probably some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m48s)

[optional improvements here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m50s)

[um integrated the numeric up down uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m52s)

[with the material design main demo and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m55s)

[added a page to display Styles perfect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m56s)

[like as far as like a minimum viable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h03m58s)

[product goes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m01s)

[can't ask for a lot more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m06s)

[okay so potentially more documentation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m07s)

[very true uh support for common input](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m10s)

[methods such as keyboard and mouse input](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m13s)

[yeah this is one that I would probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m15s)

[consider at minimum so Mouse I think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m17s)

[just having the two um buttons for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m19s)

[interaction is probably fine but having](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m22s)

[a keyboard up down arrows is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m26s)

[functioning to move things up and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m29s)

[is probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m31s)

[uh worthwhile](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m32s)

[uh logarithmic click scroll I guess](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m35s)

[Mouse scroll could be an interesting one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m37s)

[it's a little awkward most users don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m40s)

[expect form fields to change on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m43s)

[scroll wheel and the other thing is if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m47s)

[you catch the mouse scroll if this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m50s)

[put inside of a scroll viewer it's it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m51s)

[can be one of those obnoxious things so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m54s)

[less sold on Mouse light keyboard uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h04m56s)

[let's see logarithmic scroll to go up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m00s)

[and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m02s)

[I could see it it depends on uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m04s)

[I guess it depends on what you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m08s)

[putting in here uh let's see tune the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m10s)

[bass style to adhere more closely to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m12s)

[material design principles yeah I do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m14s)

[think cleaning some of this up a little](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m16s)

[bit and we'll dive in and take a look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m18s)

[it and see if these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m20s)

[um I think there's actually icons for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m22s)

[the plus and minus and I just visually I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m24s)

[think those are characters but again not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m26s)

[a big deal create additional styling](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m29s)

[templates to provide more options yeah I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m31s)

[know there's a couple different ways](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m34s)

[that people do this one of the things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m35s)

[that immediately jumps out to me as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m37s)

[is typically](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m41s)

[going lower is on the left and going up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m42s)

[is on the right so these buttons almost](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m44s)

[feel a little backwards to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m46s)

[and add the new Styles and back and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m48s)

[forth the only other thing that I could](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m51s)

[potentially see adding for the potential](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m53s)

[changes is adding a couple](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m58s)

[uh UI tests around it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h05m59s)

[but as you can see this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m01s)

[there's a bunch of stuff here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m06s)

[and there's the myops one okay cool cool](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m09s)

[cool cool cool cool so there's all of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m13s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m15s)

[um I'm trying to decide do we look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m16s)

[the code here or do we just let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m18s)

[briefly we'll ignore the demo for the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m20s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m23s)

[let's just briefly look at this and then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m24s)

[we'll Circle back to the other one okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m26s)

[so the control itself](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m27s)

[that's tiny font font bigger uh this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m29s)

[gonna be hard to see let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m33s)

[get cracking uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m34s)

[add and check out please](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m38s)

[thank you and let's go material design](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m42s)

[and we go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h06m48s)

[we will take a look so I don't care](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m00s)

[about what tabs you have open close all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m04s)

[tabs](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m06s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m07s)

[numeric](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m10s)

[up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m13s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m16s)

[so uh for anybody looking to build a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m19s)

[brand new custom control this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m21s)

[actually set up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m23s)

[pretty close to exactly what you want to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m25s)

[do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m27s)

[so first thing when building a custom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m28s)

[control is first decide if that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m31s)

[actually what you want versus a user](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m34s)

[control there's there's pros and cons to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m35s)

[each the user control tends to be a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m38s)

[little bit easier custom controls](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m40s)

[require more work but in this case](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m41s)

[within this kind of Library setup a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m43s)

[custom control is the right choice the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m45s)

[next decision point is what your base](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m48s)

[class is going to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m50s)

[um oftentimes something like control or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m52s)

[content control can be quite common](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m55s)

[um as reasonable basis uh content](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h07m58s)

[control if you want to control that kind](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m03s)

[of maybe wraps some other user provided](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m04s)

[content perhaps](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m06s)

[in this case regular control is very](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m08s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m11s)

[um and then anything that you are going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m13s)

[to require as part of your template so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m15s)

[there's a separation in WPF between the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m17s)

[code behind for the control which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m20s)

[what this is and then the UI portion of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m21s)

[it but at some point there has to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m24s)

[that linkage back of you know how do I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m26s)

[interact with it so what this control is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m28s)

[doing is declaring that okay you can do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m31s)

[a new template and change the UI however](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m33s)

[you want but at the end of the day I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m35s)

[expect a couple repeat buttons in a text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m38s)

[box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m40s)

[okay great and just by convention uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m40s)

[template parts are prefixed with all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m44s)

[caps part underscore so increase button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m46s)

[decrease button text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m49s)

[this has the word field on it and I'm a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m53s)

[little](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m55s)

[I'm not sure how I feel about the word](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m58s)

[field I'm sure that's probably on some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h08m59s)

[other ones but the word field makes me a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m01s)

[little Twitchy we'll see we'll come back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m04s)

[to that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m06s)

[for the moment okay uh the other thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m07s)

[to do is to set the default style key so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m10s)

[I've talked before about how Styles work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m14s)

[in WPF how there's a Target type and a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m16s)

[style will have a key as well if you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m19s)

[not specify a key the key is derived](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m21s)

[from the target type what this is doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m24s)

[here is it's saying okay the default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m26s)

[style key for this control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m28s)

[is a style who has a Target type of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m31s)

[numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m34s)

[perfect right that's sort of the default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m35s)

[that you would want](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m38s)

[um so that is quite common to do in your](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m40s)

[static Constructor and then we've got a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m43s)

[bunch of dependency properties so we've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m45s)

[got minimum maximum](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m47s)

[um let's see int Min value and max value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m51s)

[great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m54s)

[like some people might argue and say](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m56s)

[well what if that's not big enough yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h09m57s)

[the user's clicking to move these how](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m00s)

[many times are they really going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m02s)

[click](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m03s)

[uh let's see the current value great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m04s)

[really all I'm doing is double checking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m09s)

[things like the declared type the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m11s)

[default value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m14s)

[and just to make sure that the property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m16s)

[metadata is set appropriately this thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m18s)

[does have an on value changed we'll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m20s)

[Circle back to that in a moment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m22s)

[take a look let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m24s)

[a couple commands that can be specified](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m26s)

[and that looks fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m32s)

[increase decrease command great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m35s)

[okay the only other thing that could be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m43s)

[potentially useful this is very well set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m46s)

[up for somebody using this control in an](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m49s)

[mvvm layout](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m52s)

[uh I don't know this looks like somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m56s)

[may have copied and pasted too much I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m58s)

[would have expected something more like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h10m59s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m03s)

[minor deal is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m04s)

[uh oh maybe they're down here I was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m06s)

[gonna say routed events never mind here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m08s)

[they are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m10s)

[and this is actually very good design so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m11s)

[a lot of times when people do uh routed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m14s)

[events on a control they'll forget to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m17s)

[things like apply categories so that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m20s)

[they're set appropriately this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m22s)

[I think just about perfect setup](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m25s)

[so the thing with routed events versus a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m29s)

[regular c-sharp event routed events](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m34s)

[can uh route through the the UI](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m35s)

[hierarchy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m39s)

[which is very convenient it's also what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m41s)

[if somebody wants to use this uh control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m45s)

[and access it in the code behind this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m47s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m50s)

[the most likely case that they're going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m51s)

[to want to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m53s)

[the other thing I could see potentially](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m55s)

[adding here is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h11m57s)

[like we've got commands on here but just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m01s)

[like how the button control has both a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m04s)

[command and a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m07s)

[um a click Handler I could see Arguments](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m10s)

[for uh an event for you know the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m12s)

[increase in decrease](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m17s)

[um things to be clicked I could also see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m19s)

[an argument for putting in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m24s)

[uh min max our textbook example for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m26s)

[coercion callbacks yeah the other thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m29s)

[is I I could also see these commands](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m32s)

[needing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m35s)

[command parameters so that's another](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m36s)

[thing and again I'm I'm basing this on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m38s)

[like I like to look for prior art on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m41s)

[other controls to to mimic and button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m45s)

[has a lot of symmetry here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m48s)

[of being able to set this kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m50s)

[up now admittedly this particular](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m53s)

[template has a text box and two buttons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m55s)

[in it but I I would kind of expect that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h12m57s)

[those types of things flow back and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m01s)

[forth but as a first run not bad at all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m02s)

[uh okay value changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m05s)

[comes in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m09s)

[cast the control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m10s)

[there's only a minor thing here that I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m13s)

[that I might comment on so this is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m15s)

[noble uh numeric up down at this point](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m19s)

[and it instantiates and it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m22s)

[appropriately null checked the thing is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m24s)

[is you've gone to all of the effort to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m26s)

[instantiate this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m27s)

[even if it's not a numeric up down now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m29s)

[this is a private static function inside](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m33s)

[of the control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m36s)

[I'm not like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m39s)

[I can't write code very easily to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m42s)

[trigger this and have this not and and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m44s)

[hit the null case here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m47s)

[so it's less of a concern but oftentimes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m49s)

[I would do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m52s)

[um pattern matching or similar to avoid](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m54s)

[this instantiation if uh if this control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h13m56s)

[is null but right now there's I can't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m00s)

[think of how I would write a test to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m03s)

[trigger the null case so it's like man](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m05s)

[that's a minor thing not a big deal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m07s)

[also welcome Nikolai](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m12s)

[um validate input okay and this one here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m14s)

[so I see property name](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m17s)

[is being passed in here but it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m20s)

[completely unused](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m22s)

[and I have a I have a suspicion](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m26s)

[yeah so this guy was passing it in I I I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m32s)

[suspect the intent here was to have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m40s)

[a raised property changed event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m47s)

[yeah and this guy here is a little this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m49s)

[is sort of a little awkward like because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m52s)

[Nikolai put in the chat there the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m54s)

[um doing coercion for these types of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h14m57s)

[ones so rather than validating input](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m00s)

[here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m03s)

[because all this method does is it takes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m04s)

[in the the input object calls to string](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m06s)

[verifies it parses as an INT right and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m09s)

[then basically locks it into the min max](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m13s)

[Robert welcome yes WPF custom controls](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m21s)

[this this works but there's a a cleaner](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m23s)

[approach so on your property metadata](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m26s)

[there is uh an additional overload in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m30s)

[addition to the property change callback](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m33s)

[you have a coerced value callback and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m35s)

[I'm I believe this is what you were](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m38s)

[referring to Nikolai is rather than](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m40s)

[doing this validate input here because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m42s)

[it's very unusual when you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m44s)

[implementing one of these wrapper](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m45s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m47s)

[um to not just have them look like this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m49s)

[like that's real common](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m51s)

[um and instead the the validation would](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m54s)

[be over on this side that way the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h15m57s)

[dependency property chain works the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m00s)

[other drawback with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m03s)

[um doing it inside of these Getters and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m05s)

[Setters is not everything actually flows](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m08s)

[through this value property so even](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m11s)

[though it looks like everything flows](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m14s)

[through the value property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m16s)

[this is actually Exposed on the control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m18s)

[and there's nothing magical that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m22s)

[prevents somebody because set value for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m25s)

[example](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m27s)

[this is just a public method on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m28s)

[dependency object](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m30s)

[so for example](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m32s)

[right oh let's not do it inside of a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m35s)

[static method uh I need an instance](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m37s)

[method this will work so somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m39s)

[outside could very easily call you know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m42s)

[let's see uh new](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m48s)

[num gets new whatever right but I could](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m51s)

[I could bypass the value and call set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m55s)

[value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m58s)

[right and then do numeric up down value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h16m59s)

[property you know 45](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m03s)

[well outside my maximum and bypass that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m07s)

[validation logic that's being put in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m11s)

[there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m13s)

[uh let's see thanks only briefly here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m15s)

[we'll catch recording working on a fix](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m17s)

[on this little Branch hope to have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m19s)

[improvements very soon](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m21s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m25s)

[there's enough in there that I think it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m41s)

[should go I I tried to poke at my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m43s)

[theming stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h17m45s)

[doing software development uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m23s)

[I gotta do math now with years in it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m28s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m45s)

[pretty much that entire time I have been](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m46s)

[doing Microsoft tech stack like some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m49s)

[people bounce around and and get a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m52s)

[of exposure to different things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m57s)

[once I graduated from University I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h18m58s)

[really didn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m01s)

[like I so I'm in Washington state](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m03s)

[Microsoft is in Redmond in Washington](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m07s)

[they're like four and a half hours away](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m10s)

[from me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m11s)

[and so even though some people will say](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m12s)

[oh you know this language or this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m15s)

[it's like that may be true but I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m19s)

[really close to Microsoft and that has a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m21s)

[there's a a much larger Microsoft set of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m24s)

[developers the closer you get to Redmond](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m27s)

[and even though I'm four and a half](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m29s)

[hours away there's still a substantial](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m31s)

[amount of C](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m33s)

[see you Nicole have a good day](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m37s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m39s)

[okay so this validate input probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m41s)

[should be converted into a coerced](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m44s)

[property callback and we'll write this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m47s)

[up in the pr because I I think this this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m48s)

[is uh this control is largely being used](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m52s)

[as a learning opportunity](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m57s)

[uh also been doing microsoft.net based](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h19m59s)

[development as well ARP API MVC not much](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m02s)

[WPF though don't feel too bad WPF is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m06s)

[I don't want to say a dying breed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m11s)

[um it is one of the mature desktop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m13s)

[development Frameworks](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m17s)

[um theoretically things like dot net](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m20s)

[Maui and win ui3 are supposed to be The](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m23s)

[Replacements but Microsoft has tried to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m25s)

[introduce a replacement for WPF twice](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m28s)

[now and I will argue has failed twice](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m30s)

[now so I'm not holding my breath I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m33s)

[waiting I would very happily like to see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m36s)

[see some stuff going yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m39s)

[now I've been doing recently yeah Maui](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m42s)

[is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m44s)

[fairly nice like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m46s)

[I I still have yet to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m49s)

[I need to play with Maui in the context](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m52s)

[of doing a desktop app I've only done](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m54s)

[Maui in terms of Android and iOS](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m56s)

[so I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h20m59s)

[and a little bit there it's it's very](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m00s)

[good it is significantly better than](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m03s)

[xamarin forms it is awesome](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m06s)

[um the Blazer hybrid stuff looks utterly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m09s)

[amazing to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m11s)

[um so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m13s)

[for what those are worth okay so apply](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m15s)

[template so this is actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m18s)

[this is interesting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m21s)

[I rarely see somebody handle the case of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m24s)

[unregistering the events](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m27s)

[um so these ones here you don't actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m30s)

[need the null checks or the null](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m32s)

[forgiveness operators on these clicks so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m36s)

[it is good to make sure you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m39s)

[appropriately handling null but in these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m42s)

[cases you're accessing UI elements and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m44s)

[you're not allowed to touch a UI element](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m48s)

[outside of the UI thread](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m49s)

[so because all UI element interaction](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m52s)

[has to be single threaded you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m56s)

[guarantee that once you've checked this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m58s)

[field for null that no other thread can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h21m59s)

[change it to be null between point a and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m03s)

[point B](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m05s)

[so and just by virtue of the framework](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m06s)

[you can trust it so things like these no](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m09s)

[forgiveness operators aren't necessarily](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m11s)

[needed there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m13s)

[um but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m15s)

[pulls the template elements out](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m17s)

[checksum](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m19s)

[once again the null check isn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m21s)

[necessarily or the uh the no forgiveness](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m23s)

[operator isn't needed there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m26s)

[interesting that we also did lost Focus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m28s)

[and value gets applied in that that all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m33s)

[makes sense of applying it straight](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m36s)

[through](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m38s)

[I'm curious why](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m41s)

[something seems a little off here and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m46s)

[I'm trying to figure out what it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m48s)

[the one that can go away](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m53s)

[the initial setting of the text is fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m55s)

[and this likely needs to occur before](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h22m58s)

[this up down let's finish our way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m01s)

[through and double check okay so sender](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m02s)

[is null return](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m05s)

[so this is all fine but this is actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m11s)

[a really Overkill](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m20s)

[this method could be reduced to this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m23s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m27s)

[one could argue that it should really be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m31s)

[something like if uh text box field is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m33s)

[uh let's see Xbox](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m37s)

[and then something like this for anybody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m41s)

[who hasn't seen it the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m43s)

[um double curly braces this is just a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m45s)

[null check and an assignment into a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m48s)

[local variable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m50s)

[so it's it's doing several things it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m51s)

[checking this field for null](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m54s)

[um if this is non-null Assa create and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m57s)

[assign a new local variable that's in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h23m59s)

[scope with inside this if statement the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m01s)

[entire expression returns true which](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m04s)

[gets you inside and then you get to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m06s)

[it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m09s)

[see uh I'm from Sri Lanka was studying](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m10s)

[in New Zealand what should I do to get a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m13s)

[job in a foreign country uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m16s)

[oh boy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m20s)

[um that I don't have a ton of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m21s)

[information on so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m25s)

[um General job market stuff uh what I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m30s)

[would recommend is making sure that you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m33s)

[have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m35s)

[um a reasonable resume posted up on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m38s)

[something public](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m41s)

[um ideally with code samples so if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m43s)

[that's like a GitHub repo or similar](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m45s)

[um and actually hang on I've got a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m47s)

[there was a video myself and a few](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m50s)

[colleagues did not that long ago](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m53s)

[it was targeted at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m56s)

[sorry kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h24m59s)

[find it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m01s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m04s)

[yeah it was targeted specifically at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m06s)

[people who were looking for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m09s)

[internships](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m12s)

[um but a lot of it applies](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m13s)

[Beyond just software interns so it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m16s)

[this video here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m19s)

[um a lot of it applies Beyond just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m22s)

[internships and anyone who's looking to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m24s)

[um kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m28s)

[get into software development and do the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m30s)

[work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m33s)

[so I mean a couple key tips uh having](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m34s)

[have an updated resume have something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m37s)

[public with code that you can share it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m39s)

[much easier for people to want to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m42s)

[interview you if you've got code](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m45s)

[examples that you can share](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m46s)

[if you don't have anything that's not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m48s)

[necessarily](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m51s)

[going to exclude you but it you likely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m52s)

[get moved further down people's hiring](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m56s)

[lists in a lot of cases now I'm also](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h25m58s)

[speaking from somebody who's in America](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m00s)

[so I don't have a lot of knowledge](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m02s)

[outside of that so everywhere else take](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m05s)

[it with a grain of salt](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m07s)

[and I also don't have any knowledge on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m11s)

[like visas or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m17s)

[or that kind of thing that that is the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m18s)

[the company I work for we have people in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m21s)

[HR and whatnot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m23s)

[um starting a blog is definitely not a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m25s)

[bad idea the the thing to note is that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m27s)

[when people are looking at your resume](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m30s)

[um they are they may if they see a link](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m33s)

[to a Blog they may open it and read](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m36s)

[through an entry or two that look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m39s)

[um interesting but they most of the time](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m42s)

[when people are reading stuff they're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m45s)

[not likely to read Long blog posts or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m47s)

[similar so if you have something that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m49s)

[you can use to show expertise that will](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m51s)

[certainly help really anything you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m54s)

[do to show show off what you know that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h26m56s)

[great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m00s)

[um and if uh blogging is something that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m01s)

[that you know and can do well great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m05s)

[um just know that the at least when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m08s)

[we're interviewing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m11s)

[um the blog post can be helpful but it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m14s)

[not usually as helpful as looking to to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m16s)

[see what somebody can actually do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m19s)

[um blog posts are kind of a weird](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m22s)

[situation because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m25s)

[when people on my team ask me about](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m28s)

[writing blog posts I usually tell them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m30s)

[hey entry level content isn't a bad](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m32s)

[thing to write blogs about people are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m35s)

[like well but there's there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m36s)

[it's like yeah but if you can if if you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m38s)

[try to search for how to do something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m40s)

[and it's difficult for you to kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m42s)

[piece the things together](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m44s)

[write write a blog specifically on that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m46s)

[even if it's kind of entry level stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m49s)

[if it was hard for you to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m51s)

[um then it then it's usually an](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m54s)

[indication that there's a gap somewhere](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m56s)

[in either samples documentation or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h27m58s)

[whatnot and it's very worthwhile](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m01s)

[especially entry-level content gets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m02s)

[so many more hits than advanced level](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m06s)

[content because your audience is so much](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m07s)

[bigger uh blog but YouTube video Plus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m09s)

[Code sample yeah that would be awesome](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m12s)

[something like that is likely to to get](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m15s)

[you looked at very quickly so if you are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m18s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m20s)

[um again I don't know much about hiring](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m22s)

[people out of country or or remote work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m24s)

[across country boundaries because I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m27s)

[don't interact with that much but yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m30s)

[something like that would definitely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m32s)

[make you stand out above the crowd](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m34s)

[okay so numeric value changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m41s)

[text boss locks Focus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m44s)

[yeah not a problem zen music uh I am](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m47s)

[very I people who watch my channel a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m51s)

[will know that I am very happy to Rabbit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m53s)

[Trail and answer questions as as they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m55s)

[come up so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m57s)

[whatever questions you got I'm I can't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h28m58s)

[guarantee I'll know the answer but I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m01s)

[happy to try](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m02s)

[um yeah I will say on a lot of event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m06s)

[handlers and WPF it is a little unusual](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m08s)

[to go after the sender](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m11s)

[it's not completely uncommon to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m15s)

[something like this I've seen this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m17s)

[pattern a lot but most of the time when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m18s)

[I see this sample it's people who have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m20s)

[come out of Windows forms and there and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m22s)

[this is what they were taught to do the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m25s)

[other thing is is this if statement is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m28s)

[kind of meaningless with this one here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m30s)

[because you get identical Behavior](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m33s)

[omitting it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m35s)

[because if this is null the cast fails](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m37s)

[this is null and then you're going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m40s)

[jump out of this as well the other thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m41s)

[to be aware of is oftentimes with newer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m43s)

[c-sharp syntax you don't want to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m46s)

[equals equals null](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m48s)

[a stronger idea is to do an is null](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m55s)

[so these ones here are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h29m57s)

[so the equals equals null the reason](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m00s)

[it's generally less preferable is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m02s)

[because the double equals operator can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m05s)

[be overridden now in this case it's not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m06s)

[going to be a big deal you're going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m09s)

[get reference equality this is an object](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m10s)

[but in general I usually tell people if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m12s)

[you want to do a reference equality](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m15s)

[against null an is null is better](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m17s)

[older versions of C sharp they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m23s)

[the recommendation was reference equals](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m24s)

[which is a static method on object](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m27s)

[to be explicit about uh null checks but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m30s)

[you'll note here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m33s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m34s)

[um the the analyzers are already hinting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m37s)

[to you hey there's a much simpler syntax](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m39s)

[uh 156 method can you rewrite and show](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m48s)

[um I might need I might need some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m49s)

[feedback on what that is I'm not sure](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m51s)

[what 156 method](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m52s)

[is referring to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m55s)

[oh this one here the text box lost focus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m56s)

[on line 156](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h30m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m01s)

[yeah so let's see here if this if I was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m02s)

[going through and rewriting it I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m05s)

[wouldn't be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m06s)

[I I generally wouldn't be looking at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m08s)

[this so because this isn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m12s)

[this is an event handler method](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m13s)

[coming from the the text box field](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m15s)

[um I would probably drop all of this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m20s)

[um and I would be doing something more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m25s)

[akin to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m27s)

[um if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m29s)

[uh text box field is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m31s)

[Xbox again I I like my pattern matching](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m34s)

[and then I would bring something like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m37s)

[this up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m40s)

[and do text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m41s)

[so I would probably rewrite it more akin](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m44s)

[to this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m47s)

[and again this validate input method is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m51s)

[just the one that does a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m53s)

[a tripart and I might want to take a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m55s)

[closer look at this it's taking in a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h31m58s)

[parameter of an object](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m00s)

[and the only reason it's taking in an](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m07s)

[object is because it's being invoked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m09s)

[from both here and down here so it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m12s)

[it's abusing the fact that integer two](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m16s)

[string and string two string are going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m18s)

[to get you similar results](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m21s)

[um if this wasn't an integer there's a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m24s)

[potential flaw here as well because the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m27s)

[two string method is going to be culture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m30s)

[specific](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m32s)

[it doesn't bite usually as hard on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m33s)

[integers but it will certainly bite you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m36s)

[on doubles](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m39s)

[I usually enjoy picking on French](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m41s)

[because that's one of the easy languages](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m43s)

[that I know that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m45s)

[um the the decimal separator is a comma](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m47s)

[rather than a period as it is in English](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m51s)

[and oftentimes I'll see people make](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m54s)

[assumptions about the decimal separator](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m57s)

[being a period and that's a horrible](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h32m59s)

[thing to do don't do that the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m00s)

[the workaround is usually just to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m04s)

[specify](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m06s)

[um culture info and be explicit about](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m07s)

[what culture you expect right the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m09s)

[drawback here is you can't specify](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m11s)

[culture info on object to string](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m12s)

[but there is a culture override on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m15s)

[things like into string right so if I go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m19s)

[value to string this guy here thank you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m21s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m25s)

[um does have a an I format provider](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m27s)

[people often see iport format provider](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m30s)

[and don't realize what the implementing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m33s)

[class is for that interface the common](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m35s)

[one for I format provider is usually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m38s)

[culture info so if you see an I format](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m40s)

[provider in an API just mentally think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m43s)

[ah culture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m46s)

[so there's a there's a lot of apis that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m49s)

[leverage it typically around like the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m52s)

[numeric parsing methods uh I think gwyd](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m54s)

[has it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m57s)

[um a lot of two string Methods will take](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h33m59s)

[in a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m01s)

[uh I format provider for doing culture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m03s)

[specific formatting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m05s)

[okay increase button on click](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m07s)

[um I don't know that you actually need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m12s)

[to Mark the event as handled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m14s)

[I don't think you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m19s)

[it's it's not hurting anything but the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m21s)

[underlying button will will already do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m25s)

[that for you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m28s)

[so this is probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m29s)

[not needed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m33s)

[okay so let's see increase decrease](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m34s)

[okay so here for the command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m38s)

[they uh your it's passing through the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m41s)

[value of this so the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m44s)

[um the I command interface wants to have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m46s)

[a a parameter of type object](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m50s)

[the intent though is for that object to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m54s)

[either be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m57s)

[um some parameter specified here so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h34m59s)

[ideally what we would probably do is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m02s)

[either have the command parameter be the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m05s)

[value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m08s)

[or even better would be a second](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m11s)

[dependency property that's increased](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m13s)

[command parameter and that way it can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m15s)

[feed through that way if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m18s)

[it to be uh value they can just data](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m20s)

[bind that in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m22s)

[but passing this is probably incorrect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m24s)

[if there's not a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m27s)

[a parameter to pass typically for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m30s)

[commands you would end up passing just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m33s)

[null](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m34s)

[um and I also would probably do the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m36s)

[well I'm trying to think would you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m41s)

[the increment before the command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m43s)

[I think the answer is yes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m49s)

[because I think on things like radio](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m52s)

[button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h35m56s)

[I want to look real quick I think radio](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m02s)

[button when you toggle the unchecked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m04s)

[uh oh darn you uh let's see take me to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m09s)

[Papa](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m15s)

[you here it's there go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m21s)

[I believe it sets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m25s)

[the the check State and then invokes the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m28s)

[command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m31s)

[uh let's see register unregister ungroup](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m34s)

[name on checked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m40s)

[update radio button group so this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m44s)

[going to go through and do the check](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m46s)

[state of all the things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m47s)

[and check radio button move all of those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m50s)

[that's all fine that's all fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m53s)

[and then based on checked and I think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h36m58s)

[this is what's going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m01s)

[that's raising the event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m06s)

[where is the command triggered from](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m09s)

[trying to remember where the command is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m13s)

[where in the hierarchy it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m15s)

[uh button base ah so that's going to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m18s)

[down further](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m22s)

[I'm fairly confident you want to do the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m25s)

[value increment first](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m28s)

[and the command second](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m31s)

[because typically if you fire off the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m34s)

[command the consumer of the command is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m36s)

[pro the first thing that they're going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m38s)

[to want is what's the current value and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m39s)

[so you want to be able to grab that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m42s)

[same thing for decrease effectively the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m50s)

[same thing this should become null or a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m53s)

[dependency property reference and this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m56s)

[should probably occur first](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h37m58s)

[um I am noticing a minor code thing here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m01s)

[as well there is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m04s)

[there's some duplicated logic here where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m07s)

[validate input is restricting it as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m09s)

[as this thing here so the nice part is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m13s)

[if the Min maximum we're done is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m16s)

[coerce method on the dependency property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m20s)

[of value you wouldn't need this logic in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m23s)

[here you'd literally just do value minus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m26s)

[minus equals one and you're done](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m28s)

[so we'll check that okay so preview key](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m32s)

[down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m35s)

[and in these cases you do need to Mark](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m36s)

[these as handled otherwise the text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m38s)

[will do it so this is using preview key](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m40s)

[down so in WPF there's two events when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m43s)

[you hit a key two things or two events](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m46s)

[happen the preview event starts at your](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m49s)

[window and walks through the visual tree](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m51s)

[down to where your text box is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m53s)

[the text box then handles that key press](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m56s)

[so the the on the way down the tunneling](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h38m58s)

[event is the all the events that start](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m01s)

[with the word preview](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m04s)

[once the control that in this case the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m05s)

[text box handles it it then fires](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m07s)

[another event called key down that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m10s)

[bubbles from the text box back up to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m12s)

[window so that's the tunneling versus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m15s)

[bubbling events and by marking something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m17s)

[is handled it means most controls uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m20s)

[either on the way down or on the way up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m24s)

[won't see the event you can still say](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m26s)

[hey I want all events even if they've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m29s)

[been marked as handled but by default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m30s)

[unless you've used the API that lets you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m32s)

[set that flag which you have to be very](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m35s)

[explicit about by default you'll only](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m38s)

[get vents events that are unhandled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m40s)

[so in this case just hijacking it and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m43s)

[then marking it as handled so that the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m45s)

[text box doesn't try to do anything with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m47s)

[it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m50s)

[well this is interesting they did handle](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m51s)

[scroll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m54s)

[hmm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m56s)

[well let's play with it real quick and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h39m58s)

[see how it goes and then we'll come back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m00s)

[and clean up a little this code](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m02s)

[so I'm I'm curious the the mouse wheel](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m09s)

[is interesting I don't know if that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m12s)

[expected Behavior or not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m14s)

[I'm a little torn I I could kind of go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m18s)

[either way especially since this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m21s)

[this is on oh this has zero references](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m24s)

[both oh but these are overrides because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m28s)

[this is on the control this feels](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m32s)

[awkward I I'd almost want the mouse](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m34s)

[wheel event if we were going to do it to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m36s)

[only be on the text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m38s)

[okay let's see let's see so there should](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m40s)

[be a numeric up down great that one okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m42s)

[so I can go Plus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m46s)

[and go minus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m49s)

[and it works I mean that's and I can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m51s)

[come in here and I can type you know 42](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m54s)

[because that's obviously the right](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m55s)

[answer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m57s)

[great let's just look at this the setup](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h40m58s)

[for this is about as stupid simple as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m02s)

[you can get it might be nice to have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m04s)

[sample that has the min max set on it as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m06s)

[well just so that people can experience](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m08s)

[what that's like not a huge deal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m15s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m17s)

[Mouse Wheel Works but here's the other](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m18s)

[thing Mouse Wheel Works even if I'm over](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m21s)

[here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m22s)

[that feels weird to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m26s)

[I think the mouse wheel Behavior I don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m28s)

[I don't mind it but I would probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m31s)

[only expect it to trigger](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m34s)

[when my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m39s)

[when my cursor is over the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m41s)

[um the text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m45s)

[I think that would be my expectation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m48s)

[and then let's see if I go here and I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m53s)

[just do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m56s)

[keyboard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h41m57s)

[it is interesting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m04s)

[like I get why it's happening because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m07s)

[you're changing the text boxes text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m09s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m14s)

[a clever trick that could be done there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m19s)

[uh where is it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m22s)

[yeah so on value changed it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m26s)

[going through and doing this and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m30s)

[actually I don't even know if you need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m32s)

[this event handler](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m33s)

[okay let's clean some of this up I think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m35s)

[I think we can do let's let's see what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m37s)

[the end result should probably look like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m39s)

[so I don't think we need this event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m41s)

[handler let's jump into here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m42s)

[uh actually I want the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m44s)

[numeric up down Style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m47s)

[which I guess we should probably verify](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m50s)

[that because the style itself I believe](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m53s)

[is pretty basic](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h42m59s)

[um yeah so inside of the control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m01s)

[template and this is a very very](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m03s)

[simplistic one but it's roughly what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m05s)

[you'd expect it's a dock panel one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m07s)

[button is dock left one button's docked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m10s)

[right the content's set here so if I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m12s)

[were to do this I would probably invert](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m14s)

[these and go right left](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m16s)

[all right I just picture like a number](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m18s)

[line further left goes minus further up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m20s)

[goes there the template bindings are set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m23s)

[here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m26s)

[oh look at that there is a template](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m29s)

[binding for text so we shouldn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m31s)

[realistically need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m33s)

[well and horizontal oh this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m37s)

[horizontal content alignment okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m40s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m42s)

[this is setting doc top](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m45s)

[I don't think you need this because the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m48s)

[default behavior for a dock panel](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m51s)

[and this has got a Min width of 50.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h43m54s)

[I think what I would do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m00s)

[is I would not have this Min width be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m04s)

[here and I would just use the mid width](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m06s)

[on the style Setter itself just so that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m09s)

[the control has a reasonable minimum](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m11s)

[however the advantage of doing it just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m13s)

[in the style Setter is that it then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m16s)

[allows](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m19s)

[um somebody using the style to override](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m21s)

[your minimum if they don't like it if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m23s)

[you hard code it in anything that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m25s)

[hard-coded inside of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m27s)

[um the template quickly becomes uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m31s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m34s)

[because it's it's not easily](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m39s)

[overrideable by anyone else uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m40s)

[grid column zero isn't needed because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m43s)

[we're not inside of a grid so that does](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m45s)

[nothing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m47s)

[we'll we'll whack that let's see Corner](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m48s)

[radius is here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m51s)

[um I almost wonder if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m53s)

[Corner radius should end up being a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h44m57s)

[a dependency property on numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m03s)

[the other thing is is I don't think you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m08s)

[want to set font size things with font](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m10s)

[are usually expected to be set higher up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m13s)

[and inherit down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m15s)

[oh and then the the thing with dock](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m19s)

[panel is dock panel default is last](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m21s)

[child fill](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m24s)

[so this property here if we jump to it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m25s)

[uh of course it's not going to show it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m30s)

[to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m32s)

[let's see F4](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m34s)

[uh let's see last child fill oh I should](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m38s)

[probably turn this off](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m42s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m47s)

[false true but you'll note if I clear it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m49s)

[default value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m54s)

[why are why are you not uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h45m57s)

[yeah default value is checked for true](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m01s)

[so the last child by default here is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m04s)

[going to fill the remaining space so I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m07s)

[think you can get away with this and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m09s)

[then I I think what we can do here is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m11s)

[pack icon](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m13s)

[kind uh Plus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m15s)

[and I don't know if these are exactly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m19s)

[the right icons that we would want but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m24s)

[I think we would probably want something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m29s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m32s)

[yeah and I don't even know if you need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m36s)

[to set a minimum height](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m38s)

[the only reason you might want to set a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m43s)

[minimum width is to keep that middle](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m45s)

[text box from just being collapsed on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m47s)

[but let's give that a try because I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m52s)

[don't think you end up needing this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m54s)

[numeric up down value change to set the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m56s)

[text box text because you are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h46m58s)

[template binding directly into value you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m02s)

[don't need to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m04s)

[the the template binding will update](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m06s)

[automatically for you now if it's not I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m10s)

[have a feeling I know why it may not be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m13s)

[defaulting to a two-way binding yeah so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m16s)

[that minimum width there is probably not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m18s)

[big enough](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m21s)

[uh Min width](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m23s)

[80.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m26s)

[okay 200 what's the right value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m28s)

[00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,660](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m34s)

are you updating or not that's what I

[thought you're not updating properly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m38s)

[okay fine Snoop come here I need you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m39s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m44s)

[do your thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m47s)

[let's look at this guy and then I want](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m48s)

[to go up to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m50s)

[numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m54s)

[let's see Min width](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m56s)

[and let's do 200 that's too big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h47m59s)

[00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:11,160](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m03s)

it's a little small 120.

[a little small 130.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m08s)

[probably good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m11s)

[two digit number](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m12s)

[it's probably not too bad at all so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m16s)

[120 give or take a little bit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m20s)

[might be a reasonable starting point and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m24s)

[then oh I'm sorry 130 is what we did](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m26s)

[and then I think these pack I these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m29s)

[buttons might need to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m32s)

[theoretically styled down a little bit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m35s)

[because I think these guys here have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m37s)

[padding set on them by default that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m39s)

[might just need to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m41s)

[dialed back so if we go down here to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m48s)

[these guys here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m54s)

[uh let's see I think there's a padding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h48m56s)

[uh that's uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m01s)

[move me up to the button yeah so the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m04s)

[default Style on the raised button is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m07s)

[little big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m10s)

[and ultimately I think we should](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m11s)

[probably be applying a different style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m13s)

[to these buttons to kind of clean them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m15s)

[up but I would probably dial them down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m16s)

[to be more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m18s)

[maybe even like a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m23s)

[an eight four](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m25s)

[or something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m27s)

[yeah because having having the padding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m32s)

[on those things be set to like eight](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m33s)

[fours probably a little closer to to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m35s)

[getting a nice Square setup](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m38s)

[or square-ish setup at least for default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m41s)

[and again the the thicker padding that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m44s)

[on there is because they're these are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m46s)

[used in the default raised material](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m48s)

[design button Style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m50s)

[which we've got a bunch of them so if we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m52s)

[look at the buttons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m55s)

[so there by default Landing here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h49m58s)

[but we could do we could do a couple](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m01s)

[options it might even be nice to do like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m03s)

[the flatter button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m07s)

[because the difference is and it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m10s)

[harder to see in the dark theme if we go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m11s)

[light theme it's a little more obvious](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m13s)

[uh toggle there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m15s)

[um this one here you can let's see do I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m18s)

[have I don't have zoom to run okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m21s)

[this guy here you can see the shadow](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m26s)

[underneath it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m28s)

[whereas this one down here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m30s)

[there's no shadow](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m35s)

[it may be nicer to not use the shadow](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m37s)

[one and maybe use this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m41s)

[flat button on it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m43s)

[I could possibly go I don't know if I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m47s)

[really sold too much on it the other](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m49s)

[thing is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m51s)

[even though we've set up this repeat](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m53s)

[button here I think a behavior more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m55s)

[people are going to want rather than the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m58s)

[Left Right buttons there or potentially](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h50m59s)

[stacked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m01s)

[which is probably a potential for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m03s)

[another](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m05s)

[control template in here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m06s)

[um I don't know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m10s)

[background and foreground are probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m12s)

[irrelevant too](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m14s)

[and actually Min height is probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m17s)

[irrelevant](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m19s)

[oh no problems any music good luck like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m27s)

[I said feel free to drop in any time](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m29s)

[with questions](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m31s)

[yeah I think we probably don't need most](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m37s)

[of those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m39s)

[thingies set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m41s)

[and that'll get us a lot closer yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m45s)

[something something a little more akin](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m49s)

[to that and I I think that'll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m51s)

[that'll be a lot closer and again the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m55s)

[it's one of those this is a new control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h51m58s)

[I don't and it's not something that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m01s)

[actually exists in the material that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m03s)

[design spec so it's not like there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m05s)

[anything that I really have to go on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m08s)

[there's not there's not a WPF control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m09s)

[that I can be that I can go prior art on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m12s)

[there's not a material design spec for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m15s)

[it so it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m17s)

[on some hand uh on one hand we're kind](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m19s)

[of free to do what we want with it on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m23s)

[the other hand](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m25s)

[I'm trying to be somewhat](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m26s)

[I hate releasing things and then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m29s)

[breaking changes another version later](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m34s)

[yeah so that's that's fine you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m43s)

[technically none of those are needed but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m45s)

[yeah I this is going to end up being the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m47s)

[default here uh one other thing I would](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m50s)

[probably do is give this guy a key of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m54s)

[something like material design](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h52m58s)

[numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m01s)

[um we generally reserve the implicit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m05s)

[Styles which is what the ones without a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m07s)

[key are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m09s)

[for being inside of the defaults](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m10s)

[um here so you'll note that the whole](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m18s)

[point of the defaults](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m20s)

[section is to provide all of the default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m22s)

[Styles so oftentimes this is where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m26s)

[you'll get the implicit one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m29s)

[that way as long as the user loads up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m31s)

[the defaults dictionary they get all the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m34s)

[things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m36s)

[done](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m38s)

[right not a bit not a big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m39s)

[a big deal there's a couple of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m42s)

[controls I know we haven't been overly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m44s)

[consistent where the defaults are stored](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m45s)

[somewhere else](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m48s)

[but that is probably a worthwhile thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m49s)

[there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m53s)

[um but overall so let's see this guy can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m54s)

[go away](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m57s)

[we don't need that we don't need that we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h53m59s)

[don't need that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m01s)

[um lost Focus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m03s)

[I don't even think you need this anymore](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m06s)

[um and you won't need to do this setup](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m12s)

[because the template will do all of that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m15s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m18s)

[so you don't actually need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m20s)

[anything with the text box I don't think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m23s)

[which does beg the question should it be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m27s)

[declared as part of your template or not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m29s)

[I think the answer is yes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m31s)

[I think the answer is yes let's let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m34s)

[write up the coalesce bit here too](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m37s)

[real quick just to show it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m40s)

[and I do appreciate the the good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m47s)

[commanding implementation some people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m49s)

[just blindly call execute which is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m51s)

[hundred percent incorrect you should](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m54s)

[check can execute and then call execute](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m55s)

[okay so let's just confirm that this uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h54m58s)

[Merrick up down works as expected](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m02s)

[clearly not excellent oh it doesn't work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m04s)

[as expected because I gave the thing a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m07s)

[key and then didn't make a default style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m10s)

[for it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m12s)

[so that's not going to work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m14s)

[Style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m15s)

[you got to learn how to type correctly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m17s)

[style target type uh let's see X Type](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m19s)

[uh local actually you know what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m24s)

[should save ourselves some headache](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m29s)

[uh you go away](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m31s)

[you come back I'm just going to drop the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m33s)

[key that way I don't have to think too](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m35s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m37s)

[there save yourself a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m40s)

[little bit of trouble](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m43s)

[okay so why do you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m54s)

[I will say](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h55m58s)

[despite the operating system being](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m00s)

[called Windows sometimes its windowing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m02s)

[system is the biggest frustration](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m08s)

[stand by](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m09s)

[lungs need hydration](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m11s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m16s)

[my family was gifted a large container](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m19s)

[of fruit punch](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m24s)

[and my wife informed me that neither hit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m25s)

[her nor my kids like it and so it is on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m28s)

[me to consume it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m31s)

[and so I am bravely suffering through it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m33s)

[suffering okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m40s)

[uh Numerica](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m42s)

[okay so that got me there but that has](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m45s)

[now broken my setup so something is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m48s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m51s)

[because when I update this value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m54s)

[something is not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h56m57s)

[increasing decreasing appropriately](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m00s)

[so why why you no work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m03s)

[so let's let's track that down real](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m07s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m09s)

[because you shouldn't need to do oh I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m10s)

[bet you I know why it's probably the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m14s)

[two-way binding problem](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m16s)

[so if we go numeric up down and we look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m18s)

[at value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m20s)

[value is being increased right I click](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m22s)

[the button so the value of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m24s)

[dependency property is going up and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m27s)

[but the value in the text box is not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m29s)

[being updated](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m31s)

[the likely culprit here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m33s)

[is the dependency property of value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m36s)

[yeah so this guy here rather than](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m41s)

[property metadata there is a framework](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m45s)

[property metadata](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m48s)

[and it comes with a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m50s)

[we want this guy here so framework](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m54s)

[uh property metadata options and there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h57m59s)

[a there's so there's a bunch of stuff in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m03s)

[here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m05s)

[that are worth knowing about but the by](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m07s)

[far the most common one out of that list](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m09s)

[is binds to a by default so anytime you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m13s)

[have a dependency property and you do a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m17s)

[binding to it the mode of that binding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m20s)

[is determined by the Target dependency](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m22s)

[property itself](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m26s)

[so when you do a binding if you don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m27s)

[set mode explicitly you have no idea](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m30s)

[what the mode of that binding is without](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m33s)

[looking at the dependency property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m35s)

[the basic guidance is if the property is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m37s)

[something that's user interactable like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m41s)

[the text property of a text box for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m43s)

[example the expectation is that defaults](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m46s)

[to a two-way binding telleric take notes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m49s)

[it should default to a two-way binding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m52s)

[if it is something like a command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h58m56s)

[that isn't expected to have that kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m00s)

[user inter user does a thing and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m03s)

[therefore something changes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m05s)

[then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m07s)

[being One Way by default is perfectly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m08s)

[fine and if you don't set this binds](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m11s)

[two-way by default you get a one-way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m14s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m18s)

[if you would rather be a two-way binding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m19s)

[the solution is go from property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m22s)

[metadata to framework property metadata](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m24s)

[and use the overloaded Constructor that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m27s)

[takes in the enu](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m29s)

[another case where you might use that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m31s)

[enume is if you've got a dependency](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m33s)

[property that should trigger like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m35s)

[updates to render or layout](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m38s)

[so if you have any of those also set the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m42s)

[union value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m44s)

[accordingly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m45s)

[okay now we go here we go here we go up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m47s)

[up up oh it's no worky no worky why you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m50s)

[no bind](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m54s)

[why you no bind](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m55s)

[you're supposed to work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=00h59m59s)

[that whole lesson for it to not be the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m00s)

[full solution](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m03s)

[but never fear we will find we will we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m05s)

[will find and track this down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m07s)

[to do so there's the text box that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m10s)

[what I'm interested in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m13s)

[text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m14s)

[it's interesting that this thing doesn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m19s)

[show a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m21s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m23s)

[so I can't say for certain](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m26s)

[that I'm surprised](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m30s)

[we got rid of all of the underlying text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m34s)

[box stuff yeah this guy's now completely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m37s)

[unused](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m39s)

[that's coming in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m44s)

[you click the button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m47s)

[the value should be incrementing and if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m50s)

[I look up here at the numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m54s)

[and I look at value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h00m56s)

[to do the value is bigger](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m10s)

[I have a theory](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m14s)

[I have a theory](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m17s)

[uh okay so this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m21s)

[it's a current value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m25s)

[uh let's see value property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m28s)

[Value Plus One](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m32s)

[I have a theory](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m39s)

[I have a theory](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m42s)

[oh that's not gonna compile semicolons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m45s)

[are important in this language yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m47s)

[I get it I get it I get it semicolons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m49s)

[needed hush](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m51s)

[trust me just do what I tell you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h01m53s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m03s)

[at some point](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m04s)

[I'm going to set this up so that I have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m09s)

[Auto jumping between these two 42](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m11s)

[didn't set again interesting okay back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m16s)

[into here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m23s)

[so we're gonna go back up to here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m27s)

[text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m30s)

[it's really shocking to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m35s)

[uh command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m38s)

[value source is coming from the parent](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m44s)

[template see this is what I'm expecting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m46s)

[is things laid out via the parent](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m49s)

[template whereas here when I look at the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m51s)

[text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m54s)

[I get default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h02m56s)

[something isn't working the way I expect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m01s)

[something is not working the way that I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m09s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m12s)

[and I am not sure what it is yet](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m19s)

[I'm almost one I'm also thinking that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m22s)

[this thing probably should have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m24s)

[uh let's see padding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m27s)

[template by new padding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m31s)

[sorry I just noticed the corner radius](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m39s)

[was defaulting to 10.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m40s)

[and if you don't put any padding on that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m43s)

[it's going to bite you though it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m45s)

[questionable whether it should have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m47s)

[default padding of eight or not but at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m49s)

[least](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m51s)

[now it's controllable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m53s)

[why](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h03m56s)

[okay let's let's go back over this here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m01s)

[real quick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m03s)

[still eight references is one of them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m06s)

[oh there's still a value assignment here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m11s)

[I shouldn't have that I shouldn't need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m16s)

[that okay let's go back up here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m18s)

[just want to see the references show](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m21s)

[them to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m23s)

[okay so there's the only](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m26s)

[things accessing this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m29s)

[let's get rid of this because that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m34s)

[shouldn't be needed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m37s)

[once we get to the rest of it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m38s)

[on property changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m46s)

[yes this is all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m54s)

[doing what I would expect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h04m57s)

[I'm just now confused why my template](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m01s)

[binding isn't behaving the way I expect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m03s)

[and I I feel like this is something I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m11s)

[should know the answer to and I've just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m13s)

[missed something but yeah so that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m15s)

[padding is now obviously messed up my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m17s)

[Min width which now needs to be another](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m20s)

[16 points above so that's probably more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m23s)

[like 150.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m28s)

[should we launch that real quick and see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m34s)

[why are you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m37s)

[off here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m41s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m44s)

[let's add in something like eight four](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m46s)

[comma four](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m51s)

[um on both of these guys](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m53s)

[that'll that'll clean up the sizing a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h05m57s)

[little bit as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m00s)

[probably will let me reduce this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m02s)

[I'm guessing it'll look a little big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m08s)

[I would love to add some yeah that's a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m14s)

[little big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m17s)

[but the buttons look a little nicer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h06m21s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m27s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m29s)

[text change loss Focus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m38s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m45s)

[because I am an idiot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m48s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m50s)

[because we're not binding something from](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m52s)

[the outside in we're needing to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m54s)

[propagate the inside value out okay okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h08m57s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m02s)

[so I'm just a [ __ ] that's okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m05s)

[sometimes it happens](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m08s)

[uh okay so let's see here we need to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m10s)

[uh let's see discard discard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m14s)

[and I want to do something akin to this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m19s)

[discard selection](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m21s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m24s)

[let's see on value changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m30s)

[we probably want to do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m36s)

[I'm not sure we want to register for it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m43s)

[here okay let's start with that now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m46s)

[we've got it back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m51s)

[I think we want to deal with it up here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m54s)

[so we've got on value changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h09m57s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m01s)

[coerce value changed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m04s)

[uh how about coerced value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m09s)

[well that's uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m13s)

[right uh covers](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m16s)

[numeric value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m19s)

[and how about we rename you to on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m22s)

[numeric value change just for symmetry](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m25s)

[why is it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m28s)

[cannot rename this oh I'm debugging and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m31s)

[it's lost its mind got it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m33s)

[got it got it got it got it got it got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m38s)

[it let's see on yeah yeah yeah go ahead](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m39s)

[and yell at me I get it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m45s)

[uh cool](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m49s)

[there we go coerced numeric value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m52s)

[pseudo make me a method thank you okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m56s)

[so let's let's get a couple things fixed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h10m59s)

[up right away because we've already got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m01s)

[a couple things going going all kinds of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m03s)

[walking mode so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m05s)

[if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m10s)

[uh I prefer to call this value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m12s)

[if value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m14s)

[uh value is int uh numeric value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m16s)

[uh value gets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m23s)

[effectively I I want to do the stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m26s)

[that was happening here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m28s)

[I want to do right about here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m31s)

[and I want to go boom boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m35s)

[and then we want to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m39s)

[return numeric value otherwise return](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m42s)

[value because who knows what it was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m45s)

[we'll just let it through okay and so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m47s)

[here you'll know we don't have access to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m49s)

[maximum and minimum because we are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m51s)

[inside of a static member](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m53s)

[um there's a couple ways we could go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m56s)

[about doing this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h11m58s)

[we could do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m00s)

[D to get value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m03s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m08s)

[as good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m09s)

[but I think it will just we'll just cast](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m12s)

[here if D is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m14s)

[uh numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m17s)

[America up down and right so something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m20s)

[like that and now we have access to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m24s)

[these guys](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m28s)

[cannot convert from int to byte](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m32s)

[well that's just because you're dumb](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m36s)

[there happy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m39s)

[okay so now we have the coerce done](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m41s)

[this is now our sun our centralized](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m44s)

[place where we're going to have our](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m47s)

[course](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m48s)

[perfect that'll handle it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m50s)

[we've got one spot no more thinking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m52s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m55s)

[the next one is is on numeric value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h12m56s)

[changed and I generally like putting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m00s)

[the value changed methods next to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m05s)

[dependency properties that's just my own](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m08s)

[minor preference](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m11s)

[um so we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m13s)

[I think I want to I'm gonna start the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m14s)

[same way here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m17s)

[all right boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m20s)

[and I think we then this saves us on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m22s)

[this we no longer need that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m27s)

[numeric up down great perfect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m30s)

[okay so that can raise the event but the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m32s)

[other thing that we want to do when this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m36s)

[changes is we want to do numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m37s)

[DOT text box field](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m41s)

[null checking dot text gets uh e dot new](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m45s)

[value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m50s)

[to string](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m55s)

[uh oh right so that doesn't work uh if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h13m59s)

[numeric up down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m03s)

[text box field is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m07s)

[Xbox](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m11s)

[all right then we'll just bring this guy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m13s)

[up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m14s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m16s)

[go back thank you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m18s)

[text box dot text gets that and I think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m21s)

[what we're going to do here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m25s)

[is we know this isn't it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m27s)

[wasn't the cast above would have failed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m30s)

[and then I think here we want to be a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m34s)

[little more intelligent about our two](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m36s)

[string](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m49s)

[because we could go after the language](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m54s)

[that way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h14m56s)

[but I think it were just as good off](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m00s)

[doing uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m03s)

[and this is going to be specific current](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m04s)

[UI culture because this is something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m06s)

[that's actually being displayed that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m09s)

[likely the intent](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m12s)

[okay so that goes there that goes there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m16s)

[validate input should then be dead](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m19s)

[which it is we don't need to watch text](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m22s)

[change here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m25s)

[we don't need](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m27s)

[these guys we probably still need this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m30s)

[but I want to do the same culture info](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m35s)

[current UI culture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m40s)

[okay and then that means here we don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m47s)

[need this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m50s)

[and it should just work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h15m54s)

[hey Andrew](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m10s)

[great question uh so at the moment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m12s)

[I am poking at boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m16s)

[this PR here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m19s)

[so it's bringing in a new numeric up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m22s)

[down control into the material design](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m26s)

[Library](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m28s)

[um I will mention that the the the guy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m30s)

[who put out the pr](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m33s)

[um did message me on Discord and let me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m35s)

[know that he's new to WPF and this is a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m38s)

[learning experience so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m40s)

[I'm learning a little bit too as I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m43s)

[remember all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m45s)

[but playing around with it just so that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m48s)

[we can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m50s)

[uh leave good PR feedback okay so that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m52s)

[now works that now works that works](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h16m56s)

[cool the Min width is probably a little](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m00s)

[big now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m03s)

[that's probably way too big for that I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m05s)

[mean width and now I should be able to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m07s)

[also do something like 42](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m09s)

[oh 42 didn't submit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m11s)

[we probably do still want to handle the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m17s)

[text change on that don't we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m19s)

[I think I probably do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m21s)

[so disappointing so disappointing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m29s)

[let's go up here real quick let's play](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m30s)

[with the Min width for a moment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m32s)

[uh let's see 130 Maybe](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m35s)

[still a little big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m41s)

[there's no reason it needs to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m42s)

[any bigger than it has to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m45s)

[yeah something like that is probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m55s)

[fine I am also curious if we do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m57s)

[something with the Border because the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h17m59s)

[Border isn't being set at all but if we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m01s)

[do something like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m03s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m05s)

[do you not let me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m07s)

[really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m09s)

[Snoop I thought you had a Color Picker](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m12s)

[there we go I was like I could have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m16s)

[sworn we had one and then border](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m17s)

[thickness of two](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m19s)

[right so it does have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m21s)

[a border](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m23s)

[I'm now wondering if maybe I set that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m25s)

[padding a little too high too](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m27s)

[can we get away with four](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m31s)

[I don't know if it matters that much](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m39s)

[we're gonna dial it down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m48s)

[do you think architecture in W uh PF is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m51s)

[hard I always overthink when designing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m54s)

[my app](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m58s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h18m59s)

[so there's a couple things I think that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m01s)

[go into it one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m04s)

[you have to remember how old WPF is like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m07s)

[WPF predates a lot of language features](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m11s)

[in c-sharp that we would just consider](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m14s)

[ubiquitous now like little things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m15s)

[generics](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m18s)

[weren't a thing when WPF was first](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m20s)

[released](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m23s)

[um so to some degree WPF is difficult](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m25s)

[because it's also old and due to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m30s)

[insistence that we never break backwards](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m34s)

[compatibility](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m36s)

[some of the old Legacy stuff is still](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m39s)

[floating around there just the a bit of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m41s)

[docs from 10 years ago that are still](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m46s)

[perfectly valid and great to work with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m48s)

[pluses and minuses both ways](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m51s)

[but there are certain things inside of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m54s)

[it that make it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m57s)

[somewhat difficult to do so it was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h19m59s)

[designed with an mvvm architecture as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m02s)

[the as the intent because win forms was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m06s)

[its predecessor it kind of had bindings](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m10s)

[but bindings and win forms for anyone](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m13s)

[who's done them weren't they never](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m15s)

[really felt like first class things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m17s)

[you you oftentimes did your your UI to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m20s)

[data synchronization manually with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m23s)

[events and code behind and that kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m25s)

[thing whereas WPF xaml first class](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m27s)

[citizen it's designed to operate that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m30s)

[way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m32s)

[when I'm teaching people like mvvm and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m34s)

[structuring apps I usually tell them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m38s)

[this is a steep learning curve it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m41s)

[worth it but it's a steep learning curve](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m43s)

[um because you're throwing somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m47s)

[right into the deep end even though](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m49s)

[I've done this for so long it just feels](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m52s)

[normal and natural](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m54s)

[uh thanks for the sub](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m55s)

[um it feels natural to me but it's not a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h20m58s)

[lot of developers this is not normal to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m03s)

[them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m04s)

[like people who come to Maui or whatnot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m05s)

[it doesn't quite track even if they're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m07s)

[used to doing layouts in an XML type](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m10s)

[situation like maybe coming from Android](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m13s)

[it's still not that nvvm architecture is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m15s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m20s)

[and then you put things like dependency](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m22s)

[injection and testability on top of that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m24s)

[and brains explode because there's a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m27s)

[of there's a lot of pieces and WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m32s)

[doesn't necessarily steer you in the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m35s)

[right direction it kind of is more like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m37s)

[a blank canvas and says paint what you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m39s)

[want](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m42s)

[rather than you know giving you nice](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m43s)

[lines and saying here you probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m45s)

[should paint inside the lines](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m48s)

[it gives you none of that it's you have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m50s)

[at it good luck and you're Off to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m53s)

[Races](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m57s)

[there's several libraries around that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h21m58s)

[that try to deal with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m01s)

[some of the awkwardness of the structure](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m03s)

[like prisms a very popular one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m05s)

[um I'll let me do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m08s)

[let me point out one more so I I have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m11s)

[been annoyed I do a bunch of WPF apps](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m15s)

[um and I have gotten very annoyed with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m19s)

[how difficult it is whenever I spin up a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m21s)

[new app because WPF doesn't have all the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m25s)

[things in the box that I need like it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m28s)

[was designed for mvvm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m30s)

[but they didn't give you very many of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m32s)

[the pieces they give you eye command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m34s)

[they didn't give you a good command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m37s)

[implementation to use in your view](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m38s)

[models so there's even though you may](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m39s)

[start a project to do it well you have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m42s)

[to bring in extra stuff so I started](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m44s)

[a.net template feedback welcome if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m47s)

[people have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m50s)

[feedback on what they would want so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m52s)

[there's a couple things in here that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m54s)

[I've been poking at and I keep revving](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m56s)

[it and improving as I find things on it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h22m58s)

[but if you are looking for how](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m00s)

[my current thinking on how I like to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m04s)

[structure WPF apps this is my starting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m07s)

[point](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m09s)

[so there is a lot of stuff bundled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m10s)

[inside of this template](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m14s)

[um okay let me just show it off real](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m17s)

[quick let me show it off real quick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m19s)

[CD temp uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m21s)

[uh let's go with uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m24s)

[uh WPF demo right uh WPF demo](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m29s)

[uh dot net new](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m34s)

[WPF boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m38s)

[boom so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m45s)

[so it comes with a bunch of stuff out of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m49s)

[the box already set up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m51s)

[and again this is this is Kevin's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m53s)

[preferred way of setting up and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m55s)

[structuring architecture in the app and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m57s)

[it doesn't get you all the way there but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h23m59s)

[it in my mind it gets me pretty close](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m02s)

[there's a few more things I actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m04s)

[want to add to this and I may make a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m05s)

[second WPF demo because there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m07s)

[common things that I found myself doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m12s)

[like stuff with HTTP client this demo](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m14s)

[doesn't dive that deep and it's like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m17s)

[well I kind of want to have a template](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m20s)

[that also has like HTTP client with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m22s)

[things like poly already set up and all](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m24s)

[of that extra stuff so the the key one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m26s)

[of the key things to note is the way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m30s)

[that it does its startup is it does have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m32s)

[an overridden Main and it's using the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m35s)

[newer generic host pattern](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m38s)

[for actually going through and doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m40s)

[um dependency injection to set up so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m44s)

[anybody who's done asp.net core this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m45s)

[will feel familiar because that's where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m48s)

[the the pattern started](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m51s)

[oh thank you again feedback welcome I've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m53s)

[I've found bugs in my template I've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m56s)

[tweaked things I've changed things again](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h24m58s)

[this is every time I spin a new app I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m01s)

[use my template and each time I go you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m03s)

[know I want to change this or I want to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m06s)

[change that and I'm I'm not overly happy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m08s)

[but I do things like I started off with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m10s)

[user secrets and I make sure that those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m12s)

[are set appropriately it has](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m18s)

[uh directory build props already set up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m19s)

[null ability already enabled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m22s)

[um if you want to turn on some of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m25s)

[compiler stuff I also tried to comment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m26s)

[out or comment a bunch of these as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m28s)

[if you need to do this underneath](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m30s)

[something else with another directory](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m33s)

[build props I left myself this was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m35s)

[partly so that I didn't have to look it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m37s)

[up every time I left myself the code for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m39s)

[how you do it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m42s)

[there's a build targets it's empty it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m43s)

[does use centralized package management](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m46s)

[um because this is one of the newer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m49s)

[nicer ways to manage your nuget packages](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m52s)

[it does have a nuget config set up with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m54s)

[all of the new nuget config options to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h25m57s)

[make sure that you have explicit package](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m00s)

[package sources so that if you need to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m02s)

[do things like be really explicit about](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m05s)

[where your packages are coming from to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m07s)

[avoid some sort of supply chain](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m09s)

[attack](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m12s)

[um like if you've got packages that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m14s)

[you're pulling in from a private feed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m17s)

[you want to make sure that you set up a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m18s)

[package source so that somebody else](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m20s)

[doesn't you know just start hosting that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m22s)

[package with the same name on nougat.org](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m24s)

[and accidentally you know bring in the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m27s)

[wrong package that would be bad right](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m28s)

[that's why they have these uh package](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m30s)

[sources set up why you should start with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m33s)

[a clear that way you know if somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m36s)

[hijacks a box and puts a nuget config at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m38s)

[the root it doesn't override yours yada](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m41s)

[yada so there's a bunch of again there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m43s)

[a ton of stuff in here and I keep](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m46s)

[telling myself I'm going to go and write](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m47s)

[good documentation on this I haven't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m48s)

[done it yet and I'm sorry](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m50s)

[um if you want to be able to do a.net](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m54s)

[publish and get a a standalone XE out I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h26m56s)

[left the property group that you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m01s)

[enable for it it is worth noting you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m02s)

[need to publish with release](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m05s)

[configuration which I believe is going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m07s)

[to be the default in.net 8 SDK](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m10s)

[but if you if you want to have that set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m14s)

[up and you're unsure how to do you know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m16s)

[single file executable for net publish](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m18s)

[all of that set up in here as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m21s)

[um all of this stuff is just kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m25s)

[built and ready to go so and then I also](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m26s)

[because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m30s)

[um the whole point like if you do mvvm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m33s)

[and you don't bother to unit test your](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m36s)

[view models you're missing out on a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m38s)

[of why the pattern exists with that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m41s)

[separation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m43s)

[right part of the reason we do the set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m44s)

[like part of why having everything in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m45s)

[the code behind was difficult was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m47s)

[because it was a pain to test everything](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m49s)

[was tightly coupled together](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m51s)

[well you Loosely coupled it so that you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m52s)

[could do things like test it so if you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m57s)

[so if you don't end up uh testing you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h27m58s)

[leaving a lot of that on there uh what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m01s)

[are you using for the mvvm stuff great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m03s)

[question so my uh and I've got hold on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m05s)

[Shameless self-promotion](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m08s)

[hang on Shameless self-promotion videos](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m12s)

[uh why is this not the right thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m17s)

[where's the search button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m20s)

[YouTube](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m24s)

[so the community toolkit mvvm is the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m27s)

[answer what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m30s)

[why is this not giving me my my search](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h28m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m03s)

[the 8.0 release it will cover most of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m04s)

[the basics and also teach uh basic mvvm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m07s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m11s)

[um their release notes will cover some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m12s)

[of the the newer things in 8.1](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m14s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m17s)

[yeah yeah if you're doing things with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m19s)

[reactive like reactive is good but you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m22s)

[are right you kind of have to switch](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m25s)

[your mindset a little bit in how you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m26s)

[approach things and they aren't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m28s)

[necessarily mutually exclusive either](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m30s)

[like there's been a number of times](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m32s)

[where I will still use](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m34s)

[some of the reactive components](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m37s)

[um but it it's it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m41s)

[you have to be intentional about when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m43s)

[you do it so but again if you pull in my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m46s)

[template that's the mvvm package I bring](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m49s)

[in because doing commands you get to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m54s)

[like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m55s)

[that's that's perfect right like that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m57s)

[what you want you want this kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h31m59s)

[thing for doing all of the The Source](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m01s)

[generators and your relay commands and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m04s)

[more importantly I I don't demo it here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m06s)

[but if you want to go async](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m09s)

[like say and we have to clear the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m11s)

[account and then we can count again and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m15s)

[it just it just works](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m17s)

[um but if you want async commands you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m20s)

[type in async task and proof you have an](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m22s)

[async thing the source generator is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m24s)

[smart enough to wrap that up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m26s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m27s)

[um and it is awesome there are a couple](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m29s)

[cool uh I will point this out if you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m33s)

[do async commands one of the ones that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m37s)

[always bites people is this allow](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m39s)

[concurrent executions so by default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m42s)

[um allow concurrent executions is false](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m46s)

[so that if somebody's monkey clicking uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m48s)

[a lot on your button it won't it won't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m51s)

[just fire your method over and over](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m54s)

[sometimes you want to allow concurrent](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m56s)

[executions so you got to come in here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m58s)

[and change this to true but it defaults](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h32m59s)

[to false that's the one I see bite](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m00s)

[people the most and unless you know to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m02s)

[go looking for that as an attribute on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m04s)

[the relay command attribute](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m06s)

[as a property on the relay command](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m09s)

[attribute some people get confused as to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m11s)

[how to handle it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m16s)

[yeah you'll see people leverage because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m18s)

[this library is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m20s)

[um just mvvm specific uh and not WP like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h33m23s)

[uh AI examples in this kind of thing as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h35m03s)

[well let me rephrase](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h35m38s)

[the closest content that you will](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h35m41s)

[probably see about WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h35m43s)

[stuff it doesn't really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m02s)

[yeah so the idea being they're they're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m07s)

[wanting to get people to move up and off](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m10s)

[of it and it's a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m12s)

[I have yet to try it against like my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m14s)

[setup here to see how it works](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m20s)

[yeah and I Maui Maui is definitely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m21s)

[supposed to be one of the WPF Killers](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m24s)

[specifically win UI three](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m27s)

[because that's the the Maui head for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m29s)

[desktop and I shouldn't call them heads](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m33s)

[pushing that direction](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m48s)

[but it's one of those I am I am waiting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m50s)

[to see adoption before I I jump ship](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m53s)

[because they've they again they've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m56s)

[threatened to kill WPF multiple times](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m57s)

[now and they've failed multiple times so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h36m59s)

[um for the Abalone UI but they did a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h37m58s)

[yeah this here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m02s)

[share this link as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m17s)

[they tagged me in this tweet and I I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m18s)

[nearly fell out of my thing laughing so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m20s)

[this is not a port and they they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m22s)

[commented down here a little bit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m24s)

[later](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m27s)

[um yeah it's it's xpf so it's yeah this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m29s)

[is not an avalonia Port uh they put the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m34s)

[actual library and did their](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m37s)

[cross-platform Abalone xpf stuff to run](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m40s)

[it so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m42s)

[yeah this was just them showing off that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m44s)

[hey look we can run your stuff right out](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m47s)

[of the box without having to work that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m49s)

[hard which](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m51s)

[points awarded that's pretty cool uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m53s)

[that is definitely cool](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h38m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m00s)

[uh let's see sorry I gotta catch up on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m03s)

[some stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m06s)

[uh yeah did the disappointment of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m07s)

[community because Microsoft made teams](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m10s)

[on react other than their technology](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m12s)

[yeah Microsoft though they do give their](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m13s)

[teams a lot of autonomy to pick their](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m16s)

[own Tech Stacks so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m18s)

[I I don't know how much](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m20s)

[there was design handed or how much the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m24s)

[team was independently picking it but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m27s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m31s)

[that's interesting that you did Blazer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m34s)

[on winforms the the Blazer hybrid uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m36s)

[uh that was my comedy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m42s)

[sorry uh the um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m44s)

[oh really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m49s)

[I I didn't make that connection](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m55s)

[sorry hold on gotta gotta catch up the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h39m59s)

[Blazer hybrid stuff is actually one of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m02s)

[the coolest bits of tech that I've seen](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m04s)

[in a while it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m06s)

[um the the company I work for was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m09s)

[evaluating](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m11s)

[um building a new app out and they were](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m13s)

[looking at different different Tech](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m15s)

[because they're like well there's going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m17s)

[to be this web component we think we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m18s)

[want like a mobile component and they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m20s)

[were going back and forth trying to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m22s)

[evaluate pros and cons of different](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m23s)

[solutions and I was like you know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m25s)

[laser hybrid's a thing and it's kind of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m28s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m31s)

[like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m34s)

[it is it is very very slick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m36s)

[so I but yeah so at least in terms of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m40s)

[WPF at build I think the closest you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m44s)

[probably going to see to WPF being](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m46s)

[referenced is maybe in a Maui talk where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m48s)

[they talk about upgrading off of it or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m50s)

[maybe something about like Upgrade](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m52s)

[Assistant where they talk about](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m54s)

[upgrading off of it I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m55s)

[I don't know this for a fact but that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m57s)

[would be my strong assumption](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h40m59s)

[but and again if if you have feedback on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m02s)

[app setup like this with the the generic](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m06s)

[host I am very happy to to hear feedback](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m09s)

[on it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m15s)

[yeah close to web native but still fun](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m15s)

[yeah and the other thing is some of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m18s)

[the Blazer hybrid stuff like in WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m21s)

[they're they'll do the Blazer hybrid but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m23s)

[it's using the the webview too](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m30s)

[uh no problem Justin Bieber uh the it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m31s)

[and the webview too you still run into](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m35s)

[the airspace issue in WPF so for people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m38s)

[not familiar with that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m40s)

[um in WPF you can embed uh Native](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m42s)

[controls directly into your UI](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m46s)

[um but because of the way WPF is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m49s)

[structured those elements end up being](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m51s)

[drawn on top of your window and not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m54s)

[actually part of your UI the the UI](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m56s)

[visual tree which means if you try to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h41m59s)

[put](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m02s)

[like a button over the top of a webview](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m02s)

[2 control like you put them both in the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m05s)

[middle of a grid the webview to control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m07s)

[because it's drawn on top of your window](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m09s)

[is always on top of your button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m11s)

[regardless of where you lay it out in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m13s)

[your visual tree which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m15s)

[the again the the common way you'll see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m17s)

[it reference is the WPF airspace issue](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m21s)

[and people have worked around it in a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m23s)

[number of ways they're all hacky but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m25s)

[that's one of the the big drawbacks with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m27s)

[like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m29s)

[any of the newer web stuff even though](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m31s)

[they did Blazer hybrid for WPF they did](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m34s)

[it but in order to make Blazer work you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m36s)

[need the newer web bits like you can't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m39s)

[use old web bits and expect Blazer to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m42s)

[work which meant web webview 2 but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m44s)

[webview 2 has airspace problems so it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m47s)

[like it's if you do go to do it that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m51s)

[the only word of caution I have just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m54s)

[make sure that wherever you want to draw](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m55s)

[your Blazer hybrid bits you don't ever](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h42m57s)

[intend to Overlay content on top of it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m00s)

[that'll also apply like if you it with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m02s)

[the material design Library if you do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m05s)

[like a drawer host](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m07s)

[the drawer host will also go behind it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m08s)

[we'll dialogue host be able to show on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m11s)

[top of it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m13s)

[yes the dialog host will show on top of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m14s)

[it if you use the default style because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m18s)

[the the default style for dialog host](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m21s)

[the dialogue is put in a pop-up which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m23s)

[a separate window](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m26s)

[so you jump and that separate window in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m27s)

[the dialog host is both a blessing and a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m31s)

[curse it causes a lot of bugs for people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m33s)

[but because the dialogue is in a pop-up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m34s)

[it will sit on top of it if you use the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m38s)

[embedded dialog host style it will not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m40s)

[because that's inside your visual tree](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m44s)

[completely so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m45s)

[so yes ish depends uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m48s)

[yeah the way I did hybrid was more where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m55s)

[there's just a bare minimum for the host](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m58s)

[window and the rest is done in Blazer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h43m59s)

[that's actually a really great way to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m01s)

[it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m05s)

[to be able to to dive to dive down and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m06s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m08s)

[um because if you do everything in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m10s)

[Blazer you don't the the airspace issue](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m11s)

[in like WPF doesn't matter anymore it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m14s)

[just goes away because you don't have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m17s)

[any WPF content on top of your Blazer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m20s)

[content](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m23s)

[yeah blazer because that was the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m27s)

[template I started from yeah and it at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m29s)

[present I don't think they've released](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m31s)

[any templates that are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m33s)

[the the Blazer hybrid templates aren't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m37s)

[very good in my opinion like which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m41s)

[why I started spinning my own templates](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m44s)

[because I was unhappy with them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m45s)

[it's like this has to be better this has](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m47s)

[to be better](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m53s)

[if you've heard of funyuno.net](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m56s)

[uh much more lightweight than electron](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h44m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m04s)

[I have not but now I have to punch that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m05s)

[into the Googles](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m08s)

[I assume](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m10s)

[this is the project you're referencing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m12s)

[updated recently small number of commits](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m17s)

[how many releases do they have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m23s)

[just the one or is that just latest](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m29s)

[oh quite a few or at least several](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m39s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m41s)

[webkit based browser controls](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h45m47s)

[continuation Stephen Sanders webview](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m02s)

[experiment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m04s)

[I am I am familiar with Steven Sanderson](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m08s)

[uh yes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m13s)

[no I have not seen this this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m16s)

[this is interesting my only thought here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m19s)

[would be wondering if this is still](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m21s)

[experiment level or if this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m24s)

[rock and roll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m30s)

[build native cross-platform apps](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m36s)

[I mean this looks pretty good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m39s)

[wow this might be worth uh taking a run](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m44s)

[at at some point](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m47s)

[web UI native yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h46m52s)

[and of course they blazered all the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m00s)

[things too that's the I feel like as](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m02s)

[much as uh Microsoft wants to AI all the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m04s)

[things all the web people at Microsoft](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m07s)

[want to Blazer all the things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m10s)

[wow that is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m14s)

[that is a significant drop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m18s)

[there has been a huge push in dot net to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m22s)

[gets a lot smaller and a lot faster](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m27s)

[because especially in the olden days.net](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m29s)

[was this big heavy clunky thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m32s)

[that's not nearly as as bad as it is now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m35s)

[um because especially the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m41s)

[um the aot compilation and the trimming](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m45s)

[um actually can get you down quite small](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m50s)

[and quite fast](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m53s)

[there are just a bunch of limitations](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m54s)

[with what you can do with ahead of time](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h47m57s)

[compilation because if you do aot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m00s)

[compilation and net](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m02s)

[you have to give up the the jit so there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m04s)

[you don't have that just in time](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m07s)

[compiler anymore because by definition](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m09s)

[you're using an ahead of time](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m11s)

[compilation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m13s)

[um and so there are some features that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m15s)

[you can't do with like reflection emit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m17s)

[to be able to build things at runtime](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m22s)

[because you just don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m24s)

[like there is no jit there like it's not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m26s)

[you can't do that so but other than that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m29s)

[you can do some pretty cool stuff I've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m32s)

[also heard that like with the trimming](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m34s)

[feature turned on you can get your](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m36s)

[binaries really small](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m38s)

[but things that rely on reflection often](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m40s)

[will fail because the the trimmer is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m43s)

[fairly aggressive](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m46s)

[and unless you have a library that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m48s)

[intentionally gone through and marked](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m50s)

[stuff so that the trimmer knows hey this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m51s)

[is reflection invoke don't just drop it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m54s)

[when it does its tree shaking it it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m56s)

[tries to cut the whole tree WPF is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h48m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m02s)

[actually flagged in their documentation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m03s)

[um because if you go and look up like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m06s)

[the self-contained or published ones](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m08s)

[there are other switches in here for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m10s)

[turning on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m14s)

[trimming you do not want to turn it on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m15s)

[for WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m18s)

[the base WPF libraries were never](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m20s)

[designed with trimming in mind it will](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m23s)

[fail I promise it will I got really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m25s)

[excited one day because I thought I had](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m28s)

[it working I was like really and then I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m30s)

[tried to do anything of consequence and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m32s)

[it fell over so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m34s)

[you might get an app to compile and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m36s)

[launch beyond that you're you're taking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m39s)

[it in your own hands](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m42s)

[um is fully trim compatible yeah and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m46s)

[that's one of the other things with the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m49s)

[a lot of the newer Frameworks is they're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m51s)

[trying to make sure that newer libraries](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m53s)

[have things like trimming enabled so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m55s)

[that they can take advantage of it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h49m58s)

[yeah and that that it you're absolutely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m03s)

[correct that is one of the reasons for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m05s)

[Source generators is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m07s)

[because now you can become uh trim and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m10s)

[aot friendly if you're doing things that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m13s)

[compile time rather than at runtime so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m16s)

[effectively](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m18s)

[lower once you once you eliminate the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m20s)

[need for the jit you can go really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m22s)

[bloody fast](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m24s)

[so they they keep showing different](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m26s)

[benchmarks where because people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m28s)

[oftentimes compare them to things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m30s)

[go where go if you do a Hello world is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m31s)

[really tiny and so like the asp.net core](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m34s)

[team they're like well okay we've got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m36s)

[kind of apples and oranges comparisons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m38s)

[because they're people will compare](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m40s)

[their default.net new template to like a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m42s)

[default template from like like some go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m45s)

[or rust language and they're like okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m48s)

[guys you gotta understand their default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m50s)

[template is Hello World our default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m52s)

[template has auth like those are not the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m54s)

[same feature set you gotta compare](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h50m58s)

[apples to apples if you're if you're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m01s)

[doing things like that to look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m03s)

[uh okay I got horribly distracted](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m05s)

[which is fine we like distractions](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m09s)

[um okay so I think we're gonna fire this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m12s)

[up and then and I as long as this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m14s)

[still working I think I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m16s)

[comment on this PR](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m18s)

[and we can probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m21s)

[call that good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m23s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m28s)

[but now I also I I'm I'm really curious](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m29s)

[to go and look at that 8.2 release of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m32s)

[the community toolkit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m35s)

[because I have to see what goodness they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m36s)

[put in there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m38s)

[were some features that I saw after 8.1](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m40s)

[that were being worked on with some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m42s)

[additional analyzers and whatnot that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m43s)

[got me really excited I'm like um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m45s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m46s)

[give me more goodness give me more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m48s)

[goodness](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m50s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m51s)

[that's right we were I think we were](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m55s)

[dealing with the 40 yeah we were dealing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h51m57s)

[with the issue of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m00s)

[text change not triggering](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m02s)

[or not posting back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m05s)

[which is where we were going to come](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m07s)

[into here and deal with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m11s)

[so it was going to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m12s)

[text box field uh text changed I it was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m15s)

[doing it on Lost focus and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m19s)

[decide if lost focus is the right place](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m21s)

[to do it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m25s)

[uh yeah numeric up down like the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m28s)

[extended WP toolkit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m30s)

[uh I'm the one who asked for it in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m31s)

[Discord by the way ah perfect so you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m33s)

[probably saw the the follow-up chat from](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m36s)

[uh what was it uh Noob c-sharp](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m40s)

[programmer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m42s)

[um he's the one who opened a PR](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m44s)

[which is what we're poking at it's one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m46s)

[of those I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m49s)

[normally I've pushed back on adding a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m50s)

[bunch of of controls especially controls](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m53s)

[that don't normally exist in WPF and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m55s)

[don't exist in like the the default](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h52m58s)

[material design spec but there's a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m00s)

[handful of things that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m02s)

[if they get asked for enough](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m05s)

[they're probably worthwhile adding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m11s)

[just by nature of people wanting things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m12s)

[so it's like okay we'll we'll put stuff](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m16s)

[in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m18s)

[we'll put stuff in when needed uh let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m19s)

[see here so we want to go here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m23s)

[we want to go here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m25s)

[and I actually you know what I think the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m29s)

[Lost focus is probably better let's just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m31s)

[let's just put that code back real quick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m34s)

[because if I go down here I can do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m38s)

[and I can go discard selection I can go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m41s)

[discard selection](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m44s)

[um we're gonna leave the culture change](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m47s)

[and I want something like this discard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m49s)

[selection boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m52s)

[uh yeah give me that thanks](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m54s)

[you've been wonderful uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m57s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h53m59s)

[okay so we don't need any of this we](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m00s)

[don't need any of this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m02s)

[this really just needs to come down to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m04s)

[we don't want this bit here so we want](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m08s)

[to do a uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m12s)

[if text box field](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m16s)

[text and we want to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m19s)

[intry parse and we want to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m22s)

[cultureinfo dot current UI culture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m26s)

[because we want to be culture where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m28s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m31s)

[where is the oh format provider goes to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m32s)

[last that's right](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m35s)

[you go here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m38s)

[uh let's see you can just copy and paste](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m41s)

[from my apps yeah so and that's the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m44s)

[thing is we do have the compatibility](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m46s)

[library with ma apps that has something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m48s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m53s)

[you make a good point I should probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m54s)

[go look at what Juan has done and see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h54m56s)

[um what is there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m01s)

[uh let's see and I think I want to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m05s)

[number styles](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m08s)

[uh what what does integer give me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m11s)

[because integer is a composite one isn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m16s)

[seven so it's going to give me leading](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m17s)

[white trailing white leading sign](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m20s)

[I think that's all I want](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m23s)

[could do number and pick up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m28s)

[but these are decimal point parentheses](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m31s)

[Trail nah we don't need all that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m35s)

[integer will be fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m37s)

[uh yeah you do need number Styles when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m39s)

[using culture you are absolutely correct](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m42s)

[uh let's see how it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m44s)

[uh numeric value call that good and then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m48s)

[we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m53s)

[we're gonna go Set current value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h55m56s)

[uh value property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m01s)

[and we want numeric value to go in there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m05s)

[and we don't do any of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m07s)

[range checking because we're leaving](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m10s)

[that to the uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m12s)

[uh course will only support it at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m15s)

[present yes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m18s)

[though I'd be curious to know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m19s)

[use case for it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m26s)

[uh I've learned in numeric up down is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m28s)

[based on decimal interesting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m30s)

[do they also have an option on their](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m32s)

[numeric up down for the increment amount](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m35s)

[then I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m37s)

[because as you can see because right now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m40s)

[you can see the increment here is hard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m41s)

[coded at one and negative one and I I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m43s)

[kind of feel like if you go to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m46s)

[effort of allowing uh decimal or any](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m48s)

[fractional bit you almost have to have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m52s)

[that increment value](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m54s)

[increment amount is configurable okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h56m58s)

[kind of makes sense I'm I'd be curious](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m01s)

[to know how often people use that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m03s)

[yeah at present this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m09s)

[uh it's a draft PR at the moment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m14s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m18s)

[I don't think it's going to merge right](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m20s)

[away but I do plan on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m22s)

[uh trying to put it into the four nine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m27s)

[release](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m29s)

[it probably just needs a little bit of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m33s)

[love though](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m34s)

[I thought I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m36s)

[there and now if I type 42](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m38s)

[43 there we go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m41s)

[okay that makes me feel a little better](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m44s)

[the width is still making me feel](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m46s)

[I never lowered that did I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m49s)

[don't think I played with it in Snoop uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m52s)

[let's change because the minimum width](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m55s)

[should should be as Tiny as absolutely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h57m58s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m01s)

[and then people can override it as they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m03s)

[see fit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m05s)

[Min widths let's do 110](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m07s)

[or tiny is that we can even go smaller](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m11s)

[but honored](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m15s)

[yeah let's go let's go down to there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m18s)

[that's probably a reasonable one and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m20s)

[what we're setting it in the style so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m21s)

[somebody can override it if they don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m23s)

[like it but at least then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m24s)

[it doesn't completely shrink down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m27s)

[I think integer is 99 fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m30s)

[uh is it a breaking change if you start](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m36s)

[with it later and change it to decimal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m42s)

[yes specifically](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m45s)

[specifically because the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m52s)

[the Min Maxes are going to be different](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m54s)

[and the types are going to be different](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m56s)

[though](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h58m57s)

[so there's a philosophical debate about](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m00s)

[um the breaking change binary or source](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m04s)

[code compatibility because in a lot of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m07s)

[cases you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m09s)

[like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m13s)

[I am okay making breaking changes when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m14s)

[the impact is probably not that high and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m16s)

[for most people if we were to switch](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m19s)

[from int to decimal later on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m22s)

[even though it would be a breaking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m24s)

[change the impact of that breaking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m26s)

[change would probably be low](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m28s)

[because for most people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m31s)

[the conversion would just happen and it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m34s)

[wouldn't matter](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m36s)

[and so it's it it would probably just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m39s)

[work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m42s)

[so there'd be a little bit of that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m43s)

[um the other thing that I wouldn't mind](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m46s)

[doing as well is given that this thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m47s)

[is called numeric up down I wouldn't I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m51s)

[wouldn't actually be opposed to having a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m54s)

[um a separate control for the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=01h59m59s)

[for the the decimal case because I do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m01s)

[think that in most cases it would work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m04s)

[oh that was the other thing I was going](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m08s)

[to change is it was wiring up for Mouse](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m10s)

[wheel even when the mouse wheel was over](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m12s)

[the buttons and I don't think that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m14s)

[because that's the other thing and I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m17s)

[curious and feedback of what people](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m19s)

[think do you want because right now the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m21s)

[the way you can change this is you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m25s)

[type in here you can click the buttons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m26s)

[the arrow keys work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m29s)

[we're up and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m31s)

[and mouse wheel also goes up and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m33s)

[and I'm a little on the fence on the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m38s)

[mouse wheel case if that's a desirable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m39s)

[feature or not the biggest thing that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m41s)

[gets me is when you have like you'll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m43s)

[note if I do my mouse wheel over here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m46s)

[I can scroll up and down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m48s)

[but it means if you have this thing in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m51s)

[any sort of scroll viewer it's going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m53s)

[capture that scroll event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m56s)

[and you're going to stop scrolling and I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h00m58s)

[always get annoyed when I'm using forms](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m00s)

[and I start scrolling down and just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m02s)

[because my cursor gets over](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m05s)

[it then starts doing it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m07s)

[the mouse is optional under the property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m10s)

[maybe even only on Focus okay I think I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m15s)

[like that of limited to focus that way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m18s)

[if you scroll past it it doesn't uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m21s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m23s)

[yeah I agree Mouse wheel was one of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m27s)

[ones I was I was very much on the fence](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m29s)

[on of whether it should be there I do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m31s)

[like the idea of adding a a focus check](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m33s)

[for it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m40s)

[we should probably do something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m46s)

[about like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m51s)

[right of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m53s)

[limit it that way](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h01m56s)

[because I do like that idea of don't let](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m00s)

[it don't let it just blindly always go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m02s)

[because key events are implicitly tied](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m07s)

[to keyboard Focus because that's where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m10s)

[they're going to route to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m12s)

[yeah okay so let's let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m16s)

[some of these changes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m18s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m21s)

[I'm wondering if I should](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m28s)

[okay that change is worthless discard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m31s)

[um okay so let's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m36s)

[do I push these changes straight to the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m38s)

[branch or not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m42s)

[somewhat tempted to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m50s)

[yeah I'm somewhat tempted to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h02m59s)

[I'm just looking to see if there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m04s)

[anything in here that's going to be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m06s)

[overly confusing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m07s)

[that goes there that goes there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m10s)

[that goes there that goes there that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m14s)

[goes there okay perfect I I think we're](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m16s)

[gonna go with this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m19s)

[um so I'm working](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m20s)

[uh changes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m23s)

[two nights](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m28s)

[live stream and here we find out if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m31s)

[uh if we kill it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m35s)

[yeah I agree that I think I I like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m37s)

[too Justin Bieber of have a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m41s)

[have a toggle for it to be on or off oh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m46s)

[good yay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m50s)

[okay I love it when people leave the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m52s)

[checkbox check to allow me to push back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m54s)

[to the branch thank you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m56s)

[appreciate that okay so let's go and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h03m58s)

[leave some feedback on there I've lost](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m00s)

[all my pull requests](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m03s)

[okay pull request so uh refresh we got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m05s)

[some stuff going on I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m09s)

[ignore the demo app because don't care](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m10s)

[okay so feedback on here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m13s)

[let's we'll start while I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m17s)

[about it we'll start with the mouse](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m19s)

[wheel](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m21s)

[uh let's see might be nice to create](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m23s)

[another dependency](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m27s)

[proper t uh T2](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m30s)

[disable this Behavior](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m34s)

[uh for those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m38s)

[you don't want it okay so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m41s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m46s)

[let's see let's see we'll do I think I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m48s)

[can I'll just catch them all right here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m54s)

[four commands we should create new uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h04m55s)

[dependency](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m02s)

[uh properties for the command uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m04s)

[parameters](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m11s)

[this should be similar to how the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m11s)

[button works](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m18s)

[see it goes there goes there goes there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m22s)

[it's there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m26s)

[oh I undid my changes and I forgot to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m28s)

[hang on I'm gonna clean those up real](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m30s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m32s)

[so we don't need the null forgiveness](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m35s)

[operator there there or there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m38s)

[those are all not needed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m41s)

[a question by default should the mouse](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m44s)

[will work or be disabled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m46s)

[my gut reaction says disabled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m50s)

[but I I am open to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h05m56s)

[feedback](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m00s)

[like I'm leaning slightly more towards](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m04s)

[the disabled side but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m06s)

[I'm at like a 60 40.](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m10s)

[I I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m13s)

[if it matters](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m17s)

[much to me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m19s)

[okay was there anything else in here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m22s)

[that I wanted to oh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m24s)

[clean up the the using](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m26s)

[I think that was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m30s)

[it for here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m32s)

[I think that handles all of those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m35s)

[handles all of these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m37s)

[I think that is there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m50s)

[I think this is fine I think this is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m54s)

[fine there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h06m56s)

[that's fine there in the generic one so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m00s)

[we'll mark that as good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m07s)

[I'm not sure if we want this border or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m09s)

[not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m12s)

[I'm a little torn like on one hand it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m14s)

[nice but I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m17s)

[like the control itself has things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m22s)

[border brush and Border thickness so if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m25s)

[you omit this border you're taking away](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m27s)

[and somebody sets the the Border brush](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m30s)

[property they then just file a bug and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m32s)

[say](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m34s)

[why doesn't the Border brush property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m35s)

[work it's like well because the template](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m37s)

[didn't use it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m38s)

[but it's also not something I see being](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m42s)

[used a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m46s)

[you generally don't want to increase](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m48s)

[your visual tree if you don't have to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m51s)

[that's one of the WPF performance things](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m55s)

[is if you have very deeply nested visual](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h07m57s)

[trees and I will admit some of the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m00s)

[material design templates](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m02s)

[have they add a lot of stuff to your](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m04s)

[visual tree and I'm sorry](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m06s)

[that I I keep toying with ideas of how](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m08s)

[to kind of tease things apart without](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m11s)

[making my life miserable for maintenance](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m17s)

[because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m18s)

[you don't know what feature somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m19s)

[might turn on and so you have to have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m21s)

[all the things there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m23s)

[I guess it's fine it's one border](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m25s)

[control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m26s)

[you know go back and forth we'll see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m28s)

[um I think in here though I cleaned up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m32s)

[everything that was not needed I do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m34s)

[think a separate](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m37s)

[at least one more template I would](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m40s)

[probably create](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m42s)

[because I suspect at least personally I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m44s)

[want the one with the Stacked buttons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m47s)

[rather than the side by side](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m48s)

[I think that's probably more likely my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m51s)

[my go-to and then I think the only other](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m54s)

[thing I would probably do is write some](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m57s)

[UI tests over this as well](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h08m59s)

[um that's fine](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m03s)

[uh let's see and I think uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m06s)

[would be nice to put in a few more](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m10s)

[examples showing the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m15s)

[commands Min and Max](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m18s)

[see is there anything else on there that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m23s)

[was useful](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m25s)

[uh I think it would look better if the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m27s)

[buttons were both on the right side](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m29s)

[maybe as half button stacked on top of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m30s)

[each other currently does not look like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m32s)

[one control I yeah I can agree with that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m34s)

[like I said I think for me personally I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m38s)

[like the Stacked look of those buttons](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m40s)

[and I would probably do the thing where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m43s)

[you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m45s)

[um you round the top two corners on the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m46s)

[top button in the bottom two corners](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m48s)

[that way it looks like a single pill](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m50s)

[shaped because I've done that a bunch](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m52s)

[with the material design buttons where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m54s)

[I'll stack them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m56s)

[I'll literally just put two buttons next](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m57s)

[to each other but because of how you set](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h09m59s)

[up the border and clip the shadow it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m01s)

[ends up giving you that kind of uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m04s)

[what do they call it split button I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m06s)

[don't know if that's the right word](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m09s)

[type feel to it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m10s)

[one the one uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m12s)

[uh I don't know what that one looks like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m19s)

[yeah so the the decimal with the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m27s)

[steps is definitely doable the question](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m29s)

[is do we want to bite that off or not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m33s)

[numeric up downfield what do you look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m37s)

[like picture picture](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m39s)

[yeah something like this definitely is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m43s)

[this is actually a nice Style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m50s)

[this This lends itself well to the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m53s)

[same way that the text Fields look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h10m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m01s)

[fields](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m02s)

[because we've got something similar with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m05s)

[those are password boxes but we've got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m09s)

[uh uh let's see the reveal password](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m11s)

[boxes why do I not oh yeah where you've](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m13s)

[got the the text box with the backing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m17s)

[field and the underlying control and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m19s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m20s)

[because then you can because then you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m24s)

[can Pro we can forward in things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m26s)

[the floating hint and that sort of thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m28s)

[because right now the floating hint](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m30s)

[isn't actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m32s)

[making it in and it might be nice to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m34s)

[wire those up that's another good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m36s)

[comment](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m38s)

[um I might actually steal this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m42s)

[any other styles](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m47s)

[we'll do this and so do that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m58s)

[let's go back down to the xaml](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h11m59s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m03s)

[we'll go here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m06s)

[one idea for a cleaner look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m08s)

[uh could be to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m13s)

[match the look of the one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m16s)

[whoa](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m26s)

[hyperlink all this oh take the Habit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m28s)

[dang dammit I can't type no no no no no](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m30s)

[no no no](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m33s)

[there there there there okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m35s)

[uh let's see also make sure you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m40s)

[align the number horizontally](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m42s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m44s)

[that is a good point thank you uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m50s)

[uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h12m57s)

[three Pro](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m00s)

[ugly want to consider forwarding the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m08s)

[and lion](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m12s)

[uh on the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m16s)

[right here so effectively](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m19s)

[um this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m32s)

[and default the the value to centered in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m34s)

[the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m50s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m54s)

[uh also want to forward the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h13m57s)

[text box uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m02s)

[uh in properties uh let's see here I can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m06s)

[probably get a good link for those](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m10s)

[because I don't remember what the full](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m13s)

[set is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m17s)

[let's see but I think if I go and look](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m21s)

[at the default text box style it has](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m23s)

[them all at the top of the style](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m27s)

[let's just search hint](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m32s)

[no no no just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m39s)

[this thing doesn't show it maybe I'll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m47s)

[grab it off the demo app then](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m51s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m54s)

[just worry that somebody's gonna think](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m58s)

[that that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h14m59s)

[what I'm suggesting and it's forwarding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m01s)

[them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m04s)

[oh I keep wanting to look at text boxes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m06s)

[but it's under fields](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m09s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m12s)

[okay show me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m13s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m17s)

[floating hint](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m23s)

[uh I'll just grab these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m27s)

[uh see back to here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m32s)

[and down to here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m36s)

[uh these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m41s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m47s)

[hatched](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m51s)

[let me use that uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m52s)

[into the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h15m57s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m00s)

[that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m02s)

[is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m05s)

[consumers can change them](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m07s)

[boom something like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m10s)

[I will say though for for somebody's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m17s)

[first rev at doing a custom control in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m19s)

[WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m22s)

[this is not that bad](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m23s)

[this is this is fairly good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m25s)

[I I have I've definitely seen a lot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m30s)

[worse](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m33s)

[still that that hard-coded corner radius](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m39s)

[is making me twitch but I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m42s)

[again I just question if we should drop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m45s)

[the entire border control or not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m50s)

[uh it's like what's more likely somebody](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m53s)

[to use the property being a happy it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m55s)

[not functional](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h16m58s)

[I mean they can always wrap it in a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m01s)

[border](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m03s)

[but then they're arbitrarily making](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m05s)

[their nesting larger because I didn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m07s)

[Implement a property](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m08s)

[API is hard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m11s)

[API is hard](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m14s)

[okay I think we're gonna go like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m20s)

[for now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m22s)

[um let's see uh one other thing that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m25s)

[would be good to do is write some UI](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m30s)

[tests for this control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m36s)

[you need any help setting that up uh let](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m40s)

[me know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m47s)

[we'll do that uh because I I'm fully](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m49s)

[aware I tell people to write UI tests](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m52s)

[but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m54s)

[like oftentimes if if somebody struggles](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m55s)

[with the UI test I am very happy to go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h17m58s)

[and write the test for you because I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m00s)

[realize this UI testing library is my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m03s)

[library and I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m05s)

[I just even though I think it's easy to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m08s)

[use I don't know that it's easy for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m11s)

[people to use](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m13s)

[foreign but like this doesn't seem](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m15s)

[terribly difficult](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m19s)

[it's pretty easy slapping your control](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m23s)

[pull the stuff out and Away you go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m26s)

[and it does all the things but at least](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m29s)

[this way you can have some some nice](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m32s)

[assurity like those tests I was doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m34s)

[where I you know double click on the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m36s)

[text box to select the text I type in a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m38s)

[value then I click the plus button and I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m41s)

[expect the value to increment by one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m43s)

[more than whatever I typed in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m44s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m46s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m49s)

[not great for large damage yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m52s)

[so but I do like it I have I was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m54s)

[contemplating looking at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m57s)

[doing something else or or giving myself](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h18m59s)

[a slightly different interface into to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m04s)

[to doing this testing because I know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m06s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m08s)

[um there's various work happening around](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m10s)

[trying to figure out how to test other](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m12s)

[apps that aren't web](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m14s)

[like web UI tests like web developers](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m16s)

[are spoiled for Choice when it comes to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m20s)

[UI testing Frameworks they have not only](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m22s)

[good choices they have multiple good](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m26s)

[choices which is shocking](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m31s)

[and thick client apps we just don't have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m32s)

[much like there's not much for Maui](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m36s)

[there's there's not much for WPF and so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m38s)

[especially if you want to do something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m42s)

[lower level because most of the desktop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m44s)

[ones go through the accessibility apis](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m47s)

[which are great for simulating user](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m50s)

[input they are horrible for doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m52s)

[assertions on your UI tree](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m55s)

[absolutely horrible](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m57s)

[because they want you to to only look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h19m59s)

[um individual bits uh have you tried](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m04s)

[verified xaml uh I have not but I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m07s)

[believe that was one that I looked at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m10s)

[pull up and confirm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m14s)

[because this is yeah this is Simon crops](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m17s)

[one](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m20s)

[yeah because this is leveraging Snapshot](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m23s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m26s)

[um to be able to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m27s)

[which is which is great](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m33s)

[but it's not quite](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m36s)

[I'm trying to remember where the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m40s)

[this is basic one where is the xamely](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m44s)

[bits](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m47s)

[because snapshot testing is a very nice](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m49s)

[way of doing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m56s)

[verification of xaml uis](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h20m58s)

[uh there this guy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m01s)

[being rendered as a verified xaml yeah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m13s)

[so you set up your your xaml bit and go](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m16s)

[through and do it the the disadvantage](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m18s)

[here is this doesn't have like an](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m21s)

[interaction model to it I think is what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m23s)

[I is what I came to the conclusion of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m25s)

[that it does because I want to be able](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m29s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m32s)

[um like for example](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m35s)

[like the dialogue host is a is a better](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m37s)

[one of I want to be able to do something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m40s)

[like this where I pop in the controls I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m42s)

[do some clicks I validate the text I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m45s)

[click on some other stuff and go back](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m48s)

[and forth and that's where things start](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m50s)

[to get a little more challenging because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m52s)

[the way this actually ends up working](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m54s)

[under the hood you'll know this isn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m56s)

[using the X unit like SDA fact for being](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h21m58s)

[able to create UI elements this doesn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m01s)

[run on a UI thread](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m04s)

[what it does instead is it spins a full](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m07s)

[WPF app shell and then injects content](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m09s)

[into that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m15s)

[it so it's actually the full rendering](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m16s)

[Pipeline and all of that jazz which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m19s)

[both a blessing and a curse this works](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m22s)

[well for certain things I don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m24s)

[I don't know how well I like the the big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m28s)

[Advantage with snapshot testing is when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m32s)

[people have uh like these full snapshots](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m35s)

[or oracles built up you get really knife](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m39s)

[and stiffs when you when there's changes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m42s)

[that that comes in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m47s)

[like we use Snapshot testing a lot when](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m48s)

[we're like producing nuget packages and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m51s)

[the public API matters because there's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m53s)

[lots of libraries out there that will](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m55s)

[rip through an assembly and give you a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m57s)

[stream representation of your API](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h22m59s)

[and then it means when anybody makes a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m02s)

[change that change that modifies that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m04s)

[public API you actually see that show up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m07s)

[in the diff which is great that's what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m10s)

[you want you want to know it like if](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m12s)

[you're producing something for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m14s)

[developers to consume how that the shape](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m16s)

[of your public API is kind of a big deal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m18s)

[but the snapshot testing is awesome for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m21s)

[things like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m24s)

[um I know some of Simon crop stuff he's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m25s)

[done a lot where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m29s)

[um it's like full object snapshots so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m31s)

[even like in memory objects because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m34s)

[ultimately he uh he's looking to get](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m36s)

[that same sort of assertion syntax where](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m38s)

[it's you know I've got object a object B](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m41s)

[show me the diffs right like that that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m43s)

[been a problem people always fight with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m46s)

[when you've got a deep object model and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m48s)

[you're like are these two things equal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m49s)

[yuck that assertion is ugly and how you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m52s)

[show when they aren't equal is really](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m55s)

[hard but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m57s)

[um like his verified test Library does](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h23m59s)

[the same thing a lot of like approval](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m02s)

[test does the same thing they'll pop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m04s)

[your default diff viewer with like a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m05s)

[Json representation of the objects and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m07s)

[then it becomes really obvious where the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m09s)

[diffs are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m12s)

[um I wonder why there is no headless WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m14s)

[I think largely because WPF was written](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m16s)

[before that kind of thing was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m19s)

[popular](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m22s)

[and that that's part of why like you can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m24s)

[kind of do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m27s)

[you can kind of do headless WPF](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m29s)

[um and I think we do it in our](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m32s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m35s)

[so you can kind of do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m39s)

[headless type testing but anything that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m42s)

[acts on the the UI bit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m46s)

[um has to be on an sta thread but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m50s)

[conveniently you know X units extendable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m53s)

[it's easy to do that you just sta fact](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m56s)

[and you have to make sure you're using](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h24m58s)

[the STA fact nuget package but not a big](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m00s)

[deal the biggest drawback when you run](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m02s)

[in this type of mode is you run into](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m05s)

[situations where you now have to do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m07s)

[kind of type setup is you have to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m10s)

[instantiate your control you have to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m12s)

[apply the style you have to basically](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m14s)

[make sure that you've done the same sort](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m16s)

[of arrange layout render pass that the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m18s)

[WPF framework would have done for you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m22s)

[which is why like we had started writing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m24s)

[tests like this and I haven't deleted](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m28s)

[them because they provide value but at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m29s)

[the same time they also](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m32s)

[they](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m36s)

[there's no guarantee that what I do here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m38s)

[matches what the framework's going to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m40s)

[and so these became really brittle](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m43s)

[because the there was always bugs that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m45s)

[would creep in when it's like oh well in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m47s)

[order to you know make this work you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m50s)

[have to manually raise the loaded event](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m52s)

[after you've done the style and also you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m54s)

[have to make sure that a measure pass](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m58s)

[and a layout pass has occur and it just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h25m59s)

[got obnoxious which is why I for my xaml](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m01s)

[test Library I spin the shell and just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m04s)

[load content into it because then I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m06s)

[legitimately in a full WPF app](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m08s)

[I get the full rendering pipeline of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m11s)

[whatever that system's gonna do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m13s)

[which can sometimes be obnoxious but it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m15s)

[actually works on a pipeline too which](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m18s)

[is kind of fun](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m20s)

[so that that was my motivation is there](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m22s)

[was no good library that I found that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m25s)

[let you do component level testing and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m27s)

[access to things on the visual tree](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m31s)

[with interaction like that's that was](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m33s)

[what I wanted I wanted to be able to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m36s)

[test that individual component interact](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m39s)

[with it and then validate things out of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m41s)

[the visual tree not just things with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m44s)

[accessibility stuff on it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m46s)

[because I always like being able to see](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m51s)

[things like oh did the validation pop](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m54s)

[and you know did the text turn red or](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m56s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h26m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m00s)

[would be great if verified xaml and xaml](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m00s)

[tests could be used together you know](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m03s)

[that's a good point they shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m05s)

[necessarily mutually exclusive](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m07s)

[um I don't know if verify xaml is what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m10s)

[you would want to use](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m12s)

[um but you certainly should be able to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m14s)

[use](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m20s)

[any sort of approval based testing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m20s)

[because the the fundamental part of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m23s)

[approval-based testing is being able to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m25s)

[get down to a string representation of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m29s)

[whatever the thing is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m31s)

[I don't know how that would be to do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m34s)

[it's probably it's probably not that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m40s)

[difficult actually](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m43s)

[because you'd effectively just need to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m50s)

[make sure that you call](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m51s)

[point](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m57s)

[I think the key thing for xaml test is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h27m58s)

[this would need to be invoked in my](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m01s)

[um the sh my WPF app shell](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m05s)

[but I already support things like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m11s)

[callbacks and whatnot from the shell](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m13s)

[back into the test project so it would](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m15s)

[not be difficult to do you obviously](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m18s)

[couldn't do it as a module initializer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m21s)

[but it it knows when the app is starting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m22s)

[and having that as a callback would not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m27s)

[be difficult I I am noticing that this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m29s)

[thing is like I see things like AV](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m32s)

[button](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m34s)

[yeah this I I suspect from looking at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m38s)

[this this is the text representation of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m42s)

[the bammal not the originals not the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m46s)

[xaml itself because when WPF gets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m48s)

[compiled under the hood if you go and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m51s)

[pop open the assembly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m53s)

[you'll see in the well hang on I can](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m56s)

[just I can tell you or I could just show](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h28m58s)

[you](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m02s)

[Ian spy come here](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m03s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m05s)

[the Inspire was giving me a crap earlier](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m07s)

[so we'll see if it actually launches](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m09s)

[Ben debug](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m12s)

[did you crash the end spy I can't tell](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m15s)

[I need to go and reset it it's loading](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m21s)

[it's thinking it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m24s)

[doing something](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m25s)

[okay so close you okay so if we go and](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m27s)

[look at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m31s)

[uh let's see so this is demo the the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m33s)

[entry of steam bits in the WPF app are](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m37s)

[in the dll not the XE](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m39s)

[but if you open this guy up](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m42s)

[is it resources](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m45s)

[yeah so you'll know what actually gets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m47s)

[compiled under the hood is these bammal](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m49s)

[resources not the actual xaml and dnspy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m52s)

[does a nice little thing where it tries](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m56s)

[to show](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h29m59s)

[a reasonable representation of it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m00s)

[but it's worth noting that these are not](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m04s)

[exactly the same in a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m06s)

[you'll find that the bammal is expanded](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m08s)

[out and this is actually effectively a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m10s)

[binary representation of what the xaml](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m13s)

[was so that WPF could load quickly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m17s)

[so the xaml gets](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m21s)

[compiled](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m24s)

[it's not really compiled converted feels](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m26s)

[like a better answer but I I suspect](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m30s)

[What's Happening Here is it's reading](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m32s)

[the Bama files](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m34s)

[and do loading them into like an X](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m37s)

[document and then formatting it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m39s)

[appropriately I'm I'm guessing that's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m41s)

[the intent or how it's working under the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m43s)

[hood](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m46s)

[so this thing does have this concept of](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m49s)

[a host window](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m51s)

[which makes me wonder if it is throwing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m53s)

[things inside of a separate window](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h30m57s)

[uh screen capture XML](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m04s)

[it's trying to grab the stuff back out](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m08s)

[you make a good point though uh zailed](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m13s)

[to string](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m16s)

[XML text writer there's the text writer](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m19s)

[X document](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m21s)

[Builder tostring document root yeah but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m24s)

[where did you get this from](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m28s)

[interesting that those are the ones that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m36s)

[are getting dropped](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m38s)

[just from the root okay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m41s)

[those must be ones that are set by host](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m44s)

[window I would guess](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m50s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h31m58s)

[yeah so it takes it takes the element](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m04s)

[uses the xaml rider to push it in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m06s)

[so this is going to get the the runtime](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m10s)

[version of your elements](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m13s)

[which is not bad](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m18s)

[it but it is going to be a lot more a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m20s)

[lot closer to your Bama representation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m22s)

[than your xaml representation](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m24s)

[but in the case of this it doesn't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m29s)

[really matter how ugly it is because I I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m31s)

[had actually looked at using it uh um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m33s)

[oh Justin Bieber you may have just made](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m38s)

[my day](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m40s)

[you may have just made my day](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m41s)

[Hallelujah](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m47s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m50s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m52s)

[oh hallelujah thank you thank you thank](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h32m57s)

[you this makes me very happy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m01s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m08s)

[I do not want to give up my dance by](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m11s)

[no but you do make a good point there is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m15s)

[some improvement to be happening to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m17s)

[happen for example test the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m19s)

[um it was actually doing the display](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m22s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m24s)

[um was actually one of the things that I](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m26s)

[had considered with](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m28s)

[um show me the xaml so this is the thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m30s)

[that's actually powering all of these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m33s)

[little pop-ups](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m35s)

[the big difference between how show me](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m36s)

[the xaml is working and doing that XML](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m39s)

[reader on an element is this is done at](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m42s)

[compile time looking at the actual xaml](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m45s)

[file](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m47s)

[so it actually matches what was written](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m49s)

[inside the demo AB xaml versus versus](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m52s)

[trying to evaluate it at runtime because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m56s)

[some things get expanded out and it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h33m58s)

[ugly and the whole point was to try to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m00s)

[show users what xaml they needed to put](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m02s)

[in their app in order to make that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m05s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m07s)

[um sorry when you say what is that thing](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m09s)

[I assume that that's referring to DN spy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m11s)

[ex so dnspy is a uh decompiler](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m13s)

[for net that I have loved very dearly](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m18s)

[for a long time but the original author](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m20s)

[very suddenly one day Mark the repo is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m24s)

[archived](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m28s)

[and disappeared](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m29s)

[and there was like a real short Reddit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m32s)

[thread at one point at asking about what](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m35s)

[was going on and it was very I never](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m38s)

[fully understood the reason why it got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m40s)

[shut down](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m42s)

[but beauty of Open Source apparently](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m44s)

[somebody decided to continue on which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m46s)

[exciting it's also one of the few](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m48s)

[decompilers that has a debugger built in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m51s)

[so you can actually drop into uh dnspy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m54s)

[and do things like fire up an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h34m59s)

[assembly and debug into it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m01s)

[that's a thing you can do which is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m04s)

[frankly kind of Awesome](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m09s)

[like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m12s)

[we can do this](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m15s)

[and launch like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m18s)

[that's kind of cool that you could just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m21s)

[drop in the other thing you can do is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m25s)

[you can edit](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m27s)

[that's like](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m28s)

[the amount of power in this thing is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m30s)

[ridiculous because it'll take a dll](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m33s)

[let you make edits and see Sharp](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m36s)

[recompile those and reinsert the IL now](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m38s)

[obviously if the assembly was signed it](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m41s)

[can't resign unless you have the](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m43s)

[certificate and whatnot to redo that but](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m45s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m48s)

[it is my my go-to choice for decompiling](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m50s)

[and inspecting assemblies when I don't](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m54s)

[have like a repo or something to work](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m57s)

[with if I have a repo repos are better](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h35m58s)

[I'd rather get somebody's code than](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m02s)

[decompile their stuff because](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m04s)

[decompiling is always going to look a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m06s)

[little uglier](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m08s)

[but it's](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m09s)

[it is definitely my my preferred option](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m11s)

[and so hearing that it's no longer dead](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m14s)

[in somebody's uh keeping it going makes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m17s)

[me really happy](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m19s)

[okay I've been talking for two and a](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m23s)

[half hours straight](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m25s)

[I haven't had much caffeine so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m27s)

[I am probably going to wrap this up for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m29s)

[tonight in terms of the material design](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m33s)

[Library](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m35s)

[um Nikolai had commented earlier that](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m37s)

[he's got one other item he's working on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m39s)

[I might hold the four nine release for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m41s)

[in fact I'm going to just slap this on](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m45s)

[the Milestone](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m48s)

[I might hold the 4-9 release to try to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m50s)

[get this in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m53s)

[there there's nothing major in the four](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m54s)

[nine release but there's a lot of useful](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m56s)

[stuff in here and it's just slowly been](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h36m59s)

[growing I didn't know if I was going to](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m01s)

[actually release this or if I was just](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m04s)

[going to get the 5.0 stuff done I've got](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m06s)

[most of the theming things for the 5.0](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m08s)

[working and in](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m15s)

[I'm actually having the generator do](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m16s)

[writing the the test for it now too so](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m18s)

[that I can have reasonable](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m21s)

[test coverage over it because I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m23s)

[tired of it not working perfectly for](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m26s)

[those people who may not know what I'm](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m29s)

[talking about there is](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m31s)

[this and this these are the two these](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m35s)

[are the two big ones a bunch of broken](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m38s)

[changes have](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m40s)

[uh been done and then this theme brush](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m42s)

[rename is right now the old naming](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m47s)

[scheme didn't lend itself well to adding](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m50s)

[more brushes](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m53s)

[and I would like to be able to break out](https://youtu.be/zxeEdPe461s?t=02h37m55s)
