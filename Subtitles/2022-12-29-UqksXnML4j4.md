[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m01s)

[figured I would go back to the material](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m04s)

[design xaml project it's been a while](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m06s)

[I've let things kind of get out of hand](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m08s)

[I figured try to get the four seven](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m10s)

[stuff buttoned up and ready to go and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m12s)

[start prepping for the 5-0 release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m14s)

[there's a lot of uh breaking changes and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m16s)

[things that I'd like to see change and I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m19s)

[started bumping into some of those these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m21s)

[last couple weeks and I was like you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m22s)

[know it's probably time to start](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m24s)

[prepping that release it's gonna be big](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m25s)

[it's going to be ugly it's gonna make a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m27s)

[mess let's do it but first](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m28s)

[brain teaser I thought about posting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m32s)

[this on the uh the opening sequence](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m34s)

[leading into it and then didn't have it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m36s)

[prepped in time so I'm not going to give](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m38s)

[the answer now](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m40s)

[but here's the problem](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m41s)

[I've got a unit test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m44s)

[I've got a method called get Trixie Bool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m46s)

[and then I've got two assert statements](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m49s)

[to assert whether B is not equal to true](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m51s)

[and B is not equal to false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m54s)

[so the brain teaser implement this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h00m58s)

[method such that this test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m00s)

[assets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m03s)

[so that that's the brain teaser](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m06s)

[I'll slap the if anybody's interested](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m09s)

[there's uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m11s)

[ugh made of messed things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m12s)

[yucky okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m16s)

[so aside from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m18s)

[OBS and twitch not formatting that very](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m20s)

[nicely that's the brain teaser if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m22s)

[anybody's interested solution later](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m24s)

[uh for anybody who's interested in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m27s)

[wanting to make your head hurt about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m30s)

[there being more than two values for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m31s)

[Boolean since everybody will tell you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m34s)

[that a Boolean only has two values I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m36s)

[submit that it can have more than two](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m39s)

[so yes brain teaser Benjamin all you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m42s)

[have to do is write a method that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m46s)

[returns a bull](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m48s)

[where that Bool is not equal to true and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m49s)

[not equal to false how hard could it be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m51s)

[good luck](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m57s)

[and to be clear there's no funky IL](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h01m59s)

[manipulation or runtime manipulation or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m02s)

[any of that garbage none of that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m04s)

[these are the legit X unit assertions](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m07s)

[there's no changing it here it's all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m10s)

[about implementing this method and it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m13s)

[can be done with just plain old C sharp](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m15s)

[and you don't even need to be on latest](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m19s)

[version or anything old C sharp would](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m21s)

[work too I don't know how far back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m23s)

[but you can go back quite a ways](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m26s)

[probably like I don't know six five](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m27s)

[something like that so it's all C sharp](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m30s)

[syntax so just write a method that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m33s)

[returns a bull that's not true and not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m35s)

[false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m37s)

[okay material design in xaml](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m39s)

[material design and Zam](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m42s)

[boo so I was gonna go here there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m45s)

[couple pull requests I think I was going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m48s)

[to take a look at first first of all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m50s)

[we're gonna smash this icon thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m52s)

[get that in uh throw that into the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m55s)

[Milestone sure squash merge](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h02m58s)

[new icons away we go okay that's easy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m01s)

[let's take a look at this one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m03s)

[uh so let's check it real quick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m06s)

[uh let's see domain domain so this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m10s)

[all demo app stuff so that's fine so a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m12s)

[proven run there's nothing scary there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m15s)

[demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m20s)

[Noob can I just click the approve and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m22s)

[run button GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m25s)

[a proven run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m28s)

[I give my permission do the things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m34s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m36s)

[all this is is fix for 3808 so let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m40s)

[jump here I kind of want to just look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m44s)

[the issues](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m47s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m48s)

[got it so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m52s)

[perfect so found fixed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m54s)

[the issue I think this is wonderful](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h03m57s)

[let's get all of that fixed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m01s)

[I approve excellent excellent excellent](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m04s)

[excellent okay let's check and make sure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m07s)

[I'm not missing anything else there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m09s)

[xaml test error which we may Circle back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m10s)

[to there's this one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m12s)

[not a big deal this is the other one I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m15s)

[wanted to look at I'm going to slap this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m17s)

[one into the release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m19s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m21s)

[add this guy into the release as well](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m24s)

[okay so rotated combo box](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m30s)

[uh uh so when there's a rotate transform](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m34s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m37s)

[uh we'll be wrong for values other than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m44s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m46s)

[uh okay so we have the issue with the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m51s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h04m58s)

[this is actually interesting I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m00s)

[know if I've ever seen somebody rotate a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m03s)

[combo box](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m05s)

[this is one of those cases where I do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m10s)

[Wonder like I think it's fine to handle](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m12s)

[this but I do there's a certain amount](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m14s)

[of changes where at a certain point](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m17s)

[the template becomes very purpose-built](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m20s)

[but let's take a look it's probably not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m25s)

[terrible so this is just demo app so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m27s)

[we're going to ignore that for the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m29s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m30s)

[uh Boolean to double converter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m32s)

[this is once again just demo app stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m36s)

[so I don't care that much the converter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m39s)

[looks fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m41s)

[so I will make one one comment here this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m44s)

[pattern with a markup extension for a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m47s)

[value converter I used to love this a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m49s)

[lot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m52s)

[um and it's still it's not a bad thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m53s)

[to do just to be clear this is totally](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m55s)

[legit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m57s)

[um what it allows you to do and there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h05m59s)

[probably an example here uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m01s)

[uh yeah Boolean to double it allows you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m04s)

[to get away with stuff like this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m06s)

[right where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m08s)

[you rather than declaring the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m10s)

[um the converter up in your resources](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m13s)

[and then static resource down below and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m15s)

[whatnot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m17s)

[it lets you just declare your converter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m19s)

[in line](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m21s)

[which is great simpler more concise](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m22s)

[syntax a lot less typing all of those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m25s)

[things are good](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m27s)

[the the only reason I've moved away from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m29s)

[telling people about it or recommending](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m32s)

[it is because if you use this type of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m34s)

[value converter inside of something like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m37s)

[a data template that gets applied to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m40s)

[something like a list you're creating a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m42s)

[new instance](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m45s)

[of your converter every single time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m46s)

[and usually that's not a big deal but in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m50s)

[things like lists where performance and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m53s)

[memory start to add up there's been a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m55s)

[number of times where I've seen this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m57s)

[pattern just bloat memory because of how](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h06m58s)

[many instances this gets created because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m01s)

[if you uh declare your value converter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m04s)

[inside your resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m07s)

[and then reference it with a static](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m09s)

[resource all of those things you'll get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m11s)

[one instance and they'll all reuse the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m13s)

[same instance so there's that uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m15s)

[uh uses Flags enumes ooh good good](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m19s)

[question Justin Bieber so going back to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m22s)

[the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m24s)

[where is it this guy uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m25s)

[no the the signature of the method that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m29s)

[I have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m32s)

[uh is just return so it's straight up uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m33s)

[bull return](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m38s)

[so nothing fancier than that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m41s)

[nice thought though it's fun to get it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m45s)

[fun to get the brain ticking uh okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m47s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m51s)

[this assumes a layout transform and a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m53s)

[specifically a layout transform of a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m57s)

[rotate transform](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h07m59s)

[this is where things start to get weird](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m04s)

[because there's multiple ways to do it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m07s)

[and a common pattern on a lot of these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m08s)

[transform properties is to not just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m11s)

[declare your rotate transform directly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m13s)

[but to create a transform group](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m15s)

[and apply the group directly this would](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m18s)

[not handle the group case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m21s)

[and I don't know if that's a big issue](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m25s)

[or not I do like this Epsilon comparison](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m28s)

[so people not familiar with here and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m31s)

[I'll make this a little bigger](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m33s)

[that's a little bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m35s)

[I wish I could collapse](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m37s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m40s)

[so this pattern here the math absolute](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m41s)

[value](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m45s)

[and then doing a less than or equal to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m46s)

[this is a common way of doing floating](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m49s)

[Point comparisons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m51s)

[because if you just do a double equals](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m53s)

[on a double value you run into uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m55s)

[rounding issues where two doubles may](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h08m58s)

[not be equal](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m02s)

[uh even though they legitimately should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m04s)

[be because there's certain values that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m06s)

[can't be accurately represented with the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m08s)

[devil so the solution is typically to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m13s)

[like add or subtract](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m14s)

[and then uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m17s)

[compare to see if it is close to an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m19s)

[Epsilon so in this case it's looking for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m21s)

[negative 90 because it's adding 90](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m23s)

[taking the absolute value and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m26s)

[checking to see if it's a really tiny](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m29s)

[number meaning is this close to zero](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m31s)

[so this may not be obvious what it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m35s)

[doing but it that's effectively what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m37s)

[it's doing and then down here is the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m38s)

[inverse it's looking for positive 90](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m40s)

[because it subtracts 90 and then checks](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m42s)

[for hey is this a a tiny rotation so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m44s)

[which which made sense this is looking](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m47s)

[for 90 degree transforms](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m49s)

[yeah like this code is as I would expect](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h09m57s)

[it is as I would expect I wonder if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m04s)

[I wonder if the better solution is just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m12s)

[to expose](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m15s)

[expose the callbacks](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m19s)

[I wonder if that might be better](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m24s)

[because there's all these situation like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m27s)

[I can like I said I could see this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m29s)

[breaking very quickly as soon as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m30s)

[somebody take like it works for my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m32s)

[rotate transform but as soon as I throw](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m34s)

[that rotate transform inside of a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m35s)

[transfer group everything fails](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m37s)

[that's not real great that we end up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m39s)

[with a another weird problem and I'm](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m42s)

[wondering if a better solution is to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m44s)

[allow for putting a call back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m47s)

[on the combo box itself](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m51s)

[that way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h10m58s)

[that way users could provide it because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m01s)

[it's really hard for this library to try](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m03s)

[to account for every possible case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m06s)

[that a transform could do and then more](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m09s)

[importantly that same comment from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m11s)

[Nikolai on the working around the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m14s)

[symptoms](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m17s)

[this seemed like a better approach how](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m36s)

[it ever works with the current](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m37s)

[implementation because of special](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m38s)

[placement handling here yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m40s)

[so this this all works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m52s)

[I'm just wondering if it's better to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h11m58s)

[give the use the the collar more control](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m01s)

[over the placement](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m04s)

[and showing an example in the demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m07s)

[rather than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m09s)

[rather than trying to handle it inside](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m11s)

[I think we're gonna hold off on this one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m19s)

[for the moment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m20s)

[again the change isn't bad I'm just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m23s)

[wondering if it's the wrong change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m25s)

[that's technically all internal stuff so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m27s)

[we could refactor and change it later](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m30s)

[but it would be a behavioral change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m32s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m38s)

[I I think that's where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m40s)

[and check and see I don't see Nikolai in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m44s)

[the chat](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m47s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m49s)

[I'm gonna let that one sit for a minute](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m51s)

[and think on it okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m52s)

[given that uh let's see this one passed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m55s)

[ah squash more squash merch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h12m59s)

[and then let's go grab](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m03s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m06s)

[that guy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m09s)

[and close issue](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m12s)

[this thing no longer needs evaluation](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m15s)

[great great great it's demo app not real](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m17s)

[concerned not real concerned at all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m20s)

[okay let's check the Milestone and I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m23s)

[want to look because I think one of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m25s)

[these is a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m27s)

[there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m30s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m33s)

[yeah so do do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m44s)

[okay let's jump back here real quick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m49s)

[The Flipper stuff I think I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m52s)

[punt](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m54s)

[it's it's gonna be a breaking change no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m56s)

[matter how it goes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h13m59s)

[so I think we're gonna save](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m09s)

[can I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m10s)

[just punch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m13s)

[you like that and move all of those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m15s)

[forward because those are all the same](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m18s)

[underlying root cause okay this one here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m19s)

[I think is what I was thinking of yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m23s)

[okay so there's some build conflicts so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m27s)

[let's look at this and see about trying](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m30s)

[to either rebase or merge or do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m31s)

[something so I'm the let's just double](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m34s)

[check I think the conflicts our demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m36s)

[yeah so this is a demo app conflict](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m40s)

[which I'm somewhat tempted to just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m42s)

[remake manually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m44s)

[because the demo app I think had major](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m47s)

[refactors so is hit test visible uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m50s)

[false their Ripple assist disabled true](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h14m56s)

[Ripple assist disabled true so this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m03s)

[fine it's just the demo app bit that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m06s)

[causing us grief so let's see about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m09s)

[rebasing this 2938](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m11s)

[let's go have some fun with get crack](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m13s)

[get cracking you are my friend let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m17s)

[let's go see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m21s)

[uh let's see here so this I think this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m23s)

[is where I was looking at it before if I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m26s)

[remember right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m28s)

[uh check out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m36s)

[I don't really want to reset my master](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m40s)

[pointer so how about fix 2938](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m42s)

[00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:56,820](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m45s)

we'll use that okay so this is

[this is the guy here that we really want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m52s)

[oh I guess I already did this like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m56s)

[multiple times over didn't I oops](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h15m58s)

[whatever okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m00s)

[I kind of just want to rebase this guy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m05s)

[straight up on top of my master and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m07s)

[deal with the conflicts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m09s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m12s)

[why is this okay actually you know what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m17s)

[this is going to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m21s)

[miserable if we go at it this way stop](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m23s)

[abort abort abort abort](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m29s)

[back up where's my master](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m31s)

[there you are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m34s)

[just bring master in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m37s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m41s)

[what are you squawking about okay so I'm](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m44s)

[gonna close Visual Studio before it does](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m46s)

[anything crazy like try to be helpful](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m48s)

[I don't know why you're open](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m52s)

[that's open good the only one I need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h16m56s)

[and then you can wait for just a second](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m01s)

[okay so Master right click merge in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m03s)

[there's the conflict](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m07s)

[let's address](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m09s)

[what was the original change that we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m17s)

[were going for here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m19s)

[this was specifically adding this item](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m21s)

[template](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m24s)

[here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m26s)

[seems fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m30s)

[uh uh let's see and I'm guessing it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m33s)

[just the formatting of this that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m36s)

[that's biting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m38s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m41s)

[uh let's see here so we have data](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m44s)

[template](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m47s)

[uh so we kind of wanted to combine merge](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m52s)

[okay so I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m56s)

[is take this take everything on master](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h17m59s)

[and then I'm going to manually bring in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m03s)

[the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m06s)

[the demo app change I think that's the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m08s)

[easy way to handle this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m11s)

[because there's just too much going on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m15s)

[here that's going to be problematic](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m18s)

[let's go here okay so close you don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m30s)

[need you any more close close make sure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m34s)

[we're building](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m37s)

[and then demos demo app tips](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m39s)

[apps apps](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m47s)

[uh somewhere around the 560 area](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m53s)

[uh five six zero](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h18m56s)

[our neck come on up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m00s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m04s)

[I want to expand this guy out and see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m11s)

[where we were at tabs with display](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m13s)

[member path that's the one we were doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m16s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m23s)

[yeah so this here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m33s)

[I don't know if we have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m46s)

[yeah so we dropped that but this thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m51s)

[was less about that and more about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m54s)

[adding in the item template](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h19m59s)

[let's compare the item templates really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m01s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m03s)

[custom header close command](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m04s)

[all of that stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m12s)

[and then this one here had the content](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m16s)

[margin font size](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m19s)

[content margin font size so that should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m22s)

[be equivalent okay so let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m24s)

[let's get a run through this and see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m31s)

[what's going on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m33s)

[and we go tabs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m36s)

[and let's see we are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m40s)

[remember what we called this thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m55s)

[there we go custom items](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h20m58s)

[got it so when you click on the X](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m03s)

[interesting so that still works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m09s)

[when it's selected it doesn't do the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m14s)

[Ripple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m16s)

[and if you click right on the button the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m18s)

[button takes precedence and doesn't fall](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m20s)

[through to the underline one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m22s)

[okay that seems](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m25s)

[that seems reasonable](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m28s)

[it's kind of what I would expect](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m33s)

[that will double as the validation test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m40s)

[uh let's see heading back in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m41s)

[uh to uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m46s)

[demo app change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m49s)

[commit push](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m52s)

[okay so that should trigger refresh good](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h21m56s)

[double check the changes here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m02s)

[that looks fine that looks fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m05s)

[this stop knocked down a level](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m08s)

[let's go and do that real quick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m11s)

[let's see five](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m14s)

[six two](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m17s)

[actually it looked it probably should be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m20s)

[bumped down](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m22s)

[I'm gonna say that that's more correct](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m25s)

[oh it's weird that GitHub is displaying](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m31s)

[it like this it because of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m33s)

[indentation this line This 564 is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m34s)

[wrapping](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m37s)

[that just looks funny okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m38s)

[that just looks funny okay we're gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m41s)

[hit approve submit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m43s)

[and then that will get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m45s)

[let's see enable auto merge confirm Auto](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m48s)

[merge](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m50s)

[this is in four seven let's make sure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m52s)

[you are in four seven good good good](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h22m57s)

[and we may](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m04s)

[let's bump you two out of the milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m08s)

[for now](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m11s)

[so I'm not 100 co wait that not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m14s)

[GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m19s)

[Milestone oh no milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m21s)

[okay I'm sorry GitHub for not trusting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m24s)

[you and this one here we can drop the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m26s)

[waiting on feedback](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m29s)

[because we fixed it ourselves and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m32s)

[let's go back here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m35s)

[this is the issue for it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m42s)

[and then let's look at this one because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m48s)

[it claims to be similar I have a list](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m50s)

[box](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m52s)

[I would like to use a button but the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m54s)

[button's click event doesn't get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m56s)

[recognized like it was handled before](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h23m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m06s)

[yeah so I'm gonna put waiting on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m13s)

[feedback on this one because I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m16s)

[this one has a workaround](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m18s)

[because there is that that trade-off of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m23s)

[if you're trying to change the behavior](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m32s)

[that's probably what's biting you so if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m34s)

[you set the top we don't do a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m37s)

[attached properties in this library that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m39s)

[that change Behavior because I find it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m42s)

[to be really unintuitive in a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m44s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m46s)

[but this guy here is what is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m48s)

[doing it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m51s)

[so this is slightly different than the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m52s)

[other one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m54s)

[so I don't think that's actually related](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h24m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m01s)

[we will drop the waiting on feedback](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m04s)

[there that should merge that should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m06s)

[complete everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m08s)

[okay next up I think what we are going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m11s)

[to do is we are going to take a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m14s)

[take a run at trying to automate out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m21s)

[this release I think is where is where I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m22s)

[want to go next so right now releases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m25s)

[take a bit of work and that's annoying](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m28s)

[the crap out of me I would very much](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m30s)

[like it if a release could be this easy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m32s)

[I would like to hit draft new release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m34s)

[I would like to create a tag a v 4.7.0](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m38s)

[right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m45s)

[I would like to click this generate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m46s)

[release notes button](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m49s)

[and then I'd like to be done](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m51s)

[this is how hard like I want the rest of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m53s)

[the process to be put in motion by this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m56s)

[so I don't have to think real hard this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h25m58s)

[is this is the goal](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m01s)

[this is the goal and this does a pretty](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m03s)

[good job of it so just for people who](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m07s)

[aren't familiar with it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m10s)

[um that auto gen release notes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m12s)

[uh you can configure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m14s)

[what goes in there with one of these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m17s)

[release.yaml files](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m20s)

[so you'll note that there's a few things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m22s)

[in here that I've got is I I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m24s)

[intentionally exclude anything that gets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m26s)

[labeled as ignore for release because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m28s)

[it's ignored no one cares](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m31s)

[I also eliminate the the bot accounts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m33s)

[that don't really matter because these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m37s)

[don't really matter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m41s)

[we do have some key changes and some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m42s)

[breaking changes and all of that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m44s)

[um but there's a handful of other things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m47s)

[that that probably need to happen so for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m49s)

[example](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m52s)

[I've got this generate Milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m53s)

[contributors](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h26m59s)

[that I would love to be able to to do so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m00s)

[there's a previous stream where we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m04s)

[actually built out this particular](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m06s)

[action so this is a uh a custom action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m09s)

[set up here that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m12s)

[is a little different so the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m15s)

[generated release notes they go through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m18s)

[and identify contributors but I I firmly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m20s)

[believe that people who test out issues](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m25s)

[comment provide feedback all of those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m27s)

[things count and so I have a slightly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m30s)

[different way that I prefer to count](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m34s)

[contributors versus just straight pull](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m36s)

[requests which doesn't it feels a little](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m37s)

[more accurate as far as people who are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m40s)

[actually making contributions because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m42s)

[sometimes there are contributions that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m44s)

[aren't direct pull requests because I've](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m46s)

[had people go through and write a bunch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m48s)

[of docs for me that is hugely valuable](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m49s)

[that should count](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m52s)

[so we wrote this guy up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m54s)

[and this will go through and gen up the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h27m57s)

[information](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m00s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m01s)

[close to what I want right I can gen it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m03s)

[but I would like to actually plug this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m07s)

[in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m10s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m13s)

[get it actually working all the way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m14s)

[through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m16s)

[sorry a colleague is being weird and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m18s)

[messaging me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m20s)

[quit boom there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m27s)

[so turn that off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m28s)

[okay so you can see here it actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m30s)

[generated the output came through pulls](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m32s)

[it all out it also does a handful of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m35s)

[other things like omit me from the list](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m37s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m39s)

[so but this does have all of the output](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m43s)

[so I'd kind of like to to tie some of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m45s)

[these bits together and make this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m48s)

[process go a little bit nicer the other](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m50s)

[thing I would love is when I draft a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m53s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h28m56s)

[like I would like to hit save as draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m06s)

[and then have the whole process go into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m07s)

[motion so I can review it and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m09s)

[publish the draft like ideally I'd like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m12s)

[to get all of the binaries attached and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m15s)

[all of that stuff going so I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m16s)

[that's where we're gonna go next is I'd](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m19s)

[like to try to start trying to automate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m21s)

[a little bit of this process to make it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m23s)

[to make my life not suck so that we can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m25s)

[generate like I'd like to be able to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m27s)

[kick releases out really quickly and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m29s)

[right now I can't and that makes me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m31s)

[annoyed so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m34s)

[uh annoyance is the mother of invention](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m35s)

[or something like that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m37s)

[show we're gonna we're gonna clean this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m40s)

[stuff up a little bit so let's let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m42s)

[start uh uh let's go into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h29m44s)

[browser browser level work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m01s)

[okay uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m05s)

[uh cancel](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m13s)

[why do I have uncommitted changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m15s)

[the revert discard any changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m18s)

[uh release process so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m40s)

[which branch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m44s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m49s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m50s)

[here we go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m51s)

[let's take a let's take a look here at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m53s)

[what is firing so this is firing on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m55s)

[the creation of a tag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h30m58s)

[I think we kind of want to turn that off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m02s)

[because the creation of that tag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m12s)

[not really what I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m15s)

[because that's what's pushing stuff out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m19s)

[and I kind of want to just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m24s)

[not do that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m26s)

[set nightly release version numbers](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m32s)

[because I kind of want to just block all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m34s)

[all releases for the moment so that I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m38s)

[can play with this without](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m40s)

[have to it we're gonna have to actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m49s)

[set it up to trigger appropriately so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m51s)

[there's gonna need to be some work there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m56s)

[I think all I need to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h31m59s)

[is let's start by turning this off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m03s)

[or actually we can just avoid pushing a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m07s)

[tag with v in front of it and call it a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m09s)

[day](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m12s)

[and then we won't have to worry about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m13s)

[this cool so we can powwow from our own](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m15s)

[Branch okay uh GitHub actions](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m16s)

[documentation so what I want to find is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m21s)

[the the trigger](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m23s)

[for events that trigger workflows I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m28s)

[to confirm that there is an event that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m31s)

[triggers when I do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m34s)

[so we're not going to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m40s)

[three](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m43s)

[I want to confirm that this creates it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m44s)

[and obviously this is probably going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m52s)

[uh I want to get out of here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h32m54s)

[uh so that's gonna do it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m06s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m08s)

[did it just go live](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m10s)

[uh uh delete this release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m13s)

[we're gonna get real good at deleting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m17s)

[I'm going to keep my hand away from the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m37s)

[enter key](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m39s)

[release 1.2](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m41s)

[General these notes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m47s)

[okay so the key things we want is the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m49s)

[contributor stuff added and the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m57s)

[and the artifacts added to this draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h33m58s)

[release that's what we're going for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m01s)

[okay so we want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m04s)

[draft release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m06s)

[let's go here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m09s)

[okay so we probably want web hook](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m14s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m16s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m21s)

[I assume either created or unpublished](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m25s)

[is going to be what we're looking for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m30s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m35s)

[when stable and pre-release publishes we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m44s)

[don't really do pre-release publishes so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m47s)

[that doesn't matter to me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m52s)

[okay so created is not fired for draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m55s)

[releases so that is explicitly not what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h34m58s)

[I want because I definitely want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m01s)

[draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m03s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m06s)

[I'm guessing if created isn't it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m12s)

[pre-released must be what I am looking](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m19s)

[for I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m22s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m24s)

[let's start there uh let's see okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m30s)

[uh what do we call this uh package](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m34s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m37s)

[something like that maybe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m41s)

[okay so we're gonna start there and we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m43s)

[are going to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m45s)

[we're going to assume that pre-released](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m48s)

[is the trigger that or the specific type](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m50s)

[that we want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m52s)

[um let's see here we're also going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m55s)

[add workflow dispatch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h35m57s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m00s)

[I pretty much always add that and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m02s)

[let's do a name of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m04s)

[uh I don't know](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m06s)

[package release or how about prepare](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m09s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m12s)

[might actually be a better name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m15s)

[uh let's see rename](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m17s)

[pair release okay great okay so step one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m22s)

[we're gonna do uh jobs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m28s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m33s)

[inside we'll create a job that is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m42s)

[uh collect](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m45s)

[distributors](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m48s)

[think and we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m51s)

[and do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h36m57s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m02s)

[there we're going to do that maneuver](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m07s)

[that maneuver](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m09s)

[about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m13s)

[a list of contributors](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m15s)

[all of this stuff this stuff run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m19s)

[about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m25s)

[show](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m28s)

[and then here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m33s)

[I would like to know if there is a way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m37s)

[GitHub ref is going to be the tag name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m43s)

[so in this case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m51s)

[I want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m55s)

[uh I believe it's the GitHub context](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h37m58s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m01s)

[uh GitHub ref](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m04s)

[let's confirm that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m08s)

[breath oh what was that nope](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m15s)

[seven six five four three two one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m18s)

[uh let's see where the contexts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m22s)

[X](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m28s)

[uh yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m31s)

[and the GitHub context I would like to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m33s)

[look at that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m36s)

[I believe you have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m38s)

[a ref of the action being executed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m41s)

[uh I thought I would see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m46s)

[I think what we actually want is action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m55s)

[Wrath](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h38m57s)

[for a step executing action this is the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m03s)

[ref of the execution being](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m05s)

[executed oh no no no no no that's not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m08s)

[what I want that's not what I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m15s)

[workflows triggered by a release this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m18s)

[the release tag created](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m20s)

[so I do I want GitHub reference the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m22s)

[magical](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m25s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m26s)

[um which means I probably can't do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m28s)

[workflow dispatch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m38s)

[and this is we right now it is making](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m39s)

[the assumption that the Milestone is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m42s)

[linked here and I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m45s)

[I think that's an okay assumption but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m48s)

[we'll need to uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h39m58s)

[we'll need to validate that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m05s)

[okay I think that's good the problem is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m10s)

[is I can't test this on a side branch I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m12s)

[don't think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m15s)

[so we're gonna we're gonna try to build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m18s)

[out as much of this as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m19s)

[possible](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m26s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m28s)

[uh build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m31s)

[artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m34s)

[but we want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m36s)

[that maneuver](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m44s)

[so we want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m47s)

[this at least to start](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h40m53s)

[what is there it is there's my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m05s)

[multi-cursor](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m07s)

[okay so we want to do checkout build and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m09s)

[test this is going to need all of those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m11s)

[thingies to find](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m15s)

[uh which is fine we can get those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m17s)

[thingies up here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m25s)

[I wonder if there's a way I can reach](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m30s)

[back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m33s)

[I don't think there is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m35s)

[I was just wondering if there's a way to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m38s)

[go back to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m40s)

[and look and see if there's already a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m43s)

[build and use those generated artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m45s)

[this is pull request verification I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m53s)

[thought I clicked on a master build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h41m55s)

[and interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m01s)

[all right because those don't trigger](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m06s)

[until nightly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m08s)

[uh I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m11s)

[something like this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m16s)

[got it so I would have to go back and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m21s)

[find one that actually ran and did](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m23s)

[something](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m27s)

[and this one should have artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m30s)

[associated with it yeah so that's the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m33s)

[hard part because I build artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m34s)

[nightly rather than on demand we are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m37s)

[going to need a compilation okay that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m40s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m42s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m44s)

[build and test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m47s)

[we are I'm I'm quickly thinking these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m50s)

[versions are going to need to move](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m53s)

[somewhere](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h42m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m01s)

[I'm not really sure how much value this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m02s)

[one is behind me over this one but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m04s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m06s)

[just how often have I ever changed this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m08s)

[I think the answer is never](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m10s)

[um okay so that will get me artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m14s)

[let's go back here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m18s)

[go get me the build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m21s)

[I have Push artifacts what does this one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m27s)

[actually do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m29s)

[upload nougats upload demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m33s)

[so this is all fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m41s)

[this pushes the okay so this is this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m44s)

[will work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m47s)

[so we could we could actually do this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m51s)

[this is normally limited](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h43m59s)

[in how it triggers](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m01s)

[but we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m04s)

[push artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m06s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m10s)

[let's do that back you up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m11s)

[insert you a little bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m16s)

[you should have all of those that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m19s)

[still fine that's still fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m21s)

[um I do need to make sure that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m24s)

[I think if we're going to merge this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m28s)

[we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m30s)

[real quickie do this maneuver so we are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m32s)

[going to temporarily just turn that off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m36s)

[I don't wanna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m38s)

[I don't want to deal with that right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m40s)

[this second](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m41s)

[that that seems like a bad idea](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m42s)

[okay so this will push artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m44s)

[and add them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h44m55s)

[so that's fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m00s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m03s)

[the only problem I have though is maybe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m04s)

[I shouldn't use this composite action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m08s)

[because this guy here is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m12s)

[doing more than I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m20s)

[I'm going to just take these steps into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m25s)

[here and ax this thing all together](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m27s)

[because I only want this thing because I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m31s)

[want to push stuff up onto the uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m35s)

[under the release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m39s)

[I don't want to actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m42s)

[I don't want to actually send them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m47s)

[anywhere and I'm okay uploading them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m49s)

[onto the the build Run 2 just as a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m50s)

[validation mechanism](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m53s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m55s)

[because I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h45m58s)

[here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m00s)

[is so that'll do contributors that'll do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m02s)

[that uh update release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m05s)

[I think is what we want here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m10s)

[right so we're going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m12s)

[this maneuver](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m14s)

[uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m16s)

[put that on there uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m24s)

[build artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m27s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m30s)

[because I also want I'm also going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m32s)

[stuff for me as well](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m37s)

[uh let's see here and then I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m39s)

[this one actually was setting a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m50s)

[yeah this other one was setting a runs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m52s)

[on we need to make sure we get that as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m55s)

[well because this one actually we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m57s)

[going to run on Windows because we got](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h46m59s)

[to do some stuff on Windows](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m01s)

[uh okay so there's that there's that I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m03s)

[think all that's fine this guy is going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m06s)

[to need a unintended](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m09s)

[he's going to need a need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m11s)

[so this update release job is going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m13s)

[need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m17s)

[the collect contributors to be completed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m19s)

[and the build artifacts to be completed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m23s)

[before he can run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m26s)

[uh we can do a runs on Ubuntu latest](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m30s)

[because we don't need anything fancy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m34s)

[and then what we want to do is find the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m37s)

[incantation to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m41s)

[uh update release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m44s)

[GitHub action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m47s)

[update draft release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m50s)

[yeah I kind of just want to go to the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h47m59s)

[marketplace](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m01s)

[uh more than an hour why another build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m07s)

[publisher blah blah blah okay so show me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m10s)

[uh I don't care about that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m20s)

[and you should get access differently](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m25s)

[all of us need to do continuous or at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m32s)

[least on GitHub uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m34s)

[kind of I'm surprised to see that so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m39s)

[let's see released](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h48m58s)

[I kind of feel like I could also just do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m05s)

[this with the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m07s)

[okay uh let's just look at the GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m11s)

[CLI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m14s)

[okay uh let's see and maybe we should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m19s)

[update real quick before I get too](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m22s)

[carried away](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m24s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m26s)

[uh I think I am installed with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m32s)

[well let's let's see I can't remember](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m39s)

[whether I did choco or wind git on this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m43s)

[I'm gonna find out here in just a second](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m45s)

[winged it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m47s)

[because I I feel like this is an easy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m56s)

[operation on the CLI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h49m58s)

[but what do I know](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m05s)

[okay so GitHub there we go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m07s)

[okay so I want to look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m11s)

[something about releases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m16s)

[like GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m19s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m21s)

[uh let's see I don't want to create](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m25s)

[I would like to GitHub release upload](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m29s)

[that looks like step one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m32s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m37s)

[overwrites existing assets have the same](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m40s)

[name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m42s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m44s)

[this kind of looks like what I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m46s)

[GitHub release upload I need tag and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m48s)

[files followed by flags and I think for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m52s)

[flag we want clobber](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m55s)

[uh inherited Flags we are going to need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h50m57s)

[to specify a repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m00s)

[and that seems pretty simple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m03s)

[most re owner repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m07s)

[and we just have to identify it by tag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m10s)

[okay that seemed I feel like we just do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m16s)

[this with the GitHub CLI this this feels](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m20s)

[a little too easy right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m23s)

[uh okay so we're gonna go back to here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m27s)

[I'm gonna do uh name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m31s)

[uh download](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m36s)

[artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m39s)

[well we'll come back to you in a minute](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m41s)

[name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m43s)

[uh add](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m46s)

[artifacts to release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m49s)

[uh let's see run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m52s)

[uh what is it is it that I think it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h51m57s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m00s)

[and then this is going to be the ref](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m02s)

[we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m11s)

[I'm going to put it in quotes just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m13s)

[because I don't trust myself to not put](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m15s)

[spaces in and then I need to download](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m17s)

[artifacts so there is a action for doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m21s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m26s)

[and I think I use it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m28s)

[right here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m31s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m37s)

[download artifacts yeah this thing I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m38s)

[want this thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m42s)

[uh okay so boom](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m43s)

[download artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m47s)

[and then we just need the artifact name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m57s)

[this is doing nougat's run number](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h52m59s)

[um I kind of want to look at this one to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m08s)

[see if there's a I kind of want this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m10s)

[thing to clobber if it runs multiple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m12s)

[times](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m15s)

[uh so let's look at that real quick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m17s)

[so four actions if you ever want to look](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m20s)

[them up you literally do github.com your](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m22s)

[action and that'll take you to the repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m25s)

[so I'm kind of wondering if there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m31s)

[way to tell it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m33s)

[to clobber](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m36s)

[uploading to the same artifact](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m41s)

[uh upload artifact with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m48s)

[each article phases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m55s)

[actually we have multiple jobs yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h53m59s)

[that's kind of what I want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m06s)

[so don't upload from multiple jobs fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m09s)

[we're not doing that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m15s)

[I feel like I missed something here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m17s)

[wonderful I don't know if I named](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m21s)

[artifact by D](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m23s)

[the following example the available](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m26s)

[artifact name artifact by default if no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m28s)

[name is provide would contain both](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m31s)

[uh World txt hello and extra file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m33s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m45s)

[so I can do this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m50s)

[and I don't need to worry about it okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m53s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m55s)

[that is a little bit nicer then so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m56s)

[don't need to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h54m59s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h55m01s)

[I don't need to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h55m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h55m05s)

[okay uh I would like to look at download](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=00h55m06s)

[created rather than saved as draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h09m45s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h09m58s)

[what is I wish I knew what all of these](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m04s)

[things were](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m07s)

[or exactly which interactions triggered](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m09s)

[each of them so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m11s)

[if we go back and look at this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m17s)

[to what do we got here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m25s)

[publish release save as draft](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m28s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m47s)

[because we could publish the release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h10m54s)

[what does a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m02s)

[what is what we're going to do we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m07s)

[going to go powwow on a different uh I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m08s)

[need a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m11s)

[one that's not going to trigger anything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m18s)

[you'll do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m19s)

[okay releases great new release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m25s)

[uh best](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m30s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m32s)

[you see a whole bunch of stuff great](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m34s)

[uh publish release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m40s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m44s)

[that goes out the door](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m48s)

[that builds the first release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h11m56s)

[sorry Joe if you're watching I just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m02s)

[spammed you a little bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m05s)

[the only thing I don't like about doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m13s)

[this is the build up here you know I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m15s)

[guess the other thing we could do is we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m18s)

[could](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m19s)

[let's look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m21s)

[we could rather than we don't have to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m23s)

[trigger it from the UI we could trigger](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m26s)

[it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m28s)

[from a manual from uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m29s)

[yeah what if we did it from a workflow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m34s)

[dispatch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m37s)

[yeah and did something like this what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m39s)

[are my options here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m42s)

[see I wonder if this might be better](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m46s)

[because then we could build it up and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m50s)

[determine yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m52s)

[okay I like this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h12m55s)

[I like this better](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m02s)

[let's do that that gives us a little bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m04s)

[more control](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m07s)

[and then more importantly we can test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m08s)

[this from a side branch before just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m10s)

[cowboying everything straight on into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m12s)

[yes yes yes okay this is coming together](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m15s)

[this makes me feel this makes me feel](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m19s)

[more warm and fuzzy okay so rather than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m22s)

[doing that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m25s)

[we are going to do something similar to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m27s)

[this where we have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m30s)

[a workflow dispatch and we're just going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m31s)

[to ask for the incoming version](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m34s)

[I think that I think that makes a lot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m36s)

[more sense](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m38s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m43s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m45s)

[I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m46s)

[we're gonna not trigger there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m47s)

[we're gonna go here and we're gonna call](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m50s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m54s)

[version](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h13m58s)

[uh milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m01s)

[called milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m02s)

[you generate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m06s)

[a release four](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m08s)

[okay cool cool cool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m11s)

[that all works that all works so this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m14s)

[then becomes inputs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m18s)

[same one that we had here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m21s)

[inputs.milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m22s)

[this becomes input stop Milestone so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m25s)

[this is where we're going to type in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m27s)

[four seven up maybe we'll do a little](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m28s)

[sanity checking there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m31s)

[um we need to find the other places we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m34s)

[use that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m36s)

[breath and kill it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m39s)

[yeah so we want to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m42s)

[okay so we are not going to do this uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m44s)

[how about this is going to become create](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m49s)

[release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m52s)

[rather than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m53s)

[uh uh and then this will become](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m55s)

[free release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h14m59s)

[yes yes yes yes yes yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m02s)

[uh release create okay this is this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m05s)

[what we want to do this is what we want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m09s)

[to do so we do release create](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m13s)

[tag files](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m16s)

[yeah so there's the tag so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m20s)

[go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m22s)

[release create B](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m24s)

[and then I want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m26s)

[what is the to do I want to go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m30s)

[inputs dot milestone](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m35s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m39s)

[for the tag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m41s)

[um we want to use the generated release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m43s)

[notes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m46s)

[for the moment we're going to add some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m49s)

[more stuff to it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m52s)

[and then we want to path to assets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h15m54s)

[and my display label here so we can do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m00s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m03s)

[so we want to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m07s)

[this maneuver here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m09s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m12s)

[uh nougats](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m16s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m19s)

[nugets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m21s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m24s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m27s)

[demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m29s)

[and demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m32s)

[so we're gonna do a space I'm feeling](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m37s)

[I'm feeling confident](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m38s)

[got it so let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m44s)

[we're gonna push this one straight into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m48s)

[master](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m50s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m51s)

[updating release process](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m53s)

[we'll send it here because I think I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m57s)

[have to do that to get the trigger to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h16m59s)

[fire correctly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m01s)

[in the UI at least](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m02s)

[uh this we want to kill because I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m05s)

[want to waste time okay coming back and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m08s)

[then prepare release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m12s)

[so we would like to run workflow off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m14s)

[master](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m16s)

[the Milestone would be 4.7.0](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m18s)

[we want to run the workflow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m21s)

[and then crossing fingers everything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m24s)

[works flawlessly first time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m26s)

[there's no way anything goes wrong](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m29s)

[because I don't mind](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m33s)

[a trigger like this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m36s)

[okay so it's fired up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m40s)

[a couple jobs going this one's going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m43s)

[build artifacts is going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m45s)

[and then hopefully all this just works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h17m51s)

[to I see red no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m05s)

[okay so build and test it's gonna do all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m09s)

[the needful](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m12s)

[and then I am interested in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m17s)

[understanding if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m19s)

[the combination of if you feed it a file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m21s)

[plus gen release notes how those things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m24s)

[interact](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m27s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m29s)

[title and notes for the release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m30s)

[oh I think we probably also want latest](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m35s)

[on the end of it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m41s)

[read release notes from file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h18m54s)

[yeah I'm not sure we really care about a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m03s)

[lot of these things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m09s)

[abort in the case oh so we might](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m12s)

[actually have to create the tag too](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m15s)

[interactively create a release from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m23s)

[specify tag oh this isn't going to work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m26s)

[because we didn't tell it what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m30s)

[oh I guess it would know the repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m33s)

[it would know the repo because we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m37s)

[running inside of an action okay so okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m39s)

[so it should pick that up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m42s)

[I'll be curious to see what it does so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m45s)

[this this guy finished which is great](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m46s)

[agenda list everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m49s)

[just build artifacts and this is going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m52s)

[to be the more interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m55s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h19m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m00s)

[what are you complaining about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m02s)

[uh we'll deal with that warning in a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m06s)

[minute](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m10s)

[so I'm curious where this guy is going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m13s)

[this is interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m17s)

[okay well while we wait for that guy to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m22s)

[go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m24s)

[let's go take a look at that brain](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m26s)

[teaser](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m31s)

[as long as people promise not to throw](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m33s)

[things at me they see the answer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m35s)

[okay so here is the lovely little trick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m38s)

[to declaring a Boolean that is neither](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m41s)

[true nor false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m44s)

[so if we come down here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m46s)

[the step one is to abuse unsafe which is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m49s)

[the the c-sharp keyword for allowing you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m54s)

[access to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m57s)

[um unsafe code or unmanaged code or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h20m59s)

[more accurately the ability to use](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m03s)

[pointers and pointer math and do bad](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m05s)

[things that would normally only be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m07s)

[allowed in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m09s)

[um C plus](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m11s)

[so you'll note we start off by just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m12s)

[declaring a Boolean just effectively](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m14s)

[giving ourself uh something that we can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m16s)

[allocate we then get a pointer to the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m19s)

[location of that Boolean because when](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m23s)

[you declare that Boolean it is going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m25s)

[exist in memory somewhere so we grab the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m27s)

[the location of that and then we assign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m31s)

[into that Pointer's location the value](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m33s)

[of 2.](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m36s)

[and then we return that Boolean](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m38s)

[and the problem is is the way true and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m41s)

[false are declared is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m43s)

[in a lot of languages like C plus plus](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m50s)

[false is zero and true is not zero](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m51s)

[that is very different than true being](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m55s)

[one and most people always think of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m57s)

[false being zero and true being one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h21m59s)

[because conceptually that makes a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m01s)

[sense two states zero one were binary](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m03s)

[huzzah everyone works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m05s)

[but it doesn't have to go that way and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m07s)

[you can technically shove a different](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m10s)

[value into your Bool other than true or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m13s)

[false now should you ever do this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m16s)

[no can you do it yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m20s)

[so you you should not bother writing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m25s)

[code that that handles the cases where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m28s)

[your booleans aren't true or false that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m30s)

[is a waste of your time and you should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m31s)

[never do it anyone who does this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m33s)

[probably deserves what they get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m35s)

[um I don't doubt this type of behavior](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m37s)

[has bitten somebody](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m40s)

[um when dealing with some sort of maybe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m42s)

[interrupt or similar where something was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m43s)

[expected to be a Bool but came through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m45s)

[as not a bull but it is it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m47s)

[technically possible to have a Boolean](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m50s)

[that is neither true nor false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m52s)

[so there is the solution to the brain](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m55s)

[teaser if anybody](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h22m59s)

[if anybody finds that interesting so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m00s)

[fancy little unsafe keyword to go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m02s)

[through and do this I was hoping to have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m05s)

[some time to prep this and do it I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m07s)

[I could do it without the unsafe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m10s)

[keyboard](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m11s)

[I I think going in with the Marshall](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m12s)

[class you can get away with it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m14s)

[but I I needed some time to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m17s)

[to play with it and I don't know yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m20s)

[hard is correct I I should have warned](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m22s)

[you it was not necessarily A trivial](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m25s)

[solution because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m27s)

[when you see code that looks like this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m29s)

[you just know that something bad had to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m32s)

[be done to get there if you haven't seen](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m34s)

[my calamities talk](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m36s)

[I I basically do a bunch of really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m38s)

[really bad stuff with C sharp](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m40s)

[this one probably should have made it in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m43s)

[there somehow of I've got a Bool that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m44s)

[neither true nor false and watching](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m47s)

[people scratch their head about wait](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m51s)

[what and you'll note I didn't even have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m52s)

[to disable the warning because X unit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m54s)

[realizes that you're doing something bad](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m57s)

[here and goes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h23m59s)

[like if you turn this off it warns you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m01s)

[and says hey don't use not equal that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m04s)

[a bad idea you should use assert false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m07s)

[well the problem is is this is a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m09s)

[different check](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m12s)

[right I can't do assert false and assert](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m15s)

[true and get this thing to go through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m17s)

[here because this is guaranteed to fail](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m19s)

[right because assert false is going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m21s)

[fail assert true is going to fail](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m23s)

[oh and I guess in that case it does go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m26s)

[through and work I wonder how they're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m28s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m30s)

[true and false](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m31s)

[oh there oh that is interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m33s)

[that is very very interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m39s)

[that is interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m48s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m52s)

[I wonder why that works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h24m54s)

[I wonder why that works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m14s)

[the same problem different approach it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m19s)

[interesting that when I did](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m22s)

[assert true](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m27s)

[this passes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m30s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m33s)

[the only thing that I noticed is that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m34s)

[the assert true for Bool upcast into the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m39s)

[true case for nullable Bool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m44s)

[which up case here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m47s)

[which goes condition has value](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m50s)

[it must be the get value or default](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m53s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h25m58s)

[I wonder okay okay I have a theory that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m01s)

[get value or default](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m06s)

[fixes it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m12s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m14s)

[right that passes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m15s)

[but I bet if I do B get B to uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m18s)

[get value or default](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m21s)

[16. why](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m30s)

[is it because it's still cast as a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m33s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m46s)

[I honestly will probably have to play](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m48s)

[with this I don't fully understand why](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m50s)

[yeah yeah I get it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h26m54s)

[I get it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m00s)

[you're unhappy X unit because I'm now](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m03s)

[doing a boo comparison](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m04s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m10s)

[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m12s)

[interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m14s)

[I will have to play with that at some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m16s)

[point I do plan on publishing out those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m18s)

[brain teasers I'm going to put up a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m20s)

[bunch of stuff in into a repo just to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m21s)

[just to give people some some semblance](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m25s)

[of of fun I think I'll probably move the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m27s)

[solutions onto like a solution Branch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m29s)

[instead that way there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m31s)

[some differences and you don't and it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m33s)

[not as simple as just expand it that way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m36s)

[people don't accidentally see the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m39s)

[solution you have to actually switch to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m40s)

[the solution Branch if you want to find](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m41s)

[it but then everything's in there and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m43s)

[people can see it and play with it and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m45s)

[have all kinds of fun I will warn you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m46s)

[the the brain teasers there's a few of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m49s)

[them that do have some unsafe tricks](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m51s)

[with them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m53s)

[um that can be quite](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m54s)

[entertaining](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m56s)

[okay build artifacts of course she](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h27m58s)

[failed of course you failed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m01s)

[uh right so none of these variables were](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m04s)

[declared so it blew up and died](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m10s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m13s)

[so here I think we can switch branches](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m15s)

[create new branch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m17s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m19s)

[uh new publish release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m23s)

[thanks for the challenge no problem I it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m26s)

[was actually recommended to me and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m28s)

[assuming I prep appropriately I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m30s)

[try to do like little brain teasers at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m33s)

[the where I have my countdown timer at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m36s)

[the beginning of the stream just so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m38s)

[just so there's something mildly more](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m40s)

[entertaining for people to watch than a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m42s)

[simple countdown timer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m44s)

[because I do have I don't know dozen of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m46s)

[them or so that I've saved over the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m49s)

[years it's just sometimes difficult to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m51s)

[condense them into something that fits](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m54s)

[on only like three or four lines that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h28m57s)

[the real hard part is making it making](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m00s)

[it stream prep](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m02s)

[worthy for people so I may end up moving](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m04s)

[some of them to like GitHub gists or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m08s)

[something and then just linking to those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m10s)

[instead that might be easier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m12s)

[uh where was I going here yeah here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m14s)

[repair release okay so this guy here was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m18s)

[relying on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m21s)

[these variables being present they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m23s)

[clearly aren't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m26s)

[um I think we can just go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m28s)

[e and b instead and call it a day](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m31s)

[right because I think those are all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m34s)

[named the same mdix version my apps](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m36s)

[colors version yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m38s)

[I think we can just go e and V on all of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m41s)

[these all that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m43s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m46s)

[yeah so let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h29m50s)

[to do is go here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m04s)

[release and I think I can switch onto my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m07s)

[which I think is the one that I just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m15s)

[pushed to let me just make sure publish](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m17s)

[release oh boy I've got branches](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m43s)

[you're not allowing me to run from a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h30m45s)

[12 minutes ago](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m16s)

[queue up and that's gonna run again](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m20s)

[yeah I get up just as a great idea easy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m23s)

[to connect interesting cases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m25s)

[yeah I do actually have quite a few that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m27s)

[are floating out there that make it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m30s)

[that make it rather interesting I will](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m32s)

[it so if people are interested in seeing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m35s)

[just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m37s)

[because it is probably one of my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m39s)

[favorite things that I ever put together](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m41s)

[this here is potentially one of my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m44s)

[favorite](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m47s)

[brain teasers of all time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m49s)

[so underneath the calamities folder](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m51s)

[there's a program CS](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m53s)

[and I probably should use linked](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m55s)

[straight to it there's a link straight](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m56s)

[to it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h31m59s)

[this program has exactly three lines](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m00s)

[that are sane there are two five and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m04s)

[eight everything else is complete](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m08s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m10s)

[um this I if you fire this program up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m13s)

[and run it I I guarantee you it does not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m15s)

[do what you expect and it is totally](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m19s)

[awesome and Epic](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m24s)

[um just kind of reading through like I I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m26s)

[this was intentionally starting to write](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m28s)

[as obtuse of code as I could possibly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m31s)

[come up with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m34s)

[and I enjoyed every minute of it there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m36s)

[was there was giggling and cackling and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m38s)

[maniacal laughter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m42s)

[it was it was pretty yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m45s)

[it was pretty epic and if you want the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m47s)

[answer of how it works the hint is in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m49s)

[the bad stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m51s)

[and if you go through them in order they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m53s)

[actually it actually kind of starts to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m55s)

[exposing this stuff one step at a time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m56s)

[so and actually if you want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h32m59s)

[uh let me grab the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m02s)

[let's grab this real quick foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m06s)

[let's see so if you want to see the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m28s)

[stream where I actually did the work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m30s)

[building it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m32s)

[this is this is the stream of me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m37s)

[cackling to death putting together the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m39s)

[actual uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m41s)

[stream and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m42s)

[where is the actual](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m46s)

[where's the actual one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m49s)

[I really should save links to some of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m52s)

[these uh oh I think this one is actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m54s)

[buried underneath uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h33m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m01s)

[I think this one's actually buried under](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m04s)

[intellitex if I remember right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m06s)

[videos](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m10s)

[hello good because this one's a little](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m15s)

[older if I remember right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m17s)

[uh GitHub actions essential C sharp](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m19s)

[uh that's really old stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m25s)

[that's too old essential](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m29s)

[all right I know I have it in here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m36s)

[I will have to find it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m39s)

[oh there it is there it is there it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m43s)

[got it got it got it got it yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m45s)

[so there's the one where I actually gave](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m49s)

[the presentation that I prepped](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m51s)

[which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m55s)

[I'm thinking I'm going to go through and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h34m59s)

[do an updated variant of it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m00s)

[or C sharp 11 sometime](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m03s)

[probably in the next six months or so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m06s)

[I don't know if there's gonna be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m08s)

[anywhere where I present it but I may](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m09s)

[just record it post it on YouTube](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m11s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m12s)

[frankly it's a fun talk to give](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m14s)

[I have a lot of fun doing it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m17s)

[Robert welcome aboard](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m19s)

[and today it is actually WPF we are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m22s)

[attempting to automate my my life](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m26s)

[because I am lazy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m28s)

[there's probably other reasons but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m33s)

[that's that's the big one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m35s)

[so with any luck](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m38s)

[this thing runs I probably should have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m41s)

[turned off some of the tests or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m43s)

[something now that we can run from side](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m44s)

[branches so basically the release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m45s)

[process for this library is Big slow and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m48s)

[clunky uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m51s)

[yellow card let's do the streamer for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m54s)

[using prohibited techniques uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h35m57s)

[yeah so I'm trying to make it so that I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m02s)

[have a a single workflow for building](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m05s)

[and Publishing the material design](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m08s)

[Library the problem is there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m10s)

[steps involved in it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m12s)

[and I'm just I it tires me out a lot uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m15s)

[okay while that thing's running](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m20s)

[let's go and look at the other set that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m23s)

[we need to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m25s)

[so the other thing that gets run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m27s)

[as part of release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m31s)

[is down inside this little MD research](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m33s)

[gen](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m36s)

[that is startup project uh do I not have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m37s)

[I didn't save a build configure I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m42s)

[well I thought I had](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m47s)

[oh no that's because this is the wrong](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m49s)

[this is the wrong project hang on I have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m53s)

[a separate tool I run for this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h36m58s)

[where is that call](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m00s)

[sorry I gotta I gotta hunt it down I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m05s)

[think this is actually something I moved](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m07s)

[outside](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m08s)

[uh tab control allow for the opening and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m11s)

[closing easily of tab items like on a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m14s)

[web browser](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m18s)

[not sure what you're referring to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m20s)

[these guys here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m22s)

[I I am using like the control click and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m25s)

[whatnot to shut down my tabs because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m27s)

[muscle memory](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m29s)

[um I have a uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m31s)

[oh your xaml show tab items uh yes that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m36s)

[was an issue we fixed a little earlier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m43s)

[that was a demo app and in the demo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m44s)

[the user was in fact](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m48s)

[wanting to uh they were building out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m51s)

[that tabbed interface and the button](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m54s)

[inside of a tab header was causing grief](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h37m57s)

[so we fixed it okay so this is that this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m01s)

[is this is where the problem is okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m04s)

[I have another repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m07s)

[because uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m11s)

[this GitHub helper repo so if anybody's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m19s)

[interested](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m21s)

[there's the magical repo but this repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m23s)

[does](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m25s)

[hang on I opened it oh it opened an old](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m27s)

[Visual Studio whatever okay but inside](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m30s)

[of here I have a launch settings and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m32s)

[you'll note this is the one that I use](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m35s)

[to do the contributors](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m37s)

[but this guy here also has uh multiple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m40s)

[things that it can do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m45s)

[uh one of its is the contributors it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m47s)

[does some other query stuff for it but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m50s)

[the other thing it does is it will gen](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m52s)

[me up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m54s)

[uh some output](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m55s)

[for what uh icons have changed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h38m58s)

[between version a and version B](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m02s)

[which is highly highly convenient and so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m05s)

[I think what I want to do is migrate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m08s)

[some of this code](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m10s)

[into a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m12s)

[a different spot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m16s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m20s)

[I like what it's doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m23s)

[it's down so what it does is it pulls](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m25s)

[down the the nuget packages](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m27s)

[but I think if I move it so rather than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m32s)

[relying on the nuget packages I think I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m39s)

[uh I think I could do it if I just do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m42s)

[inside the repo and switch and do some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m44s)

[switches brag about the new processor it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m46s)

[is nice I will admit so here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m50s)

[so okay no one left](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m53s)

[okay there it is uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h39m56s)

[so specifically the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m01s)

[stop it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m04s)

[AMD ryzen 7. so I made a small boo-boo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m05s)

[when I did this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m09s)

[uh I had no end of problems getting this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m11s)

[thing in so I've got a a slightly older](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m15s)

[motherboard](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m18s)

[and I I had checked the manufacturer's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m19s)

[site to verify that the processor was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m22s)

[supported the problem is they've got a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m24s)

[table](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m26s)

[of all the processes they support and me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m27s)

[being in a hurry and not paying too](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m30s)

[close attention I only read the first](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m32s)

[couple columns that said yes it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m34s)

[supported the last column turned out to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m35s)

[be kind of important it says by the way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m38s)

[you need the beta version of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m40s)

[firmware in order for it to be supported](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m42s)

[I went](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m44s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m45s)

[so that was a pain in the deck so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m47s)

[spent](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m50s)

[swapping a CPU isn't a terribly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m51s)

[difficult job but I think I spent like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m53s)

[four and a half five hours on it I also](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m55s)

[took it out and back in multiple times](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h40m58s)

[because in my frustrations I ended up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m00s)

[bending a couple of the pins and oh man](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m05s)

[that was I got my magnifying glass out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m09s)

[my tiny little pliers and screwdrivers](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m11s)

[and very carefully straighten the pins](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m14s)

[out oh boy that took yeah so I think I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m16s)

[put the CPU in and out like two or three](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m19s)

[times before it actually worked and yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m21s)

[I did end up having to update the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m24s)

[BIOS in order to get it to work so that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m28s)

[was fun and only because I have an older](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m31s)

[motherboard no other reason](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m34s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m37s)

[all of these things here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m40s)

[because this guy here this just uses a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m44s)

[bunch of reflection to rip through the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m47s)

[the dll](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m50s)

[and pull out all of the in new uh enu](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m52s)

[values from the pack icon](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m55s)

[and then it also does a little bit of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h41m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m02s)

[magic so once it does so does the enum](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m03s)

[parse bit but then it also pulls out the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m05s)

[um the path data string from the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m10s)

[resource dictionary and shoves it into a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m12s)

[hash set as well that way there's some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m15s)

[comparison so I can identify which ones](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m17s)

[have had path changes to the icons as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m20s)

[well so I think I want to migrate this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m24s)

[code out of here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m26s)

[move it into probably that MD resource](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m28s)

[gen one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m32s)

[that way I can have this thing compare](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m33s)

[with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m35s)

[um the previous release to know what the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m38s)

[icon changes are and I think I can get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m39s)

[even more clever](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m42s)

[because we want latest on ours](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m46s)

[so I let's go back here so this thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m51s)

[failed again ah but we're getting closer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m55s)

[we are getting closer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h42m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m00s)

[and I think I want to make sure I do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m01s)

[latest in here because I think what we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m05s)

[can do is we can query the releases get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m07s)

[the prior latest release and that'll](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m09s)

[give us the old version to go against](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m11s)

[uh okay so let's see why this one failed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m14s)

[great release uh uh right so we don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m18s)

[have a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m23s)

[we need this maneuver](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m25s)

[right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m28s)

[see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m30s)

[Rumble Grumble Grumble Grumble Grumble](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m32s)

[Grumble Grumble why a why why why](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m34s)

[my world hates me yada yada yada okay so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m37s)

[we're gonna go set the environment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m41s)

[variable as suggested](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m42s)

[and then we're gonna leave myself a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m45s)

[comment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m46s)

[needed for uh GitHub CLI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m47s)

[we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m52s)

[and I think we kicked this thing off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m55s)

[again](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h43m58s)

[let's confirm that this thing did work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m00s)

[so it should have some artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m02s)

[it does](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m04s)

[rate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m06s)

[I don't think I care about any of this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m10s)

[I don't think I care about any of that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m15s)

[that's all fine](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m17s)

[um I kind of wish it didn't worn on air](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m20s)

[let me look at that real quick because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m23s)

[that is the build and Test action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m25s)

[is there a way on the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m30s)

[upload artifacts to tell it to just shut](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m34s)

[up and not worry about if there's no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m37s)

[files](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m40s)

[because that's the success case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m41s)

[I kind of want it to just not warn me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m45s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m47s)

[uh only just join what are you trying to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m48s)

[do what's the air uh Biz Dev welcome](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m50s)

[smudge so working on automating the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m53s)

[uh the release process for this material](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h44m58s)

[design Library](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m02s)

[so right now doing a release involves a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m04s)

[bunch of manual steps and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m07s)

[put myself out of a job by letting the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m09s)

[GitHub actions do it so the the plan at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m11s)

[the moment so I I guess I should say the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m16s)

[manual steps that that I would like to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m19s)

[automate the building of the artifacts](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m21s)

[that's that was previously done in a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m23s)

[different workflow that's easy great so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m26s)

[like building the demo app building the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m28s)

[nuget packages](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m30s)

[got all that working](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m31s)

[um creating the GitHub release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m33s)

[um updating the content so that it has](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m36s)

[my list of contributors so there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m38s)

[custom action that I built previously](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m40s)

[that gets me that as a string great](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m43s)

[um and then updating uh uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m46s)

[updating it so that it um gens the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m51s)

[release notes for the icon changes uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m55s)

[uh GitHub token isn't a thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h45m58s)

[oh boy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m02s)

[did I did I type the wrong thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m08s)

[if it's not their message is wrong but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m09s)

[let's confirm that uh let's see on text](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m12s)

[uh let's see the GitHub context is the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m19s)

[one we want to look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m23s)

[do do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m32s)

[yeah well I think the issue was uh a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m39s)

[moment ago I didn't actually assign it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m41s)

[anywhere so this I I believe what it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m44s)

[showing me is that I need to actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m47s)

[create this GH token from GitHub token](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m48s)

[um which I believe I have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h46m55s)

[so because I'm using the GitHub CLI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m03s)

[which comes pre-installed on the agents](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m06s)

[that should work and the dollar sign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m09s)

[double curly brace](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m11s)

[correct yeah complain about something](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m15s)

[missing now I had mistakenly assumed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m17s)

[that it would be intelligent enough to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m20s)

[pull it but that was a clearly a bad](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m22s)

[assumption](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m24s)

[the the getup CLI is somewhat Smart in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m26s)

[that if your working directory is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m29s)

[already inside of a GitHub repo it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m30s)

[infers a lot of context from that which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m33s)

[makes life a lot easier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m36s)

[um the one thing I want to do is try to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m39s)

[kill off the there's a warning that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m40s)

[happens when I upload](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m43s)

[um these screenshots so I've got a a UI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m45s)

[test framework that gen screenshots on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m48s)

[any test failure and right now this auto](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m51s)

[upload complains if there are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h47m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m00s)

[if there's no files which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m00s)

[kind of EX like that's the success case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m03s)

[and so I was kind of hoping to see if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m05s)

[there was a option to tell it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m06s)

[don't warn](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m09s)

[oh look at that if no files found air](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m11s)

[warn or ignore what I heard is ignore is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m15s)

[the happy case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m18s)

[so what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m20s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m24s)

[okay so we're gonna do that and once](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m26s)

[again rinse repeat so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m29s)

[uh add in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m32s)

[missing token](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m36s)

[ignoring warnings when no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m39s)

[screenshots present](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m44s)

[stop go away commit push](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m46s)

[uh GitHub release test not the easiest](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m49s)

[thing to search yes uh completely agree](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m51s)

[I actually so I've I've been going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m55s)

[through and doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h48m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m00s)

[just the help docs inside of this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m03s)

[and I found this to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m06s)

[remarkably useful for interacting with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m09s)

[it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m12s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m15s)

[uh if I recre if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m18s)

[let me look I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m21s)

[no this is a go repo I could I couldn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m25s)

[remember if I uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m27s)

[I didn't CLI search helps a lot yeah and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m29s)

[the if you want their their repo they've](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m31s)

[got a bunch of stuff here in terms of uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m35s)

[uh where's the docs section](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m38s)

[uh of stuff in here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m42s)

[uh you added doesn't look present in the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m45s)

[docks](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m48s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m52s)

[not overly surprised I I suspect this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m53s)

[a that air that I saw was a special case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h49m57s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m00s)

[um because it was running inside of a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m03s)

[yeah I'm guessing it's not actually here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m10s)

[I'm guessing it's going to be buried](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m12s)

[underneath](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m14s)

[uh auth or token or similar it's I would](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m16s)

[imagine it's buried in something](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m20s)

[slightly different](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m25s)

[uh GitHub environment I bet you this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m26s)

[where it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m28s)

[yeah this guy here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m36s)

[it's one of those weird things where a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m38s)

[lot of CLI apps when you want to run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m41s)

[them in non-interactive expect](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m43s)

[environment tokens as a way of not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m46s)

[prompting the user because there's that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m48s)

[weird balance between I need to prompt](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m50s)

[the user for something versus](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m54s)

[uh versus I just want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m55s)

[versus I shouldn't prompt because I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h50m59s)

[don't have an interactive terminal uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m01s)

[okay so prepare release we're going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m03s)

[run our workflow again](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m05s)

[and I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m07s)

[I've already forgotten the name of my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m10s)

[Branch publish release](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m12s)

[about that and I want four seven oh and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m15s)

[I've already I've commented out the bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m19s)

[of my workflow that actually publishes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m21s)

[the nuget so that I can just keep](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m23s)

[running this over and over and over](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m24s)

[without like actually sending anything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m25s)

[out the door](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m27s)

[so this is very much in a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m29s)

[I'm gonna beat this into submission](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m32s)

[because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m34s)

[pipeliney action work like this usually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m35s)

[is a string of red followed by one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m38s)

[little tick of green right at the end](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m41s)

[which is always the awesome part](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m43s)

[okay so we're gonna let that go for a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m46s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m48s)

[I do love that this thing is like a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m50s)

[minute and 20. I mean it's hard so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m52s)

[playing catch up ywf and what is it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m55s)

[uh no great questions](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h51m59s)

[um WPF](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m02s)

[because that so I am a WPF Fanboy so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m04s)

[will say that uh it is an old dated](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m07s)

[framework uh and I will admit that like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m10s)

[it's still running xaml version 2006 and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m12s)

[we're in year currently 2022.](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m16s)

[uh so that has been updated in a little](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m19s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m21s)

[um but it is a fairly even though it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m23s)

[dated it does it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m25s)

[stable and there's pros and cons to that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m32s)

[so I they have not dropped WPF though I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m33s)

[think the latest update that I heard](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m38s)

[from their Community standup that they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m40s)

[did is they are pushing it to be more](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m42s)

[Community Driven or something I I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m46s)

[remember the exact phrasing something to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m49s)

[that effect which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m50s)

[is basically a it's in maintenance mode](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m52s)

[style thing which it's kind of been that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m55s)

[way for Years anyway](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h52m59s)

[because they like they haven't really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m01s)

[put a ton of effort into WPF directly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m03s)

[most of the updates that it's gotten in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m06s)

[like the last four years have been](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m08s)

[updates that benefited other things in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m11s)

[addition to WPF so things like high DPI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m13s)

[support uh foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m17s)

[yeah I yeah it was basically the case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m20s)

[already the the WPF team that they had](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m23s)

[was I think one to three people and it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m26s)

[wasn't necessarily like a ton of stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m29s)

[going into it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m31s)

[um did you watch the last cast I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m33s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m35s)

[yeah I think this is the one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m37s)

[um I didn't watch the whole thing but I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m42s)

[was I I got bits and pieces of it I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m44s)

[believe this this this one is the one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m46s)

[where they where they said it though](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m48s)

[but it's basically them just verbalizing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m51s)

[what's already been the case for a long](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m53s)

[time so it's like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m55s)

[some people were really upset it's like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m57s)

[yeah but they they're they're at least](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h53m59s)

[being honest with what what is already](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m01s)

[the case like I can't complain too much](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m03s)

[with them being honest about what's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m05s)

[already there this libraries existed for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m07s)

[a long time though so I'm not the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m10s)

[original creator of it but I took over](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m11s)

[as maintainer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m13s)

[four or five six years ago dang I'm](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m15s)

[feeling I'm starting to feel old](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m20s)

[yeah and I don't watch a lot of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m24s)

[stand-ups I I usually go back and catch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m26s)

[the Recaps when they're when somebody](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m28s)

[tells me there was something interesting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m30s)

[for the exact same reason is my time is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m31s)

[too valuable and there's I don't have an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m34s)

[hour hour and a half to to burn in a lot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m37s)

[of cases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m40s)

[but I took over this library because I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m41s)

[love doing WPF and styling and theming](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m43s)

[um even in my day job uh my current](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m46s)

[project that I'm on is uh working on a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m49s)

[very large uh WPF application so there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m52s)

[still plenty of companies that have a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m56s)

[lot of stuff built in it large portions](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h54m57s)

[of w or Visual Studio are still using](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m00s)

[WPF so uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m03s)

[so it's one of those even though](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m07s)

[Microsoft may have put it in community](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m08s)

[stuff they still haven't migrated their](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m11s)

[stuff off of it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m16s)

[uh so there's not really a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m18s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m22s)

[they so they haven't necessarily killed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m24s)

[it off either](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m27s)

[um but like the updates it's gotten](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m28s)

[recently High DPI support there was a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m29s)

[bunch of stuff for the designer for the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m32s)

[for the xaml designer which a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m34s)

[what they did wasn't just for WPF it was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m36s)

[because their xaml designer sucked and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m40s)

[win UI and uwp also got benefits from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m42s)

[that as well so it was even though they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m45s)

[were fixing the tooling for WPF it was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m47s)

[tooling that was being shared so it was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m49s)

[easier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m51s)

[um to justify it uh yeah just to be with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m52s)

[the question on how is WPF updated](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m55s)

[currently it goes as part of uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h55m57s)

[the framework when it gets distributed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m04s)

[um it is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m06s)

[if you're on old.net framework yes it it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m07s)

[distributes that way but newer stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m12s)

[since netcore three one and net five net](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m14s)

[six and now net 7.](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m16s)

[um it comes in the box with the those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m18s)

[Frameworks you typically just install](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m21s)

[the extra workload for uh visual studio](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m23s)

[for desktop development and you get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m26s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m28s)

[um but then updates to it will go out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m30s)

[with like if there's a security patch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m32s)

[that needs to go out for it it'll go out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m34s)

[with the same security patches that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m36s)

[would go out for like other Net 7 stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m38s)

[um you can however](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m41s)

[uh with net](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m43s)

[can't remember if you could do it net](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m45s)

[six you can do it net seven](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m47s)

[um WPF picked because WPF is running on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m49s)

[the latest](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m52s)

[um.net Frameworks still because that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m54s)

[the thing even though WPF as a framework](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m56s)

[Maybe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h56m59s)

[um in community support it still is able](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m01s)

[to leverage all of the new.net stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m04s)

[that comes out so you still get all of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m06s)

[the new.net features in WPF without](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m08s)

[really needing to do anything which is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m10s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m14s)

[yeah yeah and that's that's absolutely](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m17s)

[correct the WPF updates in Net 7 were](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m20s)

[like tiny uh but yeah WPF runs on net 7.](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m23s)

[um I think this library is actually I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m28s)

[believe I added Net 7 support to it it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m29s)

[fairly simple you can do single XC](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m31s)

[deployments](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m34s)

[um aot if you want if you really want to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m36s)

[try and go down that route](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m41s)

[uh if it is not possible installing that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m43s)

[seven will the computer receive WPF if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m46s)

[net 4 8 it's installed there so yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m48s)

[so.net framework for eight is not out of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m50s)

[support uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m55s)

[uh so the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m57s)

[trying to remember](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h57m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m01s)

[yeah so oh and actually I guess four](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m04s)

[seven](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m07s)

[hasn't reached end of life either I that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m09s)

[that would surprise me I thought four](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m12s)

[eight or I thought four eight was the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m13s)

[only current one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m15s)

[um so any so if you've got a WPF app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m16s)

[targeting NET Framework for eight](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m19s)

[security updates for WPF will go out via](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m21s)

[Windows update with the regular channels](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m24s)

[to update the the framework it's usually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m26s)

[less about a vulnerability in WPF and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m29s)

[more about if there are security updates](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m32s)

[or similar things for the framework and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m33s)

[WPF just kind of tags along for the ride](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m40s)

[so this Library mostly uh reverse](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m40s)

[compatibility for wpfs there or per](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m43s)

[reference over uwp or in Maui so this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m46s)

[Library came about because the default](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m49s)

[styling in WPF](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m51s)

[um I'll say it nicely is crap](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m54s)

[uh it's it's just pretty enough that a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h58m57s)

[lot of people don't change the defaults](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m01s)

[and so the idea here is a theming](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m02s)

[library for WPF that follows Google's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m06s)

[material design so that you can look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m08s)

[it now some people hate that immediately](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m11s)

[because they go that's Google's design](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m13s)

[Paradigm why are you putting that on my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m15s)

[windows box back off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m16s)

[and sure find if if that's the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m19s)

[perspective go for it some people really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m21s)

[like the fluent design that came out in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m23s)

[like the uh I think it came out either](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m26s)

[end of uwp early win UI when you I2](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m28s)

[range](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m32s)

[in that vicinity](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m34s)

[um with their fluent design stuff which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m36s)

[is what a lot of things flow towards and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m37s)

[so people see the material design stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m39s)

[and they go icky it's like well yeah but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m41s)

[I would take this look over uh default](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m44s)

[WPF most days of the week](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m48s)

[so it so you could say that it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m51s)

[reversing compatibility I would say it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m54s)

[just putting it's giving an alternate](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m57s)

[theming option out there there's there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=01h59m59s)

[lots of other theming libraries WPF devs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m01s)

[can choose from like if you want to go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m03s)

[commercial there's things like teleric](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m05s)

[that come with I don't know 16 built-in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m06s)

[themes that you can toggle and do all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m09s)

[kinds of stuff with which is great sure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m11s)

[if you want to go that route](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m13s)

[um you're welcome to there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m16s)

[I think this is one of the few WPF](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m18s)

[theming libraries that still actively](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m21s)

[maintained and isn't commercial I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m23s)

[this and Ma apps are the only](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m25s)

[um they're the biggest ones out there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m30s)

[so it's it's one of the top two uh I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m33s)

[definitely like the idea of personally](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m35s)

[WPA he was almost dated as soon as it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m36s)

[released let alone now](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m42s)

[yeah and the the naming in here so it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m45s)

[Google through a curveball when they uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m48s)

[did material design three](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m51s)

[um because material design two there was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m53s)

[technically multiple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m56s)

[points where they changed or added](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h00m58s)

[things to it but there wasn't actual](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m00s)

[releases and there wasn't like versiony](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m03s)

[where you could see the old stuff so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m05s)

[there was a couple times where like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m06s)

[naming got changed and this Library had](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m08s)

[followed the naming](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m10s)

[up until it got changed it was like wait](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m11s)

[what you ah you can't just rename stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m13s)

[on us like that's a breaking change for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m16s)

[us to rename things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m18s)

[um so there is we've started going](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m20s)

[through with like the material design](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m23s)

[three adding that uh in with support as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m25s)

[well so if people want to use some of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m28s)

[the new material design three stuff both](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m30s)

[are in the Box you can mix and match if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m32s)

[you want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m34s)

[it depends on what you're building some](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m35s)

[apps like to bring in and do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m37s)

[and let the this Library kind of Drive](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m40s)

[the theming so you get a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m43s)

[right out of the gate just with the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m45s)

[getting started](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m47s)

[um but like the project that I'm on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m49s)

[um during my day job](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m51s)

[we've got like a dedicated designer and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m53s)

[the the company's got this whole design](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m57s)

[language they've put together and not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h01m59s)

[everybody has that going for them so we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m01s)

[don't let this Library drive but we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m03s)

[leverage it because there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m06s)

[useful stuff in here uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m08s)

[December uh let's see what is that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m11s)

[uh I think you should just make the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m14s)

[breaking name changes if people pick a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m16s)

[UI Tech based on web Stacks they have to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m18s)

[expect webtext pacing in my opinion yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m20s)

[and I I try to balance there's a there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m22s)

[a balancing act here too because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m24s)

[semver's definition of breaking change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m26s)

[like in C sharp it's already kind of a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m28s)

[little ambiguous of whether we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m31s)

[talking Source level breaking or binary](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m33s)

[breaking change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m35s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m37s)

[with this Library there's also the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m38s)

[concept of visual breaking change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m40s)

[because I can technically if we say like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m43s)

[Source level compatibility I can make](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m46s)

[changes that are private that probably](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m49s)

[aren't breaking but then some people](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m53s)

[would go well you change that behavior](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m54s)

[that's a major breaking change for me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m56s)

[okay great I get like so there's there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h02m58s)

[a bit of a balancing act there there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m01s)

[few places where I've just straight up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m02s)

[said you know what even if it's not a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m04s)

[major version rev we're doing we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m07s)

[doing breaking changes like for example](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m09s)

[the icons in this Library I've got a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m10s)

[nightly process that that pulls updates](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m13s)

[for them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m15s)

[and so I've just straight up said there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m16s)

[may be breaking icon changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m19s)

[and my compromise is I'll document them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m21s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m24s)

[um so for example](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m27s)

[this year like I I will straight up list](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m28s)

[here's all the new icons and there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m31s)

[apparently a bunch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m34s)

[um here's all the ones where there was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m36s)

[some sort of visual change to the icon](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m38s)

[and then here's the ones that are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m41s)

[straight up removed that there just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m43s)

[isn't a a change for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m48s)

[is a minor increment ultimately so as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m50s)

[long as you're consistent the consumer](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m52s)

[gets to choose which changes they update](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m54s)

[to yeah and I I try to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m55s)

[fairly consistent there we don't do a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h03m58s)

[lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m01s)

[uh trying to remember the December](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m03s)

[terminology for the third digit the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m05s)

[bug fix version ones there's not a ton](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m07s)

[of those that go in because it's really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m10s)

[hard for me to most of the changes in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m12s)

[here aren't that Minor A lot of times](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m15s)

[there's new it's very consistent that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m18s)

[there's feature requests or visual](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m21s)

[changes or stuff going in so most of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m23s)

[releases tend to be minor version or](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m26s)

[major version revs like we we did do a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m30s)

[four six one but there was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m32s)

[you'll note that it it went from 460-461](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m35s)

[and then what will be a four seven and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m41s)

[then the previous one I think was yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m43s)

[four five so it's mostly minor version](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m45s)

[yeah patch thank you it's mostly the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m47s)

[patch ones that we I don't do a ton of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m50s)

[because usually I've got a a queue of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m53s)

[PR's of new stuff coming in so most](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m55s)

[releases are gonna get some set of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h04m58s)

[features and whatnot bundled into the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m00s)

[mix oh look at that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m02s)

[we got back to our failure](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m05s)

[uh stat nougat no such file or directory](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m07s)

[well what did I do wrong](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m11s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m19s)

[uh that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m21s)

[what did I do wrong here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m28s)

[I wonder can I yes I can rerun failed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m35s)

[jobs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m38s)

[the problem is I what I really want to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m39s)

[do is Rerun failed jobs with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m41s)

[updated yaml because I'm trying to see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m46s)

[what the heck I did wrong](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m48s)

[the download appeared to download to the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m52s)

[directory I'm guessing I need to specify](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m56s)

[not SL oh that's why it's because I'm on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h05m58s)

[a Unix system and slash is going to root](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m02s)

[the file path](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m04s)

[that's what it is I can't do slash at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m06s)

[the beginning because that thinks it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m09s)

[root of the file path slash and you go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m10s)

[okay then blah blah blah blah blah I'm a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m12s)

[[ __ ] okay I'm a [ __ ]](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m18s)

[I guess we could actually we could do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m23s)

[right and go go all the way to the root](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m25s)

[that would work because there's a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m31s)

[GitHub uh I have the contacts open](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m34s)

[though yeah get up workspace so I could](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m37s)

[do this and just fully root the thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m40s)

[uh yeah let's do that rather than doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m45s)

[relative file paths we'll just we can we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m48s)

[can fully qualify it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m50s)

[yeah default working directory on the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m56s)

[runner for steps and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h06m59s)

[and default action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m01s)

[which should be fine this one here isn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m03s)

[doing a checkout](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m06s)

[so I don't technically have anything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m08s)

[like it should be empty aside from what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m10s)

[gets downloaded here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m12s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m15s)

[get some file paths okay great uh we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m17s)

[probably going to end up doing a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m21s)

[checkout though here in a minute](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m23s)

[um because I would like to get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m25s)

[hair release on workflow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m29s)

[this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m52s)

[I don't I think it's going to cause a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m54s)

[problem when it goes to publish](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h07m58s)

[um okay so that'll once again take a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m01s)

[minute to run](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m04s)

[the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m12s)

[this pack icon diff tool migrated into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m14s)

[the repo so that I can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m18s)

[run it and this is doing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m21s)

[wacky stuff where it downloads with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m24s)

[nuget exe and then does reflection into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m25s)

[the assembly and yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m28s)

[I think there's a much simpler approach](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m31s)

[I think there is a much simpler approach](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m36s)

[because if we run this inside of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m39s)

[Repository](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m41s)

[we can just straight up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m43s)

[go and get it no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m46s)

[let me look because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m49s)

[the.net nuget command](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m54s)

[does have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h08m57s)

[yeah I'd have to do magic if I wanted to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m04s)

[do that I think it's just as simple](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m07s)

[I think it's just as safe for me to use](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m10s)

[the tag on the repo to find the version](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m12s)

[as it is to use that same version to go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m14s)

[to nuget](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m17s)

[I can't think of a reason why those](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m19s)

[would be out of sync](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m21s)

[they shouldn't ever be out of sync](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m25s)

[unless I've made a mistake somewhere](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m49s)

[I think that's I think what I probably](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m51s)

[want to do is inside of this resource](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m53s)

[gen thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m57s)

[which is basically our](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h09m58s)

[our little catch-all CLI to do all the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m02s)

[things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m06s)

[at some point I really want to update it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m08s)

[to use the system command line Library](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m10s)

[uh let's see nuget EXE](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m13s)

[is much better than it used to be what's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m17s)

[your tooling doing now so and I think I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m19s)

[think I shared this link Before You](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m22s)

[Dropped In so let me grab it again real](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m23s)

[quick so this is the this is the repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m27s)

[so this is one that I I basically have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m28s)

[thrown just a bunch of git hubby stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m31s)

[into that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m34s)

[I use for various things](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m37s)

[um in this case it's the diff icons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m40s)

[method that I'm actually interested in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m42s)

[converting over](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m45s)

[um so it downloads two nuget packages](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m47s)

[a the current version and the previous](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m50s)

[version](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m54s)

[it extracts their contents and then does](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m55s)

[this process dll thing which then does](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h10m58s)

[reflection](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m01s)

[to pull out the the dll that contains](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m03s)

[all of the icons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m06s)

[um and it's actually what is responsible](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m08s)

[for that documentation page that I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m10s)

[showed just a second ago where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m13s)

[we show all these pack icon changes so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m16s)

[don't write this that's way too much](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m20s)

[work uh dear Heavens I would never](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m22s)

[survive](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m24s)

[but I the output of that diff icons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m25s)

[method is this content](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m29s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m32s)

[ideally what I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m33s)

[is this pipeline to gen me that content](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m35s)

[because I don't want to think that hard](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m38s)

[about it I I kind of want to say when I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m40s)

[run this Pipeline and I say give me a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m43s)

[release you know fix the contributors](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m45s)

[build the artifacts build me the GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m48s)

[release attach all the things set the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m50s)

[content do the icon diff update](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m53s)

[documentation that way I don't have to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m56s)

[do any of it because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h11m58s)

[I forget stuff and things go wrong and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m00s)

[my world ends](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m02s)

[um but the whole point of doing all of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m04s)

[this reflection stuff is just to go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m06s)

[after this enum this pack icon kind](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m12s)

[uh the correct way to do that would be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m15s)

[with an MS build test yeah we can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m16s)

[I see the for this little bit here I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m20s)

[think what I'm really interested in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m23s)

[doing though is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m24s)

[just is pulling this back out because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m29s)

[the only thing that this cares about is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m32s)

[extracting the the enum values and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m35s)

[the the vector data for it so like and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m40s)

[then hopefully Visual Studio gets to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m43s)

[gets the test it gets to be tested a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m46s)

[little bit so for example uh the pack](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m48s)

[icon kind this enum here you can see my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m51s)

[scroll bar](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m55s)

[is a big](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m56s)

[and points to visual studio so somewhere](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h12m58s)

[around line](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m00s)

[thirteen thousand two hundred and eighty](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m02s)

[seven](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m04s)

[uh because it again this is this guy's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m05s)

[Auto generated](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m08s)

[um she builds that up and then this guy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m10s)

[here is also Auto generated you'll note](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m13s)

[this is just a dictionary](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m16s)

[but this dictionary here has all the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m18s)

[stuff in it effectively all of the path](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m22s)

[data](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m24s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m33s)

[yes so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m35s)

[um yeah I think the the way I would say](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m37s)

[it is I'm wanting to know when I do a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m40s)

[release of the material design themes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m43s)

[Library](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m45s)

[what pack icon changes have occurred](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m47s)

[and the only reason it's mildly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m51s)

[complicated is because there's an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m52s)

[automated process that's do that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m55s)

[updating them](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m57s)

[and so I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h13m59s)

[guess that's another thought is rather](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m01s)

[than doing it at the end](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m03s)

[I could look at the automated process](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m06s)

[that's Jenning it and try to do it there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m08s)

[and just keep a rolling update](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m12s)

[that's an interesting thought](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m17s)

[so going back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m20s)

[so the the thing that's actually doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m25s)

[the work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m27s)

[for that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m28s)

[uh if it can output changes oh well it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m31s)

[certainly can because I wrote it so it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m35s)

[do it it's basically just a handful of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m38s)

[steps so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m40s)

[do a checkout setup.net and then invoke](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m42s)

[that MD resource gen thing uh passing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m46s)

[the icon switch so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m49s)

[that the tool that's doing the Jenning](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m52s)

[is this guy here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m54s)

[it calls main it passes icons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h14m56s)

[which does icon thing run async](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m00s)

[so this guy certainly could do more](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m04s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m06s)

[you certainly could do more stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m08s)

[so he just grabs the template and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m13s)

[rips through adding everything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m16s)

[and it gets mildly it gets mildly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m20s)

[interesting like it is going against](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m25s)

[the materialdesign icons.com in order to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m26s)

[pull down the source data like this this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m29s)

[is where it comes from so even though I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m32s)

[may run on a nightly process they update](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m35s)

[I don't know every so often usually I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m38s)

[see two or three updates every single](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m41s)

[a week go through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m45s)

[but this guy could gen because he knows](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m49s)

[the old version and the new version of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m53s)

[the file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m55s)

[he could gen the differences](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h15m56s)

[and he could add those to the wiki](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m00s)

[that's the other thing is it's the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m05s)

[data needs to end up in the wiki but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m07s)

[but but but there is no reason that this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m12s)

[couldn't be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m15s)

[put together](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m17s)

[at a minimum](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m22s)

[yeah it should be config it's one of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m31s)

[those it hasn't changed in years I am](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m34s)

[only mildly responsible for this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m36s)

[I've updated it plenty of times](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m39s)

[there's a lot of things inside of this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m43s)

[little resource gen project I that need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m45s)

[to go through and be updated I haven't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m48s)

[updated it for a lot of the Net 7 stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m50s)

[Beyond doing it the HTTP client there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m53s)

[there's plenty of interesting bits in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h16m59s)

[uh yeah I am wondering though that is a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m02s)

[much more interesting Prospect of just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m05s)

[having this thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m09s)

[keep the running list and he doesn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m12s)

[actually even need to publish it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m14s)

[I'm kind of thinking that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m17s)

[he could just tack in to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m22s)

[text file artifacts that get published](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m26s)

[that might even be easier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m29s)

[because if he runs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m33s)

[take this through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m35s)

[let's think this through](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m38s)

[if he runs and goes through and does all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m43s)

[of this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m45s)

[right now it's not reading the current](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m48s)

[file but that could change](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m50s)

[if he were to read the current file to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m53s)

[know the current set of icons and the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m55s)

[current set of path data](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h17m57s)

[he could then do the same diffing bit to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m01s)

[figure out the ads or moves and changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m03s)

[that's not terribly difficult it's like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m05s)

[my older algorithm isn't doing anything](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m07s)

[Advanced it's just using hash sets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m09s)

[once it knows those changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m13s)

[right now it's opening up a pull request](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m18s)

[but I'm kind of thinking that that might](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m21s)

[need to just go away in favor of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m23s)

[straight up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m26s)

[straight up pushing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m29s)

[um and the only reason I say that is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m32s)

[this pull request when you create a pull](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m34s)

[request via a action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m36s)

[and maybe I should try doing this with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m42s)

[the CLI instead uh when you do it with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m44s)

[an action it can't it doesn't trigger](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m47s)

[the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m50s)

[um the pr verification workflow which is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m51s)

[really annoying because I would really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m54s)

[prefer it to go through the pr](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m56s)

[verification workflow how so I've just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h18m57s)

[been Auto merging it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m00s)

[but there's no reason](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m07s)

[let's let's take a look at that oh our](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m09s)

[other one failed what'd you feel on this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m12s)

[time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m14s)

[wait what oh not a git reposit uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m20s)

[oh it definitely should curious that it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m26s)

[doesn't kick that workflow off sounds](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m28s)

[like a GitHub bug](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m29s)

[um it's actually documented behavior and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m31s)

[I'm trying to remember where it is so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m34s)

[get a GitHub action can't chain into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m36s)

[another GitHub action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m39s)

[so the and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m43s)

[uh there there should be a big asterisk](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m46s)

[next to that because there are certain](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m49s)

[rules so in general an action can't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m51s)

[cause another action so you don't ever](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m53s)

[get into that infinite spiral Loop where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m55s)

[action a does something that triggers](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m57s)

[action b b triggers a and round and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h19m59s)

[round round you go so you never get into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m01s)

[that situation with actions however](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m04s)

[there are ways around that because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m06s)

[GitHub can't always know when it's an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m08s)

[action triggering another one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m12s)

[um and so different things with like web](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m15s)

[hooks or manual invocations you can you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m17s)

[can definitely Force the kicks but by](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m20s)

[default an action won't trigger another](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m23s)

[action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m24s)

[but yeah it is it is mildly obnoxious](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m27s)

[behavior](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m32s)

[yeah there should be some kind of a b](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m33s)

[constru ain't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m34s)

[yeah I yeah I agree it's it's the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m37s)

[standard algorithm that you get asked in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m39s)

[interview questions of given a graph](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m41s)

[right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m43s)

[uh figure out if there's any cycles and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m45s)

[I I guess the hard part though too is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m47s)

[knowing if there's going to be Cycles](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m49s)

[gets really difficult once you start](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m52s)

[adding in like conditionals and whatnot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h20m58s)

[okay so this thing doesn't know that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m00s)

[it's a GitHub repository](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m02s)

[mostly because I fired this thing off](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m07s)

[and didn't do any sort of checkout](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m09s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m14s)

[so there's two options with the GitHub](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m16s)

[CLI you can either tell it what the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m18s)

[repository is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m20s)

[or you can go through and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m21s)

[um do the checkout I think in this case](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m25s)

[I actually want to do the checkout](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m28s)

[only because if we update the tool](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m31s)

[I guess I'm not guaranteed to need it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m36s)

[I'm not guaranteed to need it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m40s)

[so let's do this uh uh release let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m44s)

[just specify it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m49s)

[I think it was like Dash r](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m51s)

[yeah that we'll do dash dash repost so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m54s)

[it's owner slash repo and I believe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m57s)

[there's something on my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h21m59s)

[context for that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m03s)

[because I believe you know about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m06s)

[yourself](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m09s)

[uh uh is there a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m11s)

[GitHub step Secrets Matrix no It's gotta](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m16s)

[be the GitHub context](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m20s)

[and there is got to be a it's like an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m23s)

[owner or repo or something in here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m27s)

[the owner repository name hey look at](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m30s)

[that that thing right there gimme](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m33s)

[oh and I need to stop minimizing and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m36s)

[remember that I'm changing tabs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m39s)

[uh let's do that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m42s)

[and then I want to do that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m45s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m50s)

[okay and once again uh specifying](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m51s)

[repo of the CLI](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h22m58s)

[stop it commit push](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m02s)

[and then we will go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m06s)

[back](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m09s)

[we will go prepare release and we will](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m11s)

[go run and we will tell you to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m13s)

[publish](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m17s)

[we will do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m18s)

[4.7.0 and run workflow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m20s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m25s)

[there you go and we let that let that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m29s)

[run okay so back to the idea of this guy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m32s)

[running](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m36s)

[so if he does the diff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m37s)

[and he's run on a nightly process](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m40s)

[rather than him opening up a PR because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m44s)

[I don't think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m48s)

[I don't know if that's over I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m51s)

[think this is actually overly valuable](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m52s)

[it's uh don't forget to delete the test](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h23m56s)

[release oh thank you I think it didn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m00s)

[get created this time but uh we will](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m03s)

[double check](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m04s)

[still good for the moment](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m10s)

[if rather than](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m14s)

[rather than going through and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m18s)

[creating it if it just pushed in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m22s)

[there is no reason it couldn't just push](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m26s)

[in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m29s)

[some extra artifact that contained the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m31s)

[data](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m33s)

[that would be convenient the other thing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m39s)

[part of the reason why I kind of want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m41s)

[the running set of data](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m43s)

[guess do I care I'm just worried so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m47s)

[there's been a number of times where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m50s)

[I've seen the material design icons](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m51s)

[where there's a change and then it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m54s)

[reverted](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m56s)

[do I care about that in my release notes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h24m58s)

[I don't know if I do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m03s)

[don't know if I do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m06s)

[unitedly would be created a dear diff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m10s)

[per night run so this boy would then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m13s)

[need to collate those changes that's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m15s)

[what I'm thinking is I'm thinking that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m17s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m20s)

[I'm thinking that there is almost like a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m26s)

[pack icon current release notes changes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m29s)

[dot text file or something](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m32s)

[that he's going to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m35s)

[read and effectively append to or edit](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m39s)

[and it probably should be like a Json](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m44s)

[file or something to make my life easier](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m46s)

[and then when we get around to this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m51s)

[release trigger all it has to do is pick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m53s)

[that up a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m57s)

[because if if that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h25m59s)

[if that Json file exists when we kick](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m01s)

[off this release process it will run it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m05s)

[will be able to pull that file down](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m09s)

[because I think as part of the build](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m13s)

[steps](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m15s)

[what I would end up doing is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m16s)

[in here when it's building the nugets](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m19s)

[and everything else I think I would just](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m22s)

[add another upload artifact where it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m24s)

[uploads that Json file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m26s)

[this guy would then download said Json](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m28s)

[file and do the needful with it to to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m31s)

[build it up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m34s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m36s)

[and potentially unreleased you'd PR last](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m38s)

[time we released date change yeah I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m40s)

[think that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m43s)

[I think that works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m44s)

[I think that works](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m47s)

[so then I guess](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m50s)

[we start cleaning up this resource gen](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m52s)

[tool a little bit and doing it here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m55s)

[I think that's the path of least](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h26m59s)

[resistance okay so step one we're gonna](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m00s)

[we're gonna file scope namespace some of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m04s)

[these things and clean some of this up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m06s)

[um because this tool was was initially](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m10s)

[meant to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m13s)

[um just run locally](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m15s)

[wasn't necessarily designed I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m18s)

[think this has any](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m20s)

[I don't think there's any major problems](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m24s)

[with it but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m26s)

[wait what is this for Loop doing get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m28s)

[current directory](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m30s)

[uh loop while get directory name is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m33s)

[failed to find file path oh so it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m44s)

[going on a a hunting spree for the file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m48s)

[up to the directory structure got it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m50s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m53s)

[so it goes a walking until it finds it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m54s)

[and then it writes it in okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m57s)

[okay so without changing too much of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h27m59s)

[this because this is going to bother me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m01s)

[uh we are going to clean up some of this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m05s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m07s)

[and I don't really want to touch all the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m09s)

[Roslyn stuff because every time I touch](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m11s)

[it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m13s)

[Brian doesn't find the file by looking](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m14s)

[for a dot but you can have dots in the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m16s)

[folder path](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m17s)

[oh is that what it was doing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m21s)

[oh this is get full path by the DOT](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m27s)

[so this will grab from uh current](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m30s)

[directory and convert the relative path](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m33s)

[dot into fully qualified path](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m37s)

[but then it hunts the path by combining](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m42s)

[that directory with the file name that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m44s)

[it's yeah no I I started this for Loop](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m46s)

[for a second too going what the heck](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m49s)

[the worst part is I may have written](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m52s)

[this this screams of something that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m54s)

[previous Kevin would have done](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m56s)

[the this feels okay and this feels like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h28m59s)

[this really should be air right line](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m04s)

[like we kind of want to not](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m08s)

[be that okay so we're gonna avoid](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m11s)

[touching that and we're gonna avoid](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m13s)

[touching that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m14s)

[okay so let's start here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m16s)

[let's just walk through this so get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m22s)

[Source data it does so it parses this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m23s)

[this gives me a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m26s)

[let's just convert you use explicit type](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m30s)

[please so this icon class is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m32s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m37s)

[this is something very simple this is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m42s)

[just everything that got parsed out of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m44s)

[the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m47s)

[uh downloaded data from here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m49s)

[so it just does all of the parse parsing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m52s)

[there's some weird stuff to deal with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m56s)

[naming of it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h29m57s)

[because the naming on material design](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m00s)

[icons is slightly different than what we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m02s)

[want in C sharp](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m05s)

[and does all of the needful](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m07s)

[because apparently we've seen dupes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m10s)

[before that's exciting](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m12s)

[and then clean up aliases because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h30m15s)

[artifact that I'm trying to upload are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m23s)

[the the output of a bin directory come](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m26s)

[on open oh you are open just on a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m28s)

[different thing so I actually do want a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m31s)

[zip file that contains the the demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m33s)

[in a variety of Frameworks so that when](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m37s)

[somebody downloads it they can decide](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m39s)

[which way they want to run it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m40s)

[so in an ideal situation I I actually do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m46s)

[want to keep the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m49s)

[the compressed archive](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m52s)

[uh well the bit it's complaining about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m54s)

[isn't a zip file it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h41m56s)

[uh expects to be a zip](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m00s)

[um but if I do a dash F my concern there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m05s)

[is it's going to treat it as the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m08s)

[uh the notes file](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m12s)

[and I don't actually want to pass up the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m14s)

[release notes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m17s)

[at least not yet I just want to attach](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m19s)

[it as an additional artifact](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m25s)

[but you are correct it is squawking on](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m30s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m35s)

[see you Justin Bieber](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m38s)

[which is why I'm thinking that the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m43s)

[simplest thing might just be to zip up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m45s)

[all of the contents uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m47s)

[uh our hands](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m51s)

[is your main terminal app I think you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m54s)

[get the process uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m56s)

[that is a good question](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h42m59s)

[oh no it's worse than that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m08s)

[uh uh so I recently installed a new CPU](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m12s)

[which required updating my](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m16s)

[bios and apparently virtualization is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m19s)

[not enabled in my BIOS anymore lovely](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m23s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m28s)

[I need to do that but that requires](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m29s)

[that will require uh stopping the stream](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m32s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m36s)

[not exactly a great idea](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m37s)

[um I think what I can do though is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m40s)

[something akin to this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m43s)

[so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m45s)

[I think I think and I don't think often](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m47s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m51s)

[uh let's see name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m53s)

[zip demo app let's do a run command](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h43m57s)

[and then we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m03s)

[uh let's see demo app dot zip and I want](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m07s)

[you to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m11s)

[demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m12s)

[I'm understanding this correctly that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m15s)

[I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m25s)

[wish it had defined what the dash R was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m27s)

[but maybe I'm missing it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m29s)

[we're gonna just try it and see what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m31s)

[happens uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m34s)

[r](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m38s)

[hope for the best](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m40s)

[I think that matches](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m43s)

[I don't really care about specifying](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m50s)

[compression](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m52s)

[and I'm kind of wondering if I even need](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h44m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m00s)

[uh oh fire locks thanks for the follow](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m04s)

[appreciate it uh I think the download](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m05s)

[contained in the release article](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m13s)

[is your dash our repo parameter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m15s)

[uh let me look](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m21s)

[ah so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m29s)

[because the final parameters is just the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m34s)

[release notes in your team](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m37s)

[yeah so we'll get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m39s)

[oh we need to put](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m44s)

[um we need to change this guy up uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m46s)

[let's see demo app](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m49s)

[in theory this should become](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m52s)

[demo app dot zip if the above command is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m56s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h45m59s)

[that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m04s)

[uh it attaches your dash dash repo as a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m07s)

[zip to the release and then final](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m11s)

[parameter or is it just notes or maybe](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m12s)

[I've misunderstood so I don't so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m15s)

[generate release notes I think is a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m16s)

[standalone option from their docs here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m19s)

[and I believe if I if I understood](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m25s)

[correctly the the syntax is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m28s)

[uh command command command various so it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m32s)

[bothers me that they call it tag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m37s)

[and then files and then Flags is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m39s)

[something apparently that they didn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m42s)

[bother to think that needed to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m43s)

[included in usage but down here they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m45s)

[show various things where it's here's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m47s)

[the tag that I want to use for the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m50s)

[release followed by my options](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m52s)

[and then here's where they show](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m55s)

[attaching the the files](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h46m58s)

[uh which you're providing via](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m02s)

[those command options is the files which](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m07s)

[you're providing via the dash dash repo](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m10s)

[it's not my dash dash repo with here](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m15s)

[I'll buy those themselves we should](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m18s)

[provide](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m19s)

[the end of your args so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m20s)

[my limited understanding](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m23s)

[having not gotten this to work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m26s)

[successfully yet is that the files had](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m27s)

[to come after all of the options but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m30s)

[they don't have](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m32s)

[I don't think they have an exit yeah](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m35s)

[they don't have an example in here that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m37s)

[includes both the file paths as well as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m38s)

[combining with other flags](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m42s)

[which feels like an oversight](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m46s)

[that they don't include the flags in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m48s)

[their usage](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m51s)

[and they don't have a sample showing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m53s)

[Flags plus files I only put files at the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m55s)

[end because I assume that there needed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h47m58s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m01s)

[last yes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m03s)

[I completely believe that that they're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m06s)

[that they're crap I've got a colleague](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m09s)

[and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m12s)

[she has a knack for finding all of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m13s)

[weird edge cases of the docs don't cover](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m15s)

[this and I I'm not entirely sure what to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m18s)

[do anymore it's like oh boy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m21s)

[oh boy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m26s)

[yeah so I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m27s)

[yeah full send we'll see what happens](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m32s)

[um okay let's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m35s)

[clear up some of these things so I don't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m36s)

[have to look at them uh let's see](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m38s)

[prepare release run workflow and then](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m40s)

[publish release and then we're gonna go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m44s)

[with 4.7.0](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m47s)

[we'll send we'll see how how many rows](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m51s)

[of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m54s)

[zeros uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m55s)

[if you provide dash dash repo is that an](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h48m59s)

[optional file is that an additional](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m01s)

[options](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m04s)

[oh yeah yeah you're correct I am reading](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m08s)

[I am reading it as the latter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m14s)

[that is a good question because I had](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m17s)

[read it as uh as this is another](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m20s)

[flag](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m24s)

[or what I would have called an option](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m26s)

[with an argument](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m28s)

[and mine in theory should be option](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m30s)

[argument and it's not clear to me where](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m34s)

[it goes I think it needs I think all of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m37s)

[the the the dash dash Flags or options](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m40s)

[however we want to call them I think are](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m43s)

[supposed to go between the tag and the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m46s)

[files](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m48s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m51s)

[but I have I have nothing to base that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m52s)

[one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m55s)

[I have absolutely nothing to base that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h49m59s)

[on I suppose the actual](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m01s)

[would seems special like it was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m04s)

[something that applied to the whole](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m06s)

[command yeah depending on how it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m07s)

[interpreted so I I took it from the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m10s)

[perspective uh so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m14s)

[Okay small tangent small tangent uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m16s)

[uh there's a wonderful Library so if you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m20s)

[do any command linework in.net highly](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m22s)

[recommend this Library](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m24s)

[I'm biased I contribute to it I think](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m26s)

[it's awesome](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m31s)

[but inside of here there is I think we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m33s)

[have a good Docs](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m39s)

[um where is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m40s)

[history](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m44s)

[one of these things had a breakdown of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m48s)

[where is the of the terminology](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m55s)

[oh that's right we moved it into the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h50m59s)

[actual real docs I forgot about this uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m01s)

[command line syntax](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m04s)

[I view that uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m06s)

[really](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m12s)

[interesting that they uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m15s)

[didn't like it I mean so I some people](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m19s)

[have strong opinions on it because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m23s)

[there's there's several libraries out](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m24s)

[there for command line apps that existed](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m27s)

[long before this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m28s)

[um this is the one that powers the.net](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m31s)

[SDK so if there's any questions about](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m33s)

[whether it's stable enough I mean](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m35s)

[Microsoft has staked their SDK on it so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m37s)

[is that but from the the terminology](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m40s)

[here I was interpreting it the inherited](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m44s)

[flags as an option that existed on a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m48s)

[Parent Command typically like the root](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m51s)

[command or something that's the way I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m53s)

[had interpreted it but uh they didn't](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m55s)

[understand the UI aspects because they](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h51m59s)

[were web-based they couldn't be bothered](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m01s)

[to translate something text](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m04s)

[oh ouch I am sorry](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m07s)

[I am sorry](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m11s)

[yeah that's that's the way I had in I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m17s)

[had interpreted it but yeah we will we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m21s)

[will see how it goes I I know that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m23s)

[there's there's some other tooling that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m26s)

[the GitHub team has built that's in C](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m27s)

[sharp that actually uses that system](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m30s)

[command line Library as well which I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m31s)

[love because then I intuitively know](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m33s)

[that the syntax is going to behave in a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m36s)

[same in a sane manner but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m38s)

[this one's written in go so I'd have no](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m41s)

[idea](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m43s)

[I have no idea it it seems to behave in](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m45s)

[the same manage manner except for all of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m47s)

[their examples are crap so aside from](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m49s)

[that minor detail](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m55s)

[okay did I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m56s)

[I closed the one thing I wanted](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h52m59s)

[I want to keep that action open so I can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m01s)

[actually watch it go](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m03s)

[uh action](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m06s)

[tell me much more about them they told](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m09s)

[me about me](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m10s)

[yeah and that was actually one of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m16s)

[motivations for building that system](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m19s)

[command line library is there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m22s)

[different opinions out there about how](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m25s)

[CLI should behave the closest thing to a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m26s)

[standard is posix](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m29s)

[um but there's enough there's enough](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m33s)

[there and there's a lot of ambiguity](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m35s)

[around certain areas](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m37s)

[of it that is not consistent like posix](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m39s)

[bundling where you can chain a bunch of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m42s)

[your options into a single single one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m44s)

[and it goes oh yeah you know if you do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m46s)

[Dash like uh git is a good example like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m48s)

[uh get clean uh FSX or where you chain a](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m52s)

[bunch of things together is the same as](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m55s)

[if you were to specify Dash F or what is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h53m57s)

[it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m00s)

[get clean DFX is the same as the as Dash](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m01s)

[D Dash F Dash X because it's bundled all](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m05s)

[of those things together and it gets to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m08s)

[be having libraries that do all of that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m10s)

[support yeah uh wasn't there an open](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m13s)

[source Library commandment uh](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m16s)

[uh yeah so there was one called and that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m21s)

[was part of why Microsoft ended up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m24s)

[writing one too is there was at the time](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m25s)

[they did it I think there were only like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m27s)

[three or four that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m29s)

[were being actively maintained so there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m31s)

[was a command line there was one called](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m34s)

[like command line by itself](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m36s)

[I believe there was a new get package](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m38s)

[for it but it it wasn't one that was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m40s)

[actively being maintained there was one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m42s)

[from Nate McMaster](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m44s)

[that that was actively being maintained](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m47s)

[and at the time Nate was actually](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m50s)

[working](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m52s)

[um working for Microsoft and he helped](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m54s)

[on the system command line Library so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m56s)

[that was so every time people were like](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h54m58s)

[oh you're trying to steal from him we're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m00s)

[like you you do know he's helping right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m01s)

[like it's kind of hard to say that we](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m03s)

[did it oh yeah specter's awesome](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m05s)

[um and so the the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m14s)

[uh the guy who actually runs Specter](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m15s)

[he's actually uh Consulting on the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m17s)

[system command line Library as well and](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m20s)

[there's been a lot of collaboration](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m22s)

[because the system command line library](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m24s)

[at one point you'll you'll note in the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m26s)

[repo there's like this rendering project](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m28s)

[where where we had experimented with](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m30s)

[doing like uh ANSI codes and and how to](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m33s)

[do the fancy rendering stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m36s)

[and then we're like why](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m38s)

[the Specter is awesome and so we kind of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m41s)

[Switched gears and said you know what](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m44s)

[would be better is if we just made this](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m45s)

[library and Specter work really well](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m48s)

[together that way everything could](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m51s)

[benefit so there's a branch on the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m53s)

[Specter project that is because right](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m56s)

[now they have their own](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h55m59s)

[um built-in parsing but there's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m01s)

[different bugs with it and whatnot](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m06s)

[yeah Specter is very good at dealing](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m07s)

[with all of the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m10s)

[um I don't know if it's necessarily](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m12s)

[cross-plat I'd say it's almost different](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m13s)

[in terminals because ANSI support across](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m15s)

[different terminals is really all over](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m18s)

[the board uh like even in Windows](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m21s)

[um and I didn't realize this prior but](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m25s)

[like the the underlying rendering for](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m27s)

[your CMD and Powershell terminals used](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m30s)

[to be different in latest Windows](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m32s)

[they've now moved to be the same thank](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m34s)

[goodness rather than one being crap](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m39s)

[but they used to have different](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m40s)

[rendering and there was a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m42s)

[weirdness around well if this version do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m44s)

[this if this version do that and so](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m47s)

[Specter does a really good job of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m49s)

[dealing with all of those edge cases](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m51s)

[especially on like Linux where there is](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m53s)

[a a large variety of terminals that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m56s)

[people may choose from it does a pretty](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h56m59s)

[good job of yeah your fallback](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m02s)

[mechanisms](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m04s)

[um of of trying to figure out what the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m06s)

[terminal capabilities are and then make](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m09s)

[an intelligent guess about the best way](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m12s)

[to render something that way you can](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m13s)

[still get a reasonable experience](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m15s)

[without it just feeling like crap](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m17s)

[because oftentimes anybody who writes](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m20s)

[ANSI codes directly to the terminal](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m23s)

[because this was the problem we ran into](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m24s)

[very quickly is it's really hard to do](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m26s)

[that in a cross-platform way you end up](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m28s)

[almost having to build this terminal](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m31s)

[abstraction and doing a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m36s)

[yes yes absolutely and it the](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m40s)

[shoot I'm blanking on the name of it](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m45s)

[it's a very POS so the one that you get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m49s)

[in writer I believe is the same one that](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m51s)

[you pick up in like vs code and get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m53s)

[cracking](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m56s)

[um because it's been](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h57m58s)

[um a fairly popular open source terminal](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m01s)

[implementation and I think it's gained](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m03s)

[popularity shoot what is its name](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m06s)

[oh thanks for the follow so much uh it's](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m10s)

[it's largely been popular because it was](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m14s)

[cross-plat and a reasonably good one](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m17s)

[um and so a bunch of people have picked](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m21s)

[it up and embedded it into their stuff](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m23s)

[which has been I I've approved of](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m26s)

[because anytime you can get some level](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m28s)

[of standardization or at least get](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m30s)

[everybody to agree on a solution you're](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m31s)

[halfway there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m34s)

[halfway there](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m38s)

[so close I want to see this thing run I](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m39s)

[really want to see this thing work](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m41s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m46s)

[for teaching me something well thank you](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m48s)

[uh I usually I stream for fun uh because](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m51s)

[I enjoy coding and my rationale is if](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m55s)

[I'm having fun somebody else might enjoy](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h58m58s)

[it too](https://youtu.be/UqksXnML4j4?t=02h59m00s)
