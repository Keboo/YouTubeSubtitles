[announcements and then a couple material](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m08s)

[design things that i uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m09s)

[wanted to go over and then continue](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m11s)

[working on the theme brushes for anyone](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m13s)

[following the repo on github you'll note](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m15s)

[that the 430 milestone](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m18s)

[is basically at like 98](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m20s)

[mostly because a bunch of the stuff that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m23s)

[got thrown in there was already done](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m25s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m26s)

[but i do want to start kind of getting](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m27s)

[calamity um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m57s)

[effectively i have written some of the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h00m59s)

[worst possible code i could come up with](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m01s)

[um i tried to make it look as reasonable](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m03s)

[as possible but then um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m04s)

[kind of went off the deep end so just to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m08s)

[on my github or github twitter um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m17s)

[if you are interested this is the code](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m22s)

[we will be discussing it looks so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m24s)

[reasonable and then you start comparing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m26s)

[this code to the output and you realize](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m28s)

[how completely unreasonable it is so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h01m30s)

[perhaps doing some pull request stuff](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m02s)

[but we'll see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m04s)

[up in the air up in the air](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m08s)

[now on to the interesting stuff so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m09s)

[material design and xaml the last big](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m11s)

[item that or i shouldn't say last big](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m14s)

[item the current big item](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m16s)

[for uh getting out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m19s)

[the the next 430 release](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m24s)

[for a very long time](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m25s)

[the repository has not standardized on](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m28s)

[its brush names which has always annoyed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m31s)

[me i always got confused between](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m33s)

[material design body and material design](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m37s)

[paper and which one i was supposed to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m39s)

[use when and it annoyed me to no end um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m40s)

[those were based upon early versions of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m44s)

[the material design spec they've since](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m47s)

[abandoned that naming scheme themselves](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m49s)

[this library just is never updated to do](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m51s)

[it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m53s)

[mostly because it's a big breaking](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m54s)

[change](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m55s)

[however my plan is to introduce both the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h04m57s)

[new names alongside of the old names](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m00s)

[until the 5.0 release to give people a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m02s)

[chance to update](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m04s)

[and then hopefully](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m06s)

[by the 5-0 release i'm just going to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m08s)

[delete all the old names so that way](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m10s)

[there's there's some buffer period](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m12s)

[ideally some good docs um some of these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m14s)

[need to be updated uh and we'll go over](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m16s)

[that here in a moment](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m19s)

[but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m20s)

[hopefully this standardization of the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m21s)

[naming makes it a lot easier for people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m23s)

[to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m26s)

[one find the brushes that they're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m26s)

[looking for and two i want to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m28s)

[expand the brushes because there's been](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m31s)

[a lot of issues about hey i want to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m33s)

[toggle this color or that color or i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m35s)

[want to control this individually and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m37s)

[there's never been a good way to do it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m38s)

[and it hasn't been clear on how to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m41s)

[introduce new brushes because there's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m42s)

[not been a clear way of of setting that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m44s)

[up so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m46s)

[i'm kind of trying to kill two birds](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m47s)

[with one stone here and hopefully make](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m49s)

[all of that work](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m51s)

[rather nicely so this is the one that i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m52s)

[have been going on and there's an open](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m55s)

[pr that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m57s)

[just uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h05m58s)

[um did i not link it there it is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m03s)

[no](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m05s)

[this is there there's some other issues](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m08s)

[that are related to it did i not link my](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m10s)

[own pr to this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m11s)

[that was dumb of me hang on there's an](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m14s)

[open pr for this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m16s)

[oh look at that i did not link it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m20s)

[about](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m23s)

[fixes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m24s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m25s)

[how about actually i don't want it to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m30s)

[auto close it i think that's probably](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m31s)

[why i didn't uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m33s)

[first](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m34s)

[set of changes for boom](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m36s)

[at least that way it's linked so there's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m40s)

[quite a few changes here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m42s)

[and i kind of want to go over one of the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m44s)

[most important changes is rather subtle](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m46s)

[but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m51s)

[let's let's take a look at it here real](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m52s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m55s)

[there there's been at least a few](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m56s)

[different ways of setting up the theming](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h06m58s)

[in the library for a while](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m00s)

[and my](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m02s)

[my preferred method is with the bundled](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m03s)

[theme or the custom color theme like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m06s)

[this because it's very easy there's some](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m07s)

[enum properties on this custom resource](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m09s)

[dictionary makes it easy to set it up](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m12s)

[and get rolling you can do the fancy](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m14s)

[color adjustment stuff it's awesome it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m16s)

[great](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m18s)

[worked wonderful the problem with this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m20s)

[is you don't get](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m22s)

[xaml intellisense because these uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m24s)

[bundled themes added the resources in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m28s)

[code behind and so the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m31s)

[the xaml interpreter had no way of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m33s)

[knowing what resources were going to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m34s)

[there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m36s)

[this is being fixed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m37s)

[so down here you will note i have made a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m40s)

[resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m43s)

[but i have attached a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m45s)

[code behind file to it because normally](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m48s)

[if you just do new resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m50s)

[you don't get the code behind file but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m52s)

[you can actually attach a code behind](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m54s)

[file to any resource dictionary with the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h07m56s)

[x class and just point it at the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m00s)

[appropriate class this is the same way](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m02s)

[like when you do new window if you look](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m03s)

[at what it generates you get something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m05s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m07s)

[and then constructor with initialize](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m08s)

[component and actually let's expression](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m10s)

[body that guy great done](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m18s)

[ooh could i retur a quest a topic switch](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m20s)

[perhaps all the fun going on with azure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m22s)

[these days like oh 365 ad federated](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m25s)

[services etc wow robert you picked only](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m28s)

[a few small things um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m31s)

[could you narrow it down a little bit](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m35s)

[because all the fun stuff going on in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m39s)

[azure is kind of broad but yes i am](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m41s)

[happy to to deviate](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m43s)

[because there is there is quite a bit of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m49s)

[stuff going on](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m51s)

[oh all the security breaches oh dear](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m53s)

[heavens okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m55s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m57s)

[so let's um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h08m57s)

[so i i think one of the big one uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m01s)

[microsoft](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m06s)

[cosmos](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m06s)

[a breach](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m09s)

[notebooks i i don't know exactly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m15s)

[yeah this was](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m18s)

[i think this yeah yeah the chaos db](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m22s)

[so this one came out um as you can see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m26s)

[on this one august 27th it was end of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m29s)

[last month i don't recall exactly which](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m32s)

[um but basically what happened](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m35s)

[is the uh inside of azure for cosmos db](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m37s)

[um there was a feature that was enabled](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m43s)

[called notebooks which is which is a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m45s)

[wonderful idea of a feature and that it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m47s)

[gave you a nice easy way to kind of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m50s)

[interact with your database test out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m52s)

[some code back and forth](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m53s)

[however a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m56s)

[some security researchers realized that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h09m57s)

[with a simple switch of an id](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m00s)

[they could jump from their database to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m03s)

[anyone else's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m07s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m10s)

[find me a link to that active directory](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m12s)

[one that one i haven't read up on robert](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m13s)

[but for the cosmos one the key thing to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m16s)

[know is microsoft a claimed to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m19s)

[contact everyone](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m23s)

[um who would have been affected by this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m25s)

[so it would have only been people who](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m27s)

[had um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m29s)

[either created a cosmos](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m31s)

[and don't quote me on these dates](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m33s)

[created a cosmos db account after](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m35s)

[february of this year](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m37s)

[or had turned on the notebook feature](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m39s)

[for cosmos db those were](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m41s)

[according to microsoft the only people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m44s)

[that would have been um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m46s)

[theoretically exposed here um microsoft](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m49s)

[also said that they had contacted](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m51s)

[everybody that they thought was exposed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m53s)

[um and gave them a heads up to go](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m56s)

[through and cycle their access keys](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h10m58s)

[because ultimately that was what](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m00s)

[happened is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m02s)

[um using the notebook feature they were](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m03s)

[able to gain access to your your access](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m05s)

[key to your cosmos db which is the keys](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m07s)

[to the kingdom](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m10s)

[with the with somebody's cosmos db](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m11s)

[access key that's the thing that you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m13s)

[treat like the password that you keep](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m15s)

[under lock and key and don't share ever](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m17s)

[because it gives somebody free reign to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m19s)

[run when rampant on your db which is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m21s)

[which is not a great thing to have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m24s)

[exposed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m26s)

[um i know several of our clients we went](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m27s)

[through and did a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m29s)

[um a standard key rotation on all the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m32s)

[cosmos dbs even though we weren't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m34s)

[supposed to be one of the clients that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m36s)

[were affected um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m37s)

[just for paranoia sake we cycled all the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m39s)

[keys so when in doubt um underneath your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m42s)

[cosmos db the access keys section um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m45s)

[there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m49s)

[underneath each of your keys there's a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m50s)

[little button there to cycle it go](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m52s)

[through and cycle it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m53s)

[and this is also a good opportunity to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m55s)

[bring up the idea of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m57s)

[just because you're in azure the whole](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h11m59s)

[idea of making sure that you've got a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m01s)

[good remediation approach](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m04s)

[for when these types of breaches happen](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m07s)

[microsoft's not going to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m09s)

[build that for you that's something you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m11s)

[have to build into your own application](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m12s)

[because obviously if you go and cycle](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m14s)

[that key](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m16s)

[and some other app is using that key you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m17s)

[have now broken that app's connectivity](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m19s)

[to its database that is not good there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m21s)

[are many ways around this managed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m23s)

[identity being an easy one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m25s)

[because then there are no keys at play](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m27s)

[it's much easier to to deal with you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m29s)

[don't have to worry about passwords and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m31s)

[that kind of thing because there are no](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m33s)

[passwords](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m34s)

[so that is one option but obviously you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m36s)

[have to set your application up to work](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m37s)

[that way and make sure that that is all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m40s)

[set up so when in doubt make sure you've](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m42s)

[got a good remediation plan for when](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m44s)

[these types of things happen because i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m45s)

[think the short answer is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m48s)

[this type of stuff is always going to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m50s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m51s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m53s)

[that is on you to make sure that you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m54s)

[build that out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h12m57s)

[and then let's take a look at this one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m00s)

[because this one i have not seen yet](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m02s)

[active directory federation services](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m06s)

[oh so this one's a little older april](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m12s)

[oh and this one's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m17s)

[okay at least they're only gaining a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m18s)

[smaller amount of this this isn't i take](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m21s)

[your aad account](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m23s)

[single okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m30s)

[some of my federation services](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m33s)

[however attacks identified](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m41s)

[to exchange online messages](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m46s)

[oh hello](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m48s)

[i appreciate you looking for a good one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m54s)

[however it grew](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m55s)

[to take your credentials privately oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h13m57s)

[oh that's bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m00s)

[um via token](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m05s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m10s)

[can generate arbitrary saml tokens to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m11s)

[access federated as any user and even](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m14s)

[bypass mfa authentication](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m17s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m19s)

[oh that's bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m21s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m31s)

[yeah well yes i agree anything that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m34s)

[allows you to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m36s)

[to uh effectively impersonate a user or](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m40s)

[gain creds](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m42s)

[it's just](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m44s)

[like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m45s)

[it's scary in and of itself but then](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m47s)

[once you are able to usually sidestep](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m50s)

[from one service into the other stuff](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m53s)

[because you can imagine if you'd get](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m55s)

[like a network admin](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m56s)

[creds](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m58s)

[what then that gives you access to and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h14m59s)

[the amount of damage you can run rampant](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m02s)

[i mean these these types of attacks are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m04s)

[a a beautiful example of why people or](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m06s)

[specifically security teams advocate for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m09s)

[lease permissions it's not how much you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m12s)

[trust your people because you can have a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m14s)

[company filled with awesome people that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m16s)

[you absolutely trust but if something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m18s)

[happens](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m21s)

[possibly through no fault of your own](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m22s)

[where one of those accounts gets](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m24s)

[compromised and they and the attacker is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m26s)

[then able to take that compromised](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m29s)

[account and just run rampant through all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m30s)

[of your stuff that's bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m33s)

[like i've heard people actually try to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m36s)

[use the argument oh well we trust our](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m37s)

[people it's fine it's like i don't care](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m39s)

[how much you trust them it's not how](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m41s)

[much you trust your own people it's how](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m42s)

[much you trust the attacker that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m44s)

[compromises their account](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m45s)

[it's that that person you shouldn't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m47s)

[trust at all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m49s)

[and so making sure that people have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m51s)

[the minimum permission necessary](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m54s)

[like it definitely annoys me on on some](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h15m57s)

[of the uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m00s)

[the clients that we go through with all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m01s)

[of the security hurdles and some of them](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m02s)

[feel](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m04s)

[completely meaningless](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m05s)

[but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m07s)

[most of them are at least well-meaning](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m09s)

[intentions to to mitigate the risk of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m11s)

[something like this happening](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m25s)

[this first bullet point for mitigating](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m26s)

[it i would kind of hope that people were](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m28s)

[already doing this already](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m31s)

[i mean typically with firewalls the the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m33s)

[general rule is deny everything and only](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m35s)

[open up as small a hole as possible in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m39s)

[your firewall to either](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m41s)

[say well-known servers that you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m46s)

[and as few ports as possible i mean this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m47s)

[is typically how we lock down most](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m50s)

[firewalls so that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m51s)

[okay sure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h16m55s)

[okay even better don't use the unsecured](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m01s)

[port and just go](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m04s)

[through 443 which i assume is gonna be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m05s)

[um like https so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m09s)

[secured](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m15s)

[inbound communications can be delivered](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m16s)

[by making some firewall configuration](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m18s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m20s)

[alerts can be set for policies so to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m24s)

[detect this sort of attack behavior](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m26s)

[great](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m28s)

[right yeah so 443 https and 80 is http](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m31s)

[yeah and this is the other one that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m50s)

[people often forget about is supply](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m52s)

[chain attacks](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m56s)

[making sure that you actually audit](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m57s)

[everything that you're dependent upon](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h17m59s)

[because this is actually one thing that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m01s)

[that people often forget is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m03s)

[you know it's very easy and we often](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m05s)

[take for granted how easy it is to pull](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m08s)

[in dependencies](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m10s)

[um and if a downstream dependency gets](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m12s)

[compromised you may be doing everything](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m17s)

[right](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m19s)

[but then that dependency gets broken](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m20s)

[and now you're vulnerable because of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m23s)

[that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m25s)

[so it is worth making sure that there is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m26s)

[reasonable auditing and reasonable](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m32s)

[scanning of this kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m34s)

[and robert you would be a good one to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m39s)

[ask i i've actually contemplated doing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m41s)

[doing a stream where](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m44s)

[i basically go through and stand up like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m46s)

[a very simple like asp net core web api](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m49s)

[deploy into kubernetes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m52s)

[you know maybe have it connect to a sql](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m54s)

[database managed identity all of that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m57s)

[works and setting it up because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h18m59s)

[what i've at least seen so far is you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m01s)

[can find tutorials for like small pieces](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m06s)

[but there there's only there's only so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m08s)

[much](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m11s)

[um out there and i've never really found](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m12s)

[a good end-to-end one see what kind of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m15s)

[reasonable trust do we put on nougat](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m17s)

[especially with everything going going](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m19s)

[to nougat](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m21s)

[yeah so like a lot of um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m22s)

[places that that i work at there's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m25s)

[there's a reasonable amount of trust but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m29s)

[what typically happens is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m32s)

[if you can assume that the library is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m36s)

[reasonably following semantic versioning](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m38s)

[quite often what happens is the the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m41s)

[policy is set such that there should be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m43s)

[a security review of dependencies for at](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m46s)

[least major versions](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m49s)

[um and then](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m51s)

[it could depend a little bit on the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m52s)

[publisher or whatnot but occasionally](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m54s)

[also minor version revs as well with the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m56s)

[expectation that you're always updating](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h19m58s)

[to get the um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m00s)

[the revision changes that third digit](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m03s)

[because those ones are typically your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m05s)

[security patches](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m07s)

[but then](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m10s)

[if a library was going to say add a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m11s)

[dependency or similar that should be a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m13s)

[major revision change and so making sure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m16s)

[they](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m19s)

[that that somebody has at least had eyes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m20s)

[on it and evaluated it because it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m22s)

[really hard](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m24s)

[like you can go through um something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m26s)

[like varicode scanning or similar to try](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m29s)

[and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m31s)

[find problems and notify you if you're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m32s)

[using something that's um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m35s)

[that's vulnerable the other thing and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m38s)

[this actually uh quartz.net for the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m40s)

[longest time why did they hate](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m43s)

[quartz.net](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m44s)

[um so uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m46s)

[what is it called](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m49s)

[dependabot i think is what it is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m51s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m54s)

[and actually if you are out on](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m55s)

[uh it's not what is the other one it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h20m59s)

[not depend-a-bot um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m01s)

[github does security scanning](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m06s)

[what is the name of that thingy](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m07s)

[no](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m17s)

[about github advanced security](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m19s)

[so if you were actually hosting your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m22s)

[stuff on um github enterprise oh because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m24s)

[they didn't understand it um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m27s)

[github actually does a pretty good job](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m30s)

[of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m33s)

[scanning your code and especially for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m33s)

[dependencies with vulnerabilities like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m36s)

[dependabot um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m38s)

[what it will do is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m40s)

[it'll um look through your repository so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m42s)

[they actually prioritize and look at um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m45s)

[what dependencies you're taking so that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m48s)

[means github has to be able to look into](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m51s)

[a repo](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m52s)

[uh based upon you know the language and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m54s)

[framework you're using know about](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m56s)

[how your package manager works so for c](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h21m58s)

[sharp nuget](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m01s)

[goes through and will scan packages and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m03s)

[it gets updated and notified when there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m05s)

[are security vulnerabilities and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m08s)

[packages and it will actually send you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m09s)

[pull requests and the pull request that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m12s)

[dependabot sends for say updating a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m14s)

[dependency when there's a known](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m16s)

[vulnerability](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m17s)

[not everyone can see that pull request](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m19s)

[so there's actually a visibility scope](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m21s)

[on pull requests that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m23s)

[these built-in scanners get to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m25s)

[use so only people with um write](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m27s)

[permission on the repository can](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m30s)

[actually see those pull requests so it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m32s)

[doesn't necessarily broadcast to the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m34s)

[world hey there's um a vulnerability in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m35s)

[your repository you just get this quiet](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m38s)

[pull request that comes in that only you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m41s)

[know your users can or your users with](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m43s)

[write permission can see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m46s)

[and then they can review it and update](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m47s)

[and hopefully if you've got ci cd turned](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m50s)

[on or at least ci to check the pr coming](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m52s)

[in you can validate oh yeah okay you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m55s)

[know this new version of the library](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m57s)

[doesn't break anything except pr merge](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h22m59s)

[it in vulnerability fixed which is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m01s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m03s)

[the other thing that they have is for um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m04s)

[like code scanning and secrets they can](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m08s)

[actually um detect with a reasonably](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m11s)

[high degree of accuracy if somebody](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m14s)

[accidentally checks in a secret into](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m16s)

[your source code because that's bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m18s)

[right you could go back and rewrite git](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m20s)

[history but um often times what really](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m22s)

[needs to happen you need to cycle that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m25s)

[secret because um it is remarkably](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m26s)

[impressive how fast um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m29s)

[uh these bots that scan github looking](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m32s)

[for secrets can find someone's mistake](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m35s)

[and exploit it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m37s)

[ridiculously fast so the moment that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m39s)

[discovered you really need to be cycling](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m41s)

[those keys on a lot of the popular ones](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m43s)

[github actually goes a step further so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m46s)

[like say you checking your aws key for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m49s)

[something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m51s)

[they can if if github can actually](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m52s)

[detect that that is an aws key they will](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m54s)

[actually send a request over to aws](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h23m57s)

[disable that key and send you a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m00s)

[notification](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m02s)

[saying hang on you check something into](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m04s)

[a public repo and i should i should](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m06s)

[clarify public repo not private private](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m08s)

[github kind of goes well this is private](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m11s)

[this is kind of on you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m13s)

[we don't know what you're doing you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m15s)

[it's probably private for a reason etc](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m16s)

[etc but public repos if they see it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m18s)

[they'll actually try to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m22s)

[shut it down and cause that cycle to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m24s)

[occur on you right away to prevent](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m26s)

[anyone from being able to exploit it and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m28s)

[compromise your stuff so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m30s)

[if you're hosting github and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m33s)

[specifically are are able to take](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m35s)

[advantage of some of these code scanning](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m36s)

[and dependent bot stuff this stuff is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m39s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m41s)

[and it's remarkably good sorry i did see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m42s)

[your question robert i just got on a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m45s)

[tangent and kept going um what code](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m46s)

[scanning tools would you recommend oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m49s)

[boy so that gets](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m51s)

[that gets hard](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m54s)

[and um we were actually having a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m55s)

[discussion about this um in the office](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h24m58s)

[today um specifically trying to figure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m00s)

[out what is a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m03s)

[kind of a generic way of doing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m05s)

[effectively like security auditing of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m11s)

[software and what would be the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m13s)

[appropriate thing to do and it's really](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m15s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m17s)

[to give](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m18s)

[generic recommendations because so much](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m19s)

[depends on exactly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m22s)

[um yeah unfortunately these tools bots](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m26s)

[are not on azure devops i i agree but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m30s)

[remember also what i what i said though](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m34s)

[is the github tools are are um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m36s)

[primarily targeting public repositories](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m39s)

[and enterprise ones so they aren't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m42s)

[necessarily](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m44s)

[they aren't going after your private](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m46s)

[repos and azure devops tends to not be a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m47s)

[place for public repos they tend to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m50s)

[more internal obviously you can make](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m54s)

[them public but typically that's not the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m56s)

[way people are sharing code so it's a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h25m58s)

[to some degree](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m01s)

[in my mind it almost makes a little more](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m02s)

[sense that they would go a little more](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m04s)

[hands off on devops](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m06s)

[but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m07s)

[for what it's worth you you are correct](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m08s)

[but there is quite a bit of stuff going](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m10s)

[into the github um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m12s)

[just as one more good reason why you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m15s)

[should host stuff on github because it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m17s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m19s)

[and wonderful](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m20s)

[uh where was i going oh so generic tools](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m22s)

[for for doing scanning](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m27s)

[let me think](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m30s)

[i mean the github stuff if you're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m33s)

[looking for something for a public repo](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m35s)

[that's free](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m37s)

[is good i don't know if there's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m38s)

[i don't know if there's a lot of tools i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m43s)

[could say that i've](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m45s)

[used and would recommend that are free](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m47s)

[like i know so like varicode is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m51s)

[obviously](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m53s)

[um a very popular one and it does depend](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m54s)

[a little bit on what type of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h26m57s)

[scanning you're looking for because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m00s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m03s)

[there's kind of a large breadth of areas](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m05s)

[where you almost need to evaluate what](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m08s)

[you're building and what type of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m10s)

[vulnerabilities you're looking for so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m11s)

[something that scans code is going to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m14s)

[looking for either you know bad coding](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m16s)

[practices vulnerable dependencies](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m18s)

[accidental secret checks in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m25s)

[security vulnerabilities code smells](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m30s)

[yeah so you're so you're specifically](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m34s)

[going for code scanning level stuff](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m39s)

[what what would be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m50s)

[so the honestly the github stuff would](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h27m59s)

[be the first one i would go for um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m01s)

[the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m05s)

[vera code for like a paid solution does](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m06s)

[a fairly good job of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m10s)

[scanning and looking for vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m12s)

[um code smells you're not really gonna](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m15s)

[land in security software type stuff for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m18s)

[most of that a lot of times those are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m21s)

[gonna come down to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m23s)

[more like your coding practices](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m30s)

[type situations](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m32s)

[trying to think of what](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m35s)

[what would be the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m41s)

[sorry i'm trying to look through my my](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m49s)

[list of tools to see if i'm missing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m51s)

[anything that i should be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m53s)

[that i should be calling out yeah end](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m56s)

[depend is definitely a good one um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h28m58s)

[that would go through and do it uh to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m02s)

[some degree a lot of the jetbrains](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m04s)

[products so if somebody's using either](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m06s)

[writer resharper um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m09s)

[they they can help do it independ is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m13s)

[really good at](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m15s)

[catching like um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m18s)

[duplicated code and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m21s)

[and poor coding practices and to some](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m23s)

[degree a lot of security vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m26s)

[come down to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m28s)

[poor coding practices to begin with it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m33s)

[things that start as just](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m34s)

[messy code that then propagate into](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m36s)

[something worse](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m38s)

[right like those those types of things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m40s)

[tend to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m42s)

[um like it doesn't occur nearly as much](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m43s)

[in the the c sharp realm but like the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m46s)

[buffer overflow exceptions tend to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m48s)

[ones that get abused all the time where](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m50s)

[or somebody's code isn't appropriately](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m53s)

[bounce checking and you're able to you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m55s)

[know run off the end of the buffer and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m57s)

[and get access to things that you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h29m59s)

[shouldn't be able to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m02s)

[which those types of things often start](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m04s)

[as poor coding practices that then](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m07s)

[uh propagate forward](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m10s)

[so i think](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m13s)

[yeah independ would is the is one that i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m14s)

[had that i have used and i should](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m17s)

[actually get that installed in vs](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m19s)

[since i do have a license to it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m21s)

[currently](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m23s)

[i've not played with it in a while need](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m24s)

[to do that again i i have a stream](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m26s)

[um a while back robert where](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m28s)

[i think i don't know let me let me let](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m31s)

[me pull this up](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m33s)

[i'm pretty sure if i do](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m36s)

[yeah i was on the stream yeah this guy](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m44s)

[though](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m46s)

[for anybody else watching this later so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m47s)

[i do have a stream where they](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m49s)

[uh independence sent me a license to go](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m52s)

[through and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m54s)

[use and play with it it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m56s)

[it is remarkably good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h30m58s)

[so to their credit it is it is very good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m00s)

[software um i specifically like that it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m05s)

[does unlike a lot of stuff that can slow](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m08s)

[down your development flow](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m11s)

[it doesn't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m13s)

[um mostly because it's intended to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m14s)

[typically run in the in a pipeline is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m17s)

[where i would um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m19s)

[usually leverage it just to be able to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m21s)

[get those those metrics and make sure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m23s)

[that you're always pushing forward](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m25s)

[because one of the things that it does](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m26s)

[is it tries to get basically a benchmark](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m28s)

[of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m30s)

[here's where you're currently at](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m31s)

[right we've got all of these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m33s)

[recommendations of stuff you can fix](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m34s)

[you've got all this code debt you've got](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m36s)

[this that and that problem](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m38s)

[and oftentimes on big repos you just](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m40s)

[can't ingest all of that at once like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m42s)

[nobody's going to pay for you to spend](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m44s)

[eight ten weeks fixing all of these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m46s)

[issues and there is some diminishing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m48s)

[returns when you get near the top too](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m50s)

[um but it does the the benchmark and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m52s)

[then just always basically tries to keep](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m55s)

[you moving forward so as long as you're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m57s)

[moving in a positive direction that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h31m58s)

[what's important rather than trying to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m01s)

[bite off everything at once and so i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m03s)

[really appreciate that about it rather](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m04s)

[than a lot of tools that try to say hey](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m06s)

[let me update this problem everywhere in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m09s)

[your code base it's like](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m11s)

[no](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m13s)

[please don't do that that would be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m14s)

[horrible i do not want to ingest that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m16s)

[kind of change right now maybe you do if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m18s)

[you if you're able to do that awesome](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m20s)

[that's even better but most of the time](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m22s)

[especially in large repos you you can't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m24s)

[just ingest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m26s)

[wholesale changes willy-nilly that ends](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m28s)

[up getting to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m31s)

[highly problematic](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m32s)

[what else robert are there any tools you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m35s)

[use that i haven't mentioned](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m37s)

[that are worth looking at](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m40s)

[um one other one that i'll i'll call out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m41s)

[uh was it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m44s)

[roslinator](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m48s)

[where's the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m51s)

[the website](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m53s)

[yeah this one here so specifically in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m55s)

[terms of like visual studio c-sharp](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h32m58s)

[analyzers](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m04s)

[roslinator has quite a few of them](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m08s)

[and specifically around trying to do](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m10s)

[trying to be as helpful as possible and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m15s)

[these ones tend to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m17s)

[um a lot of community driven um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m19s)

[and so uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m22s)

[let's see analyzers](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m24s)

[so you can see how many of them are in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m26s)

[here and and written up](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m29s)

[oh sonar cube yes so that is one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m31s)

[so i will say i use sonar cube](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m36s)

[indirectly so i work on projects that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m40s)

[have set up sonar cube](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m43s)

[i don't actually ever use it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m48s)

[i i've never set it up myself](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m49s)

[but but again another another good one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m54s)

[for actually going through and trying to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m57s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h33m59s)

[code scanning to look for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m02s)

[security vulnerabilities](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m06s)

[or or errors that could cause you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m08s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m09s)

[there are some other ones too that are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m15s)

[here i'll call out this one as well](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m23s)

[so salt security um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m25s)

[and again this kind of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m29s)

[with a lot of this security stuff it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m31s)

[really comes down to knowing what you're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m32s)

[scanning at what level and why](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m34s)

[um so this one takes a a different](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m37s)

[approach to it this does not attack it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m40s)

[at the code level so this is downstream](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m42s)

[obviously with the whole idea of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m44s)

[shifting left the earlier you can catch](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m46s)

[in the development process the better](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m48s)

[but there are some things that are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m51s)

[difficult to catch at the code level](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m55s)

[because it may not be apparent that oh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h34m58s)

[you know you're accidentally leaking out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m01s)

[the this um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m02s)

[you know pii type information right so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m05s)

[you you know somebody's social is is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m09s)

[being leaked out of an api that that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m11s)

[that's bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m15s)

[um this takes the intent of scanning the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m16s)

[the running apis](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m20s)

[um to try to give you that kind of cons](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m22s)

[uh context of looking at what's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m25s)

[happening](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m28s)

[while your api](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m29s)

[those vulnerabilities that could come in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m33s)

[at run time against your api so that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m35s)

[the um the salt security stuff that has](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m37s)

[been set up so i i do have some](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m41s)

[experience um setting this up and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m43s)

[running this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m46s)

[it's pretty good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m50s)

[i question the word every here because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m53s)

[anyone who claims they can do everything](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m55s)

[is probably lying to you and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h35m57s)

[a bit of marketing ease but it is a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m00s)

[reasonable thing but again we've now](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m02s)

[shifted](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m04s)

[from the developer code area and more](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m05s)

[into like an ops](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m08s)

[level scanning type thing because there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m10s)

[are plenty of software things that'll](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m13s)

[like scan your your docker images for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m15s)

[example and that kind of thing and again](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m18s)

[that's that's now a little bit further](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m20s)

[right of the development process and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m22s)

[we're now](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m24s)

[getting into you know your your devops](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m25s)

[land um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m28s)

[which it is worth having those those](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m30s)

[gates and those checks there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m32s)

[but if you can catch it early that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m34s)

[obviously better](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m36s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m38s)

[some something worth to take into](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m39s)

[consideration and then obviously all the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m41s)

[way even further over you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m43s)

[you've got your um your ids your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m45s)

[intrusion detection systems for looking](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m48s)

[for like ongoing attacks and that kind](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m50s)

[of thing and that's that's usually in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m52s)

[your infosec realm of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m54s)

[of trying to catch things while running](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h36m59s)

[with cosmos db](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m01s)

[db](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m03s)

[breach wow](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m04s)

[how about keeping uh database and data](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m06s)

[encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m09s)

[uh is it a necessity or is it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m11s)

[or is it okay to keep data unencrypted](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m14s)

[at rest ah](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m16s)

[so the cosmos db breach](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m19s)

[wouldn't have mattered either way](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m23s)

[because with with that breach they were](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m26s)

[um able to compromise access keys which](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m29s)

[meant you could come in looking like a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m32s)

[legitimate connection](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m35s)

[which is unfortunate](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m38s)

[and with with the cosmos db stuff the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m40s)

[other thing to keep in mind is a lot of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m43s)

[azure services](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m46s)

[like specifically like sql servers and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m47s)

[and key vaults and those kind of things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m50s)

[typically also have kind of their own](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m52s)

[access firewall type policy where you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m54s)

[can say you have to be an approved user](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m56s)

[but also from like this v-net or this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h37m59s)

[set of approved ips so oftentimes those](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m02s)

[things are even more locked down so they](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m05s)

[aren't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m07s)

[even though they may look like they're](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m08s)

[publicly accessible their access](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m09s)

[policies are going to significantly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m11s)

[limit them to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m12s)

[you know only](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m14s)

[only allowed sources so you kind of have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m16s)

[to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m18s)

[not just compromise the key but a little](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m19s)

[bit more than that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m21s)

[the idea with the data encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m22s)

[um is effectively like you can imagine](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m26s)

[if you were writing the c sharp uh when](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m28s)

[you go to actually](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m31s)

[save the data off to a disk and it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m32s)

[sitting there on disk rather than say](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m35s)

[loaded in memory so when it's at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m38s)

[you can imagine the the disk sitting](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m40s)

[there the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m42s)

[the big idea with data at rest is if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m43s)

[somebody's able to get access to that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m46s)

[data or get access to that hard drive](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m48s)

[you could imagine if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m50s)

[you know in the case of um say virtual](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m52s)

[machines where you where somebody's able](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m54s)

[to get access to maybe the the vhd file](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m56s)

[so the virtual hard drive image if they](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h38m58s)

[were able to take that and take it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m01s)

[somewhere else and load it up on their](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m02s)

[own vm could they gain access to that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m04s)

[data if it's encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m06s)

[ideally no they shouldn't be able to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m09s)

[break the encryption to get it out but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m11s)

[if it's unencrypted all bets are off](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m12s)

[right like i i remember um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m15s)

[when i was when i was very young very](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m18s)

[little um i would do um kind of on the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m20s)

[side computer work for people and quite](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m23s)

[often people would have issues where you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m26s)

[know they they locked themselves out of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m28s)

[their computer they they were sending it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m30s)

[off or something had gone wrong it had](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m32s)

[crashed and they're like oh but you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m34s)

[i didn't back up my my precious pictures](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m36s)

[of my dogs i need you to save those that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m38s)

[kind of thing um and one of the simplest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m40s)

[things i did is i spent 10 bucks bought](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m42s)

[a simple little wire that you plugged](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m45s)

[into the hard drive connected up to a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m47s)

[usb port and then i just copied all the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m49s)

[data off why because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m51s)

[uh at least back in like the windows xp](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m53s)

[and earlier days data was almost never](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m56s)

[encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m58s)

[and it meant that i could plug in that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h39m59s)

[hard drive and pull all the data off now](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m01s)

[with like bitlocker and that kind of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m04s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m05s)

[oftentimes data is now encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m07s)

[and it's not as easy to be able to just](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m09s)

[back door into that hard drive and grab](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m12s)

[it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m14s)

[going back to your question is it okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m15s)

[to keep data unencrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m18s)

[i would say not if it can be avoided](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m20s)

[uh so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m25s)

[most of the time and especially in a lot](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m26s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m29s)

[cloud-based services you'll note that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m30s)

[they will typically advertise when the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m34s)

[data is encrypted at rest because that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m36s)

[is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m38s)

[very much an advanced kind of selling](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m39s)

[feature type thing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m42s)

[yeah i would say i would say is it okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m45s)

[to keep data encrypted at rest and i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m47s)

[would say](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m49s)

[not if there's an alternative](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m50s)

[if if there is any possibility of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m52s)

[ensuring that data is encrypted at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m55s)

[and that doesn't necessarily mean](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h40m57s)

[you encrypt it inside of your software](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m00s)

[um oftentimes like i said in a lot of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m02s)

[like the the sas type solutions](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m06s)

[it will handle it for you uh of doing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m08s)

[that that encryption](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m13s)

[using like either the machine key or](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m14s)

[whatnot in order to do that so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m16s)

[those types of things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m19s)

[typically should be transparent to you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m20s)

[as a software developer](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m23s)

[but if you can avoid keeping it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m26s)

[unencrypted](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m28s)

[definitely do so there's there's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m29s)

[definitely horror stories on hacker news](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m31s)

[and whatnot where](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m33s)

[you know something was left unencrypted](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m35s)

[at rest](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m37s)

[you know some server was you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m38s)

[decommissioned you know but left running](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m40s)

[didn't get updates got compromised](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m43s)

[somebody stripped off you know this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m45s)

[database and you see all those data](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m47s)

[breaches where it's like oh yes if you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m49s)

[were our customer eight and a half years](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m50s)

[compromised great](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m55s)

[thanks guys where where did you leave my](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h41m58s)

[data unencrypted somewhere because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h42m00s)

[that's typically what that means](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h42m02s)

[good questions robert](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h42m10s)

[you've seriously distracted me](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h42m13s)

[so especially loading up all of this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m28s)

[information and the the speed of which](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m30s)

[because you can imagine the the number](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m33s)

[of queries and whatnot that go into here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m34s)

[there's quite a few governments even](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m36s)

[that he's gotten um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m38s)

[set up uh for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m41s)

[for basically checking so like in a lot](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m43s)

[of cases if you go to like log into one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m46s)

[of your accounts and says hey by the way](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m48s)

[this account's been compromised](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m50s)

[oftentimes they're using a service](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m51s)

[probably not unlike this right going](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m54s)

[through his api](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m56s)

[for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m57s)

[um getting who's using it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h43m58s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m24s)

[remarkably good and all this does is if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m26s)

[they](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m29s)

[if he ends up receiving a data breach](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m30s)

[that contains your information you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m33s)

[here's a link you know you can come in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m37s)

[and see the data breach he obviously](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m39s)

[doesn't publicize out like the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m41s)

[the the breach passwords and whatnot but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m44s)

[it lets you know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m47s)

[that that was exposed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m48s)

[and the types of data that was exposed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m51s)

[and you should immediately go and change](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h44m53s)

[notified](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m01s)

[of a breach and an attack against one of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m03s)

[my emails on my wedding day](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m05s)

[be dealing with somebody trying to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m10s)

[because it was i i got the notification](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m12s)

[from have i been pwned](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m14s)

[like early that morning or something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m16s)

[and then later that day because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m19s)

[obviously i'm prepping for a wedding i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m21s)

[am not paying attention to email](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m23s)

[requests for my email and i went i'm](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m28s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m33s)

[that was uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m34s)

[that was not good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m35s)

[uh he](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m37s)

[uh ashley](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m38s)

[i know he changed things up with the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m40s)

[whole ashley madison breach i am not](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m41s)

[familiar with that story](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m43s)

[what got changed up i know he's added](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m45s)

[plenty of stuff](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m47s)

[um in here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m48s)

[but like you can see some of the the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m51s)

[recently added ones that when he ingests](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m53s)

[data it's it's not exactly small numbers](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h45m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m00s)

[but you can go in here and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m02s)

[and search for your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m04s)

[your emails or your domains of that kind](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m06s)

[of thing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m09s)

[oh right because that was the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m12s)

[that was the breach where](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m14s)

[people were not wanting their data](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m16s)

[shared for obvious reasons](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m18s)

[got it yeah](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m28s)

[yeah but definitely so one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m33s)

[i would recommend signing up for this uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m36s)

[this notify imei and and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m38s)

[even if you don't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m42s)

[periodically just you know give a quick](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m43s)

[check to see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m45s)

[um the better thing to do by all means](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m47s)

[one turn on two-factor auth everywhere](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m50s)

[you possibly can hint netflix i want to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m52s)

[factor off](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m56s)

[uh and where you can't a password](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h46m59s)

[manager is wonderful because then if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m01s)

[an account gets compromised it's a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m05s)

[single account with a single password](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m07s)

[obviously if that's an email there's the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m08s)

[potential for that to to spiral a little](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m10s)

[bit bigger but at least making sure](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m12s)

[you know that you you limit the scope of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m16s)

[it um for people familiar with the icons](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m19s)

[you can see in the corner here i favor](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m21s)

[bit warden it's a it's a nice one that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m23s)

[that is free um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m26s)

[and it uh at least under the free tier i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m28s)

[can share uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m31s)

[passwords with my wife back and forth](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m33s)

[which is wonderful that way when i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m35s)

[change the netflix password she doesn't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m37s)

[have to come questioning what it is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m44s)

[what would be one you recommend so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m45s)

[i personally use bitwarden but there are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m48s)

[lots of good ones out there last pass](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m50s)

[i've used in the past and it is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m52s)

[it is an excellent one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m56s)

[yeah i would say pick one that pick one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h47m59s)

[that works well for you um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m01s)

[i and a lot of them have like either um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m03s)

[like family family tiers or that kind of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m07s)

[thing and they're they're definitely](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m09s)

[worthwhile if you have a bunch of people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m10s)

[in your household that you need to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m12s)

[i will say securely share credentials](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m14s)

[with obviously sharing credentials is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m17s)

[typically a no-no](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m19s)

[like you don't give your password to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m21s)

[somebody however for example](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m23s)

[the netflix password at my house is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m26s)

[available to both my wife and i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m28s)

[that is a very reasonable thing right um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m30s)

[you share the netflix password yes but i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m35s)

[share with other people in the household](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m37s)

[which i believe is still within the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m40s)

[terms of use](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m41s)

[we we still only have like two machines](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m43s)

[that that access netflix it's the the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m45s)

[computer and then the uh the tv](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m49s)

[downstairs can i move in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m51s)

[robert i am not adding you to my bit](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m54s)

[warden organization](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h48m56s)

[but i would definitely say](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m00s)

[whatever password manager you go with um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m02s)

[i would suggest picking one of the main](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m06s)

[ones that also has](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m08s)

[a mobile integration so a mobile app](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m10s)

[that you can use because it is an](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m13s)

[absolutely metric pain in the butt if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m16s)

[you've got a nice secure password](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m18s)

[generated by your password manager and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m20s)

[then you pick up your phone and you have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m22s)

[to try and type that sucker in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m23s)

[that's miserable don't do that so pick a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m27s)

[re pick any of the reasonable password](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m30s)

[managers that also have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m32s)

[um mobile integration](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m35s)

[so that you can use it on your phone as](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m37s)

[well as your thing it's also really](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m40s)

[helpful for when it comes time to say](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m42s)

[you need to cycle a password because you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m44s)

[get that unfortunate email that says hey](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m46s)

[by the way this account's been](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m48s)

[compromised or heaven forbid i'm still](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m50s)

[trying to get some family members from](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m52s)

[doing this that you you know you use the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m54s)

[same password for multiple things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m56s)

[and then that password gets compromised](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h49m58s)

[you now have to change all the things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m00s)

[and most of the time people don't that's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m03s)

[bad that's very very very bad so i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m05s)

[encourage you password manager um all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m08s)

[the password managers are going to have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m11s)

[some sort of like master key to unlock](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m13s)

[the vault](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m15s)

[this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m16s)

[should not be a short password password](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m17s)

[complexity goes up significantly with](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m20s)

[length over complexity so some people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m22s)

[get really fancy with like you know i'll](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m25s)

[replace letters with symbols and numbers](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m26s)

[and that kind of thing that's good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m28s)

[but the the number of permutations](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m30s)

[goes up more by just adding another](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m34s)

[letter or symbol on to the end then um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m37s)

[then just adding complexity don't waste](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m41s)

[time with complexity go long i recommend](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m44s)

[sentences](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m46s)

[they don't even have to be things that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m48s)

[make sense](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m49s)

[but just like a some a sentence or a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m51s)

[phrase or something that you can](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m54s)

[remember or](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m56s)

[whatever right like that is perfect you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h50m58s)

[can throw some numbers and symbols in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m00s)

[there and have fun with it but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m02s)

[something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m04s)

[long is good because remember your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m05s)

[password manager vault password should](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m07s)

[be used only there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m09s)

[never shared](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m11s)

[that should be under lock and key don't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m13s)

[don't lose that because um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m15s)

[yeah like robert says rainbow tables can](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m19s)

[cover most passwords up to like length](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m22s)

[15 or something ridiculous right so for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m24s)

[people unfamiliar with rainbow tables](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m26s)

[they're basically um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m28s)

[so how passwords work is you type in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m31s)

[your password it runs it through a hash](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m33s)

[algorithm and then it compares that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m35s)

[output hash with the stored one to see](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m37s)

[if it's correct or not](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m39s)

[most hashing algorithms are slow by](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m40s)

[design](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m43s)

[because if you're able to hash a lot of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m44s)

[things quickly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m47s)

[it means that you can brute force your](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m48s)

[way through a lot of things the problem](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m50s)

[is there there's a lot of time involved](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m52s)

[in that rainbow tables are basically um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h51m54s)

[yes yes i will take it i did learn](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m42s)

[something though once you break that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m45s)

[seal on the two liter](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m47s)

[it has a very finite shelf life after](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m48s)

[about like three or four weeks](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m51s)

[it will go bad once that seal is broken](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m57s)

[once you once you crack them out and do](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h58m58s)

[you should you should consume it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m00s)

[somewhat quickly like i'd say under a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m02s)

[week now me usually a mountain dew once](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m05s)

[it's cracked it's not gonna last a week](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m08s)

[it's lucky if it lasts the day](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m10s)

[i i usually don't have it sitting that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m14s)

[long but when somebody else had cracked](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m15s)

[it it was on a shelf life so there was a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m17s)

[time where i did have to throw away some](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m19s)

[dew because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m21s)

[yeah it goes bad](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m23s)

[does not taste good does not taste good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m27s)

[at all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m29s)

[and you know when it's going bad because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m30s)

[it'll first start to get like a really](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m32s)

[watery flavor](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m34s)

[and what comes after the watery flavor](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m35s)

[tastes like mold](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m37s)

[and then you should stop](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m39s)

[like once you get to that watery point](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m42s)

[that's like the last possible point](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m43s)

[where it's kind of okay to drink](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m45s)

[and then you should be throwing it away](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m48s)

[theming brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=00h59m54s)

[through and start updating](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m08s)

[the library i was actually contemplating](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m12s)

[going through and putting in a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m14s)

[hacktoberfest to see if somebody wants](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m18s)

[to write me a powershell script to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m20s)

[automatically update people's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m21s)

[code because it's actually not terribly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m24s)

[difficult to just go hunting through the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m26s)

[xaml for all of somebody's like dynamic](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m29s)

[resources and just replace the keys](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m32s)

[it's most of the most these updates](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m35s)

[should be that simple so i imagine a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m37s)

[powershell script could be a really good](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m39s)

[90 solution from](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m41s)

[maybe even 100 for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m46s)

[okay so underneath this new i started](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m50s)

[putting all the new stuff underneath](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m53s)

[this new theming namespace and so you'll](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m54s)

[know there is a lot of duplication](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m57s)

[between this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h00m59s)

[and the stuff over here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m00s)

[that i started tacking the word obsolete](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m02s)

[onto the files for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m04s)

[for what it's worth](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m07s)

[oh and i'll i'll actually throw this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m11s)

[this option out there as well i i put a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m12s)

[a thing out to a couple of my colleagues](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m15s)

[but i i will extend it out as well if](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m17s)

[anybody is interested in doing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m20s)

[um hacktoberfest and you would you would](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m23s)

[like to do](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m26s)

[you'd like to earn the t-shirt you want](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m27s)

[to get your prs in and you don't know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m29s)

[where to start if you are interested in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m30s)

[pairing with me on a live stream you can](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m33s)

[pick the repo preferably c sharp don't](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m35s)

[care which one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m38s)

[um i will pair with you to help you get](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m39s)

[your prs in and get them submitted and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m42s)

[and done so you can earn a t-shirt for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m45s)

[hacktoberfest so if that is interesting](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m47s)

[to anybody again you have to be willing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m49s)

[to pair with me on stream and preferably](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m52s)

[pick a c sharpie repo](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m54s)

[and i will pair with you and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m56s)

[we'll knock we'll knock out four pr's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h01m58s)

[i imagine in an evening and you can earn](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m02s)

[your shirt](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m04s)

[that'd be fun](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m05s)

[because i intend to have my pr's done in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m08s)

[probably the next 24 hours](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m11s)

[and if not the next 24 hours this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m13s)

[weekend](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m17s)

[because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m18s)

[my wife is leaving me home alone with](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m21s)

[the kids](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m23s)

[for the weekend so i imagine this the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m24s)

[evenings after they go to bed i will](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m26s)

[probably be submitting pr's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m28s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m31s)

[lightly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m36s)

[okay so this is the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m38s)

[this method here that i've buried](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m40s)

[underneath this theme manager is one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m42s)

[that i've](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m44s)

[i've built to convert from the old i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m45s)

[theme into the new theme class](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m47s)

[and so it's also serving as a convenient](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m49s)

[mapping so if anybody wants to know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m53s)

[what's the old name into the new name](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m55s)

[this method](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m57s)

[um i'm basically using as a place of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h02m58s)

[keeping track of it it's also how i'm](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m03s)

[going to make](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m05s)

[both of them work](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m07s)

[on their own](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m09s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m11s)

[both theming approaches can be there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m13s)

[there's a there's a couple things going](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m16s)

[on right now right now the old theme](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m18s)

[manager calls into the new theme manager](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m20s)

[from one into the next which is great](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m22s)

[except for it's a one-way street the old](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m25s)

[one calls the new one but as soon as you](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m28s)

[update to the new one the old brush](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m30s)

[names are going to stop working](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m31s)

[so i want to fix that before i release](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m34s)

[as well because](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m36s)

[that i want people to be able to switch](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m38s)

[incrementally and by saying oh you have](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m41s)

[to do all these things then switch that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m43s)

[just sounds like a recipe for disaster](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m44s)

[but i've gotten it down to the point](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m47s)

[where there's only a handful of brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m48s)

[left these two i think i'm going to kill](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m51s)

[off completely the divider and the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m53s)

[selection brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m55s)

[in favor of making some specific ones to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h03m57s)

[each](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m00s)

[each control like you can see i've](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m01s)

[already started separating things for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m03s)

[here's some data grid brushes here's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m05s)

[some drawer hose brushes and making](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m07s)

[these things specific](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m09s)

[to those](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m11s)

[so that if there is a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m12s)

[if somebody does want to make something](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m15s)

[more customizable in the future it's](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m16s)

[hopefully more obvious](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m18s)

[where that brush goes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m20s)

[and how that gets built out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m21s)

[so last night i believe the buttons are](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m23s)

[where i left off and so i was going to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m27s)

[start with whatever control comes after](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m29s)

[the word button](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m31s)

[which apparently is calendar](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m36s)

[we are just going to start running](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m39s)

[through these things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m42s)

[dynamic resource](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m44s)

[and here we go so most of these get to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m47s)

[be pretty simple and you the the best](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m50s)

[part material design](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m52s)

[you'll note](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m56s)

[i can now get nice intellisense and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m57s)

[because of the naming](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h04m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m01s)

[it filters down where i'm going so i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m02s)

[want](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m04s)

[primary](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m05s)

[done and then if i want the foreground](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m07s)

[for that one primary dot](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m10s)

[foreground oh look at that i can even](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m12s)

[remember my brush names](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m14s)

[isn't that wonderful](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m16s)

[okay next next next](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m18s)

[okay and this is the one that always](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m21s)

[bothered me is i could never remember](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m23s)

[the difference between body and paper in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m25s)

[this case it's clearly](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m26s)

[background and foreground](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m30s)

[background](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m32s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m37s)

[no thinking](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m40s)

[muchas better](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m42s)

[much is better](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m43s)

[at least my opinion is much better](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m46s)

[um but these are still](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m48s)

[very much up for](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m52s)

[um debate](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m54s)

[so if that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m57s)

[um so if you have strong opinions about](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h05m58s)

[what makes sense or what these things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m01s)

[should be named please feel free to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m03s)

[leave feedback](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m09s)

[this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m10s)

[is wrong we're gonna fix that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m11s)

[you don't do styles as dynamic resources](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m15s)

[because those should be resolved once](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m18s)

[and not dynamically](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m21s)

[this is one of those cases where i'm](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m25s)

[tempted to make this into a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m28s)

[control specific brush but i don't think](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m30s)

[i'm going to i think for now i'm going](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m32s)

[to leave these things](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m34s)

[using the ones that they were doing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m36s)

[before](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m37s)

[um but i do want to start separating](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m42s)

[some of these ones out and creating new](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m44s)

[ones thankfully creating new brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m46s)

[later is not a breaking change](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m48s)

[um there's a couple things that i very](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m52s)

[intentionally did and this is actually](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m55s)

[worth calling out so you'll note that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m57s)

[the old class was a](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h06m59s)

[an interface this eye theme](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m03s)

[and the unfortunate part with it being](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m06s)

[an interface is an addition](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m08s)

[would be a breaking change which sucks](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m10s)

[i don't want that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m15s)

[oh oops](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m18s)

[sealed](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m20s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m23s)

[oh i can't make you sealed can i](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m24s)

[oh that's right](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m28s)

[that's right i wanted to seal this class](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m30s)

[so that nobody could inherit from it but](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m32s)

[what i did do is i made the constructor](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m34s)

[internal because there are a couple](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m37s)

[dried class and then i sealed the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m39s)

[derived classes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m41s)

[just to make them easy and i still need](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m45s)

[to move all of these things up here and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m47s)

[have them set the appropriate brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m50s)

[and all of that jazz](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m51s)

[haven't done that yet haven't done it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m53s)

[yet i've got i've got to do's all over](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h07m58s)

[code base it is it is currently a mess](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m00s)

[so this is going to be a very big](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m03s)

[change and so i'm likely to merge this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m06s)

[in and then let it sit for a while in](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m08s)

[the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m11s)

[the preview releases because i know](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m12s)

[we've got several users that pull down](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m14s)

[the preview nougat packages and try them](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m16s)

[out](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m18s)

[and i'd like to get feedback from people](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m19s)

[if there's any breakages because this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m21s)

[should work](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m23s)

[without](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m24s)

[without breaking everybody](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m25s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m29s)

[should](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m30s)

[should work if it doesn't it's a bug and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m31s)

[we should fix it okay so there's that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m34s)

[there's that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m38s)

[okay and calendar's done](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h08m41s)

[to the divider](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m02s)

[so we are on chip outline](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m15s)

[and we are also only on the chip outline](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m18s)

[when we are checked](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m21s)

[so let's go and make a new one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m23s)

[so that's basically the way i've been](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m37s)

[handling this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m39s)

[come over here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m57s)

[so it needs to be done now in three](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h14m59s)

[places so the conversion from the old](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h15m00s)

[should these be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m37s)

[theme brushes](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m39s)

[okay because we now have a spot where we](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m42s)

[could put these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m45s)

[i i suspect the answer is yes but right](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m49s)

[now we are not](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h38m52s)

[and this is another case where i want to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m02s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m06s)

[so there's got at least one usage of](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m09s)

[check box disabled](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m11s)

[second usage so this is](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m15s)

[one was set on the down arrow on the](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h39m17s)

[that's what the old one was](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h40m59s)

[forward that one in but obviously we](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h41m02s)

[don't propagate the wet](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h41m04s)

[rewatch that video every so often](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h41m41s)

[that one's fine](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h42m54s)

[let's see okay so material design paper](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h42m56s)

[this is one i think we can do a find and](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h42m58s)

[replace on](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m01s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m04s)

[paper is background](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m09s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m34s)

[this is using the text box](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m36s)

[inactive order so i think we're going to](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m40s)

[propagate this onto a new](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m42s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m45s)

[yeah because there's a there's a lot](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m50s)

[shared between various controls](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h43m52s)

[of those controls kind of have this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m08s)

[common](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m09s)

[i've got a box i can type into portion](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m10s)

[of them](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m12s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m17s)

[but i don't want them necessarily](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m18s)

[sharing](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m21s)

[a brush name they can share brush look](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m22s)

[but not a brush name](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m24s)

[so text inactive border so what did we](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m26s)

[call the one on text box](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m33s)

[outline inactive border and i assume](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m36s)

[that's what this one is as well](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m38s)

[is the outline style right](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m41s)

[has outline field true so yes so i want](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m45s)

[to add that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m48s)

[to combo box](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m50s)

[outline in active border](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h44m55s)

[back to the top](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m05s)

[outline in active border and this](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m08s)

[initially came from](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m11s)

[text area inactive border](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m23s)

[that goes like that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m25s)

[come down to the next one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m36s)

[change that one over](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m40s)

[and let's see combo box](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m45s)

[outline inactive border](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m54s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m56s)

[in active border goes there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h45m57s)

[okay so actually we should probably just](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m00s)

[grab that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m03s)

[string on here](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m04s)

[that is going to go in place there](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m07s)

[uh validation airbrush](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m15s)

[i believe this is another one](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m19s)

[that can be auto replaced](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m28s)

[let me double check](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m32s)

[yeah so that one can be replaced with](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m35s)

[that](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m39s)

[so we can do a find replace all on these](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m42s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m46s)

[and this one is going to be](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m48s)

[that brush](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m52s)

[place all](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h46m58s)

[put either of those down](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h47m03s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h47m07s)

[that one's done that one's done](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h47m09s)

[material design body i thought i did](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h47m12s)

[this one already did i not](https://youtu.be/gb6TC3APpZg?t=01h47m14s)
