[Hello everybody welcome back tonight we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m01s)

[are going to dive into a topic that is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m04s)

[near and dear to my heart testing and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m05s)

[more importantly testing with a couple](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m08s)

[libraries that I enjoy using quite a bit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m09s)

[Mock and autom marer uh just full](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m12s)

[disclosure autom marer is a library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m14s)

[where I'm also one of the maintainers on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m16s)

[it I'm not the soul maintainer there's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m18s)

[few other people on there as well um but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m19s)

[I do definitely contribute to it so if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m22s)

[we get time I was going to dive in and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m24s)

[also show some of the upcoming new](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m26s)

[features that are forthcoming in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m28s)

[next one hey Andrew welcome always good](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m30s)

[to have you so we will be we will be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m33s)

[poking at that and then also I'm going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m35s)

[to spend a bit of time focusing on auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m37s)

[marer its usage I've been uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m39s)

[professionally using it with more and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m42s)

[more teams and often times unfortunately](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m44s)

[our documentation sucks so this is going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m46s)

[to be V1 of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m48s)

[documentation of at least having a a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m51s)

[section of video that I can point people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m53s)

[to and say hey here is a section on auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m55s)

[marer if you're curious what it is is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h00m58s)

[why it works let's go ahead and do that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m00s)

[so let's dive in so I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m03s)

[dump a bunch of links right out the gate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m06s)

[right so I'm starting from one of my net](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m08s)

[templates so if you want to follow along](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m11s)

[at home that's that one um the mocking](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m13s)

[library of choice here is going to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m16s)

[mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m18s)

[mq uh there are plenty of mocking](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m19s)

[libraries out there for theet space a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m22s)

[lot of them out there uh pick your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m25s)

[favorite uh I will warn you the autom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m27s)

[marker live that I'm going to show off](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m29s)

[is very much uh specific to uh mock mq](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m31s)

[there are similar libraries uh from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m38s)

[other people out there as well that do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m40s)

[something similar so I will show you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m43s)

[what all is in Auto marker and some of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m45s)

[the things that maybe start to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m48s)

[differentiate it from some of the other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m50s)

[ones and then you know you can take your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m52s)

[pick and then finally I don't know why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m54s)

[that thing has the tab up like that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m57s)

[we're going to just trim that off uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h01m59s)

[Auto marcker and look there's me yay me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m01s)

[and there's my colleague Adam yay Adam](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m05s)

[okay um I can't I can't cheer him too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m07s)

[much he might let it go to his](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m10s)

[head okay so starting off this is my my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m12s)

[default uh cabo. WPF uh. net new](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m17s)

[template I didn't do anything fancy I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m21s)

[can show you the terminal I literally](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m24s)

[just ran net new Off to the Races right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m25s)

[great fine um it goes it spits out a WPF](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m28s)

[app we can launch it if we care to see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m33s)

[it real quick it's it's nothing overly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m35s)

[special but it's just significant enough](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m39s)

[to actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m42s)

[matter should have compiled it ahead of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m45s)

[time there we go right there's a button](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m47s)

[you can click it you can clear the count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m49s)

[you can click the button again huzzah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m51s)

[there's there's some stuff in here it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m54s)

[all works great that's that's what we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m55s)

[want to see in a sample something small](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h02m57s)

[enough that it makes sense but big](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m00s)

[enough to where we can actually do it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m01s)

[and there are some tests already in here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m03s)

[for this view model we are not going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m05s)

[currently use them because they kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m09s)

[cheat and Skip ahead um and so I figure](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m11s)

[we will go through and do this I also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m14s)

[just installed the latest vs preview and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m16s)

[there's this cool little feature up at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m18s)

[the top where it shows you where you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m19s)

[at I think I like it I I think I like it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m21s)

[I'm not sure but I think I like it it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m25s)

[kind of nice to be able to like always](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m28s)

[keep a little bit of context about what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m30s)

[what you're inside of or where you're at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m31s)

[without needing to scroll up so it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m33s)

[kind of cool okay so we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m35s)

[start off we're going to add a new](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m37s)

[class uh let's go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m41s)

[with example](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m44s)

[test yeah it is it it does take a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m48s)

[of adjustment and I I run way too many](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m51s)

[of the preview features and so I I was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m53s)

[actually bit earlier this week showing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m57s)

[off some features to to somebody and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h03m59s)

[then they fired up their visual studio](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m01s)

[and didn't have the same features and we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m02s)

[went what what turns out it was a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m04s)

[preview feature and I I just assumed it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m07s)

[was normal so I get I get a little too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m10s)

[adjusted to preview mode like the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m12s)

[preview visual studio is great anyone](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m14s)

[can go out and download it um it does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m16s)

[come like I should say it's great about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m20s)

[95% of the time the other 5% of the time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m22s)

[make me question why I'm running preview](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m25s)

[and want to go back to the you know the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m27s)

[actual release one but most of the time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m28s)

[the preview builds are just fine they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m31s)

[aren't they aren't that bad I even run](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m33s)

[them in my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m35s)

[day-to-day okay so we are going to start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m36s)

[here I am going to start with the what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m38s)

[of testing and then we are going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m41s)

[circle back to the why because the why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m42s)

[often elicits a lot more discussion and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m45s)

[I've found that starting with what um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m48s)

[ends up making things a little bit nicer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m51s)

[so in general I would uh strongly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m53s)

[Advocate that your test class you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m56s)

[usually should mirror the thing that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h04m59s)

[they're testing so you'll hear people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m01s)

[use the word uh s dang co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m03s)

[seriously yes thank you co-pilot I was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m07s)

[looking to define the acronym you show](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m10s)

[off uh s is an acronym that stands for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m12s)

[system under test and if you ever forget](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m14s)

[that apparently you can just type this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m17s)

[in and apparently co-pilot is just fine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m18s)

[copilot you want to do everything for me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m21s)

[that's n unit like I don't know where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m23s)

[you think you're going with this yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m25s)

[yeah shut up co-pilot I'm the program](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m27s)

[thank you very much no no we're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m30s)

[doing that um I am going to point out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m32s)

[just the the packages that I do have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m35s)

[installed mq uh and the automach library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m37s)

[I will be using xunit for this uh you do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m41s)

[not have to pick your unit testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m43s)

[library of choice but please pick xunit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m45s)

[nunit or Ms test like there's really not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m48s)

[a reason to pick anything else but one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m50s)

[of those three like if you're in the big](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m53s)

[three you're probably fine um I also am](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m56s)

[going to to point out I do have some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h05m59s)

[Global using setup so you will not see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m00s)

[most using statements show up at the top](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m03s)

[because I've got Global usings defined](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m06s)

[here and we are off to the races okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m09s)

[uh let's talk about uh what we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m13s)

[to test here so the easiest thing to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m15s)

[through and test is the commands on this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m17s)

[view model and in particular this thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m19s)

[has a command called increment count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m22s)

[command uh in case you missed it uh last](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m25s)

[week's stream was on community toolkit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m28s)

[with avalonia um I cover a little bit of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m31s)

[this but this is Source generated so you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m33s)

[can see there is increment count command](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m35s)

[is in fact a property that exists on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m38s)

[this instance you just don't see it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m41s)

[because the attribute is triggering a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m43s)

[source](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m45s)

[generator so we're going to start there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m45s)

[and we're just going to validate that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m48s)

[this command behaves uh as we expect](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m49s)

[uh uh yeah this stuff there's not going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m54s)

[to be a lot of WPF spefic specific stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h06m57s)

[a a tad mvvm because part of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m00s)

[motivation for why you build an app with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m03s)

[mvvm is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m05s)

[testability there there's there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m06s)

[several B bonuses to it but one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m08s)

[big ones is the separation of concerns](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m11s)

[allows you to write tests and if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m14s)

[don't need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m17s)

[tests then like you you've given up a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m20s)

[big portion of what mvvm gets you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m23s)

[so not complet it's not like you're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m26s)

[getting any benefit but you're giving up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m28s)

[a a big chunk of it okay so increment](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m30s)

[count command increments the count so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m33s)

[we're going to start with this so fact](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m35s)

[and then co-pilot's going to write the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m37s)

[whole thing for me public void uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m39s)

[increment count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m43s)

[command uh on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m45s)

[execute and actually I'm G to I'm going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m48s)

[to do this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m50s)

[uh increments count and I can't spell so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m54s)

[hopefully I got that mostly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h07m59s)

[correct okay so co-pilot's immediately](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m00s)

[showing the fact that it's an AI and not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m03s)

[a real boy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m05s)

[so uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m07s)

[set gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m09s)

[new and actually you know setting the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m12s)

[count initially is probably not a bad](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m14s)

[idea okay co-pilot I gave you the name](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m16s)

[of the test can't you write it ah take](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m18s)

[that co-pilot getting line](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m22s)

[AI uh nope still wrong co-pilot still](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m25s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m28s)

[I'll come back to that null in a minute](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m31s)

[and then assert thank you that much you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m33s)

[got right so there is a common pattern](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m35s)

[in unit testing that is worth knowing it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m37s)

[is called](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m39s)

[arrange uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m41s)

[act uh and assert and and really what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m44s)

[this comes down to is for the arrange](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m47s)

[por you do whatever setup is needed for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m49s)

[your test the ACT portion is generally](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m52s)

[supposed to be very small and logically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m55s)

[one thing for your act portion you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h08m58s)

[really want it to be one logical thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m00s)

[I'm not saying one line of code or one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m03s)

[method invocation or that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m05s)

[because that that's a little too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m07s)

[dogmatic and there's cases where that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m09s)

[doesn't work but one logical thing and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m10s)

[then finally any relevant assertions and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m13s)

[in this case there is only kind of one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m16s)

[thing for us](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m17s)

[to uh assert on the other thing to note](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m19s)

[is I usually tell people name your test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m23s)

[methods with these three things in mind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m26s)

[right often times I will name my test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m29s)

[method you know we'll do this uh method](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m32s)

[name uh stop it co-pilot right uh so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m37s)

[here we're going to do this I'm G to see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m42s)

[if I can get this uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m43s)

[act](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m48s)

[arrange assert something like that and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m52s)

[in this case it's a little awkward](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m55s)

[because the the arrange change doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h09m57s)

[really exist in this case right because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m00s)

[in this case uh on execute I don't know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m02s)

[with set count we could do so we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m07s)

[argue that that might be a little more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m09s)

[clear and then assert and really when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m11s)

[you name your test like this one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m13s)

[things that it gives](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m15s)

[you uh is it gives you a check sum or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m17s)

[some level of validation that somebody](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m20s)

[reading your test can validate does the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m22s)

[contents of the Test match the name and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m25s)

[hopefully this is something that's done](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m27s)

[on code review is does the test name](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m28s)

[make sense if I read the name of your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m31s)

[test do I know without looking at the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m32s)

[contents what I expect that test to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m35s)

[doing right like in theory if I Collapse](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m37s)

[your test down like this can I you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m40s)

[look at your your thing here and again](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m42s)

[pretend like this says main window view](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m44s)

[model test I just can't name it that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m46s)

[because I've got an existing one pretend](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m48s)

[like that's what it says and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m51s)

[increment uh count command Okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m54s)

[that's that's what we're testing is this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m57s)

[command great uh on execute and actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h10m59s)

[maybe it should really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m02s)

[be something like that uh with set count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m04s)

[so I know that there's going to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m08s)

[something setting an a count as part of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m09s)

[this test and then the expectation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m11s)

[increments count okay so I can see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m14s)

[there's my ACT there's my arrange](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m18s)

[there's my assert We're Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m20s)

[and usually when people show testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m22s)

[this is kind of the the pattern they go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m24s)

[with and then often times they stop this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m26s)

[is horrible okay now we're going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m28s)

[make this more complicated we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m31s)

[write more tests around this we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m32s)

[say well you know there's a can execute](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m34s)

[we should validate that the can execute](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m36s)

[of the command you know returns false](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m38s)

[once we get to five and that kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m40s)

[thing great we're going to call that an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m42s)

[exercise for the reader I trust most](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m44s)

[people can extrapolate from here up to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m46s)

[that let's go and actually do something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m48s)

[slightly more complicated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m50s)

[though okay so we're gonna we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m52s)

[to come in here and we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m54s)

[pretend that we're going to add you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m55s)

[uh public interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h11m57s)

[I web service all right uh let's see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m00s)

[task of string uh get data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m05s)

[async right so we're GNA we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m11s)

[pretend like we've got this web service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m13s)

[thing uh yeah go aad and move it great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m15s)

[thanks you're D okay public class uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m18s)

[my web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m24s)

[service my web service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m26s)

[and we're going to go through and do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m29s)

[this Implement interface and in this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m31s)

[case what we're going to do is await Tas](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m34s)

[delay of time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m37s)

[span from seconds 10 oh I just realized](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m40s)

[something I missed the most important](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m45s)

[thing return hello oh yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m47s)

[thank you copilot you're awesome I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m50s)

[should have probably pointed out running](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m51s)

[of the test that is probably very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m53s)

[important so one once you compile](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m55s)

[the project and full disclosure I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h12m59s)

[running a I believe is it pro or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m02s)

[Enterprise that I have I don't remember](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m05s)

[Enterprise so just going to caution some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m08s)

[features I'm going to show you may not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m12s)

[have if you don't have a high enough](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m14s)

[skew just going to throw that out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m15s)

[there's at least one I'm about to show](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m17s)

[that I that I know is not in the lower](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m19s)

[SKS but worth knowing about so uh from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m21s)

[the menu up at the top uh test Explorer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m24s)

[is your friend](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m27s)

[we'll drag this guy back on over boom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m29s)

[this guy here will often go through and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m32s)

[show you all of your tests huzzah um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m34s)

[kind of some key things to know about up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m37s)

[here is the the group buy which is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m39s)

[incredibly helpful sometimes people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m42s)

[forget that you can actually group tests](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m44s)

[by different things specifically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m46s)

[depending on your testing framework](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m48s)

[there is ways to group things by trait](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m50s)

[by duration is often times something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m53s)

[that people forget about I oftentimes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m55s)

[Will Group by duration when I'm annoyed](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m57s)

[at how long my pipeline takes and I want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h13m59s)

[to figure out why some of my tests are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m01s)

[long you sort by duration and then you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m03s)

[go that say okay who's the biggest](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m05s)

[offenders and then I'm going to start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m08s)

[chopping down the tree there right and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m10s)

[start going through so having this stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m12s)

[available so groupy button is your best](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m14s)

[friend these are just like expand](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m16s)

[collapse buttons they're useful whatever](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m18s)

[um and then you can also create playlist](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m21s)

[so if you decide you know what really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m24s)

[all we want to do is I want a right now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m25s)

[we're going to be ignoring the main](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m29s)

[window view model test I just want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m30s)

[focus on these we can just like add](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m31s)

[these guys to a playlist and now I've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m35s)

[got just my testing examples Linked In](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m37s)

[over here right and you've got your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m40s)

[little pencil button here or if you want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m42s)

[to uh hide or show different ones you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m44s)

[can say oh okay know now bring these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m47s)

[ones into my playlist](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m49s)

[too so we can we can pick these stuff up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m51s)

[the these guys up as we go come in great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m54s)

[we've got a nice simple thing big play](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m56s)

[button lets you execute uh the thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h14m59s)

[that's selected the thing that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m02s)

[selected is hierarchial so if you you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m04s)

[pick on one versus the run all button](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m06s)

[and there's obviously lots of different](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m09s)

[things in here I will also point out the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m10s)

[hot keys on here are really useful](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m13s)

[especially the repeat last run control](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m15s)

[RL this is very handy because quite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m17s)

[often you're iterating on a test rapidly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m20s)

[and kicking it off the other thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m22s)

[that's worth calling out in here is the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m24s)

[rightclick menu we being able the run](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m26s)

[test debug test often times I find these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m29s)

[ones are very useful these ones are also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m31s)

[contact sensitive so if you right click](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m35s)

[inside of a test run test is going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m37s)

[kick off this test if you right click up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m40s)

[here it's going to run all tests for the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m42s)

[class also quite helpful it's just kind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m45s)

[of quick and dirty and then if you've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m48s)

[got these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m49s)

[little hang on I don't have zoom it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m51s)

[running uh if you have these little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m55s)

[icons here these little guys are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h15m58s)

[clickable and you can go whoop and hit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m00s)

[run debug Etc um the difference between](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m03s)

[run and debug is the same as F5 versus](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m08s)

[control F5 up here when you're executing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m10s)

[it's do you want a debugger attx do you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m13s)

[want to stop at break points and that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m14s)

[kind of thing or do you just want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m16s)

[send it right and oftentimes with test I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m17s)

[just send it um last thing I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m20s)

[point out uh and this is probably one of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m23s)

[the best things ever is uh and I believe](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m26s)

[this is Enterprise skew only don't quote](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h16m29s)

[the live unit testing window looks](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h17m11s)

[remarkably similar once it gets going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h17m13s)

[say I right clicked and hit run but then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m06s)

[it didn't do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m09s)

[anything well yeah it's because it had](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m10s)

[it doesn't know how to handle when it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m14s)

[says start process the last thing that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m15s)

[worth calling out and the only other way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m18s)

[that I think is worth running tests uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m19s)

[running tests from a from the command](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m22s)

[net build all the things you get all the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m29s)

[stuff out huzzah huzzah okay enough](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m31s)

[about actually running test let's talk](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m35s)

[about actually doing tests so I'm going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m36s)

[to play with live unit testing on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m38s)

[because in my opinion it just makes life](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m40s)

[so much easier so much easier did I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m42s)

[close it I think I did dang](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m45s)

[it um one should leave the live unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m47s)

[testing window open but we'll go through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m50s)

[and see this so next thing we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m52s)

[to do is we are going to give ourself](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m55s)

[another relay Comm command uh relay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h19m57s)

[uh wow](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m03s)

[co-pilot that's pretty good you're an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m06s)

[idiot but that's pretty good okay so why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m08s)

[co-pilot's dumb is we don't want doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m12s)

[this type of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m15s)

[instantiation if if I were to see a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m16s)

[method like this in real code I would](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m18s)

[question what the point of the interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m20s)

[is because the usually the idea of an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m23s)

[interface is to establish a contract](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m26s)

[and if you're just going to instantiate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m30s)

[the instance right there this is like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m32s)

[buying you nothing like at all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m33s)

[like just kill the interface you don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m37s)

[need it right so we're but we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m39s)

[to actually make it useful because it it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m42s)

[will serve our](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m44s)

[purposes uh okay and then here uh create](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m45s)

[an assigned field add no check and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m50s)

[we're going to come over here we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m53s)

[going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m55s)

[here uh uh and then let's give ourselves](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h20m56s)

[somewhere to put](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m01s)

[it we'll do an observable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m02s)

[property uh private string data that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m06s)

[sounds](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m09s)

[great um we'll do something like data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m11s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m14s)

[data okay so now let's imagine we wanted](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m15s)

[to go through and actually do the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m18s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m20s)

[here this is where the separation of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m22s)

[concerns and the DI and the test and all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m25s)

[of this come together again if you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m28s)

[not going to write](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m30s)

[tests this type of structure adds a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m32s)

[level of complexity and IND direction](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m35s)

[that often make the code more difficult](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m38s)

[for somebody if you are not bothering to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m39s)

[write tests just straight new up your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m42s)

[service right here and do the work that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m44s)

[you need right you're doing a quick](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m46s)

[oneoff there's no point in all this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m47s)

[extra ceremony if you're not going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m50s)

[actually you know do the stuff that the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m52s)

[ceremon is intended to do uh okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m54s)

[we're going to go through web service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h21m58s)

[get data a sync it's going to pull back](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m00s)

[some data sign it to the property huzzah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m01s)

[right so we will come through here and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m04s)

[co-pilot I would like you to show off](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m06s)

[for me so public void uh what was the I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m08s)

[somewhat omit the arrange portion from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m38s)

[the name of my test because at this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m40s)

[point there there's not really much](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m42s)

[there right so we're going to go ahead](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m44s)

[and do uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m45s)

[arrange okay sure we can do some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m50s)

[expected](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m52s)

[data you're getting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m53s)

[closer okay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h22m59s)

[okay that's pretty good cop that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m05s)

[pretty good I almost had to think for a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m07s)

[minute okay so let's discuss what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m13s)

[co-pilot did because clearly co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m16s)

[has already figured out which end is up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m18s)

[um and we're just going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m21s)

[do mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m23s)

[of I web service and then this will be a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m25s)

[good introduction to Mock and a bunch of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m28s)

[its](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m30s)

[apis see test goes green huzzah we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m31s)

[should also validate hey co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m35s)

[validate that the mock was actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m37s)

[invoked validate the mock was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m40s)

[invoked do it thank you okay see we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m45s)

[don't write code anymore we write](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m50s)

[comments and we let the AI write the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m51s)

[code so with mock the idea here is to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m53s)

[test main window view model we need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h23m58s)

[something that is an ieb](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m00s)

[service now there's obviously a real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m03s)

[implementation that was written that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m05s)

[just going to return some hardcoded data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m06s)

[but for our purposes we can imagine that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m09s)

[this class might have an HTTP client](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m12s)

[it's probably going to do some work](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m14s)

[right it's going to take some some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m16s)

[amount of effort to go through and do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m18s)

[and really what we want to do and the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m20s)

[whole reason why we put in an interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m22s)

[rather than just using the concrete](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m24s)

[class is we said you know what what I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m25s)

[would really like to do is I would like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m28s)

[to be able to go through and put in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m30s)

[different implementation now we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m32s)

[write a you know a uh private](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m35s)

[class uh testing web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m38s)

[service I web service right we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m43s)

[build this whole thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m46s)

[up and often and you know we could make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m49s)

[this do whatever we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m51s)

[need uh don't be the graph ftic remove](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m54s)

[your interface well we're going to get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m58s)

[to deleting the interfaces in a moment](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h24m59s)

[so don't get too excited um so we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m02s)

[go through and build out one of these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m05s)

[things and we could have it you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m07s)

[return hello world and do all the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m08s)

[needful stuff the problem is is in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m10s)

[real app this starts to take a bit of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m12s)

[time especially if you're going to just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m14s)

[kind of put in worthless implementations](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m16s)

[that are things like return task](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m18s)

[from result you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m22s)

[know uh my result right if we were to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m26s)

[plug this in and say well okay rather](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m30s)

[than using the mock what we'd rather do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m32s)

[instead is we'd rather](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m34s)

[go we're g to just comment this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m35s)

[out wait did it do it for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m38s)

[me copilot if you're gon to start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m41s)

[ruining my examples I'm going to be okay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m44s)

[good I was worried you're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m46s)

[actually do the right thing like if it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m47s)

[can do the wrong code based upon what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m50s)

[I'm saying I'm going to be real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m51s)

[impressed uh right we could plug we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m53s)

[could plug something like this this in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m56s)

[right expected data now changes to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h25m58s)

[something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m00s)

[like my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m01s)

[result I think I want live unit testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m04s)

[it is awesome like absolutely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m07s)

[amazing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m11s)

[um and this is obviously not going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m13s)

[work because it's acting on the mock the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m16s)

[other thing it doesn't it's not quite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m18s)

[code coverage right it it gives you kind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m20s)

[of this line by line indication of what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m22s)

[was executed it's man's code coverage I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m26s)

[will often use it to find things that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m29s)

[haven't covered but if you see the red](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m32s)

[green you got to take it with a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m34s)

[bit of grain of salt because it's not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m36s)

[it's it's not real code coverage so but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m39s)

[it's it's it's good enough to give you a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m42s)

[pretty good idea and oftentimes I don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m43s)

[with just seeing the Red X or the green](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m46s)

[check and what line it occurs on is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m48s)

[often good enough for me to realize oh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m51s)

[yep I made this mistake in my test it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m53s)

[wonderful if you um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m55s)

[if you don't have somebody who's willing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h26m58s)

[to spring for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m00s)

[a visual studio license the other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m02s)

[popular one and this has existed for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m06s)

[years end crunch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m08s)

[is it it's basically the the the thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m10s)

[that Microsoft ripped off when they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m14s)

[built live unit testing was end crunch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m15s)

[end crunch has been around for a very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m18s)

[long time um and this is what they do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m20s)

[and they're real good at it so it also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m25s)

[has extra features beyond what live unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m27s)

[testing does and whatnot like end crunch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m30s)

[is is pretty slick it's really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m32s)

[slick so if you like the the live unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m34s)

[testing experience but can't get an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m38s)

[Enterprise license to visual studio uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m40s)

[and crunches often an alternative](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m43s)

[actually let me look I didn't what is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m45s)

[their pricing I'm not actually even sure](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m47s)

[about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m48s)

[that yeah named user it ain't cheap I'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m49s)

[put it that way it ain't cheap um but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m54s)

[it's really good and it's technically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h27m58s)

[cheaper than an Enterprise license of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m00s)

[Visual Studio obviously depending on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m01s)

[who's footing the bill](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m03s)

[where okay so but we could go through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m06s)

[and build out people will call these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m08s)

[things test doubles uh is I think the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m10s)

[most universal name that I've seen](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m13s)

[people will sometimes throw in the word](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m15s)

[substitute um I've seen people also call](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m17s)

[these things mocks as well I don't like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m20s)

[that because I think that muddies the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m23s)

[water like sure like technically you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m24s)

[correct but it's like I feel like that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m29s)

[term gets overloaded then and then it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m32s)

[gets real confusing so I oftentimes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m33s)

[we'll call these a test double um and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m35s)

[build those out that way um so this is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m39s)

[thing we could do the problem is writing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m42s)

[this is a lot of code writing this is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m43s)

[lot less code we like that this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m46s)

[functionally what the mock Library gives](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m49s)

[you is it gives you a mock class that is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m51s)

[generic and whatever you put as the T](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m55s)

[what it's going to do is it's going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h28m58s)

[generate something kind of like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m00s)

[imagine taking whatever you put as the T](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m03s)

[and making that the base of some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m05s)

[generated object where this thing then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m08s)

[says okay I'm going to override](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m10s)

[everything on the T and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m12s)

[give you things where you can do like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m14s)

[setups and control the returns and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m15s)

[validate how many times it was called so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m18s)

[it basically builds up all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m21s)

[like you could imagine this thing was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m23s)

[validated in the number of times this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m24s)

[was invoked imagine this thing has a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m26s)

[public int uh get data uh async dang NAB](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m28s)

[you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m34s)

[co-pilot show off okay cop now use the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m35s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m39s)

[ah uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m41s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m43s)

[equal one and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m45s)

[then uh let's see oh I'd have to I got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m49s)

[to extract this guy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m52s)

[out uh let's see here our](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m54s)

[service right so we're we're we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h29m58s)

[basically reimplementing everything that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m00s)

[mock gives us by](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m02s)

[hand uh service right so now we now we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m05s)

[can guarantee that one the method was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m08s)

[invoked it was invoked exactly one time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m10s)

[and that is basically identical to what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m12s)

[mock gives us here uh can you set up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m14s)

[multiple times to override multiple](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m17s)

[method returns or do you have to change](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m19s)

[something ah great question great great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m20s)

[question we are going to dive into that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m22s)

[in just a second um but you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m24s)

[you can start to see that the idea with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m28s)

[mock is to make having to write all of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m30s)

[these by hand a lot less painful and a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m33s)

[little bit more autogen magicky right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m36s)

[it's not Source generated it uses a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m39s)

[library in the hood called Castle](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m41s)

[Dynamic proxy think of this as uh Coen](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m43s)

[at runtime so Castle Dynamic proxy has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m47s)

[been around for years it's stable it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m50s)

[awesome a lot of mocking libraries use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m52s)

[it under the hood its API is just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m54s)

[miserable to work with and that's where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m57s)

[every mocking Library comes in and goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h30m59s)

[I know I can make a pretty face to put](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m01s)

[on top of this that's it right okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m03s)

[uh setup sequence I think oh Victor you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m07s)

[are on point uh yes yes uh and anything](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m09s)

[uses it yeah exactly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m15s)

[um so let's take a look so when you go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m18s)

[through and create a mock the easiest](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m21s)

[way to create a mock is just straight up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m23s)

[to invoke its Constructor but let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m24s)

[start at the API here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m26s)

[there are a couple things you could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m27s)

[imagine because if we uh uh imagine our](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m29s)

[mock down here by doing nothing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m34s)

[something using this service is always](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m37s)

[just going to get this task from result](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m39s)

[right but when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m41s)

[uh when mock is generating the override](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m44s)

[because it's going to gen this its](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m48s)

[version of this testing web service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m50s)

[class all by itself for methods that are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m51s)

[not void returning it has to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m54s)

[something when you call it right you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m56s)

[just can't have a non-void returning](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h31m58s)

[method not return something so the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m00s)

[default behavior of mock is okay if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m04s)

[don't tell me anything about the method](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m07s)

[what I'm going to do is I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m09s)

[return a default value and I'm I'm doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m11s)

[the air quotes there because it is not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m15s)

[it is not doing you know return default](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m19s)

[task of string right this would be bad](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m22s)

[right right the the the compiler's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m26s)

[already yelling at me going hey are you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m29s)

[sure you meant to do this is probably](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m31s)

[not what you meant it's like right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m33s)

[because the default of task of string is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m35s)

[null and if you return null from a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m38s)

[method like this it's gonna](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m41s)

[throw and that's probably not what you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m44s)

[were going for right like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m47s)

[that's that if you end up awaiting on a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m50s)

[null return that's that's not right so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m53s)

[it's a little smarter when I say returns](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h32m58s)

[default and in this case it's going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m00s)

[go okay hang on this is an asynchronous](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m01s)

[method it's a task of string got it what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m04s)

[we're going to do is we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m07s)

[return you know task from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m09s)

[result of string and we'll return the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m13s)

[default of string we're going to be a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m16s)

[little bit smarter](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m19s)

[um oh Castle winds are Izzy you are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m22s)

[you're dating yourself a little bit but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m24s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m26s)

[um so when it's returning figuring out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m28s)

[what the default Behavior ises it goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m31s)

[okay I'm I'm going to be a little bit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m32s)

[smarter I'm not just going to blindly do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m34s)

[this so if the if it's one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m37s)

[well-known things like task or value](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m39s)

[task or whatnot I'll return a value it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m41s)

[just the value inside of that task is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m44s)

[going to be the default of strength](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m47s)

[which is no right this is one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m48s)

[areas that bites really hard with Noble](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m51s)

[reference types because I have Noble](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m53s)

[reference types turned on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m56s)

[right this is not this is not nullable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h33m57s)

[string but if I do nothing with my with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m00s)

[my mock I am going to get back a null](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m05s)

[right that is not going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m09s)

[work this is going to end up saying](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m12s)

[well so and and more explicitly if I get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m15s)

[rid of this setup right where I've where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m18s)

[I've control it ah I can type I can type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m20s)

[if I get rid of this set](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m25s)

[up the the return here is going to be a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m27s)

[null on a method that is explicitly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m31s)

[declared nonn knowable this is not great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m34s)

[right this is one of the drawbacks and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m37s)

[there's no good way around](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m40s)

[this is one of the options that's worth](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m42s)

[knowing about is on on your mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m45s)

[Constructor there is a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m48s)

[behavior um enum and the de you'll knowe](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m50s)

[there's there's default loose and strict](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m54s)

[okay these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m57s)

[guys and the the default mock Behavior](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h34m59s)

[Uh hang on we do this we go and look at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m03s)

[it there's secretly even though there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m07s)

[three enu members there's really only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m08s)

[two right strict loose and default which](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m11s)

[is also loose and I I personally abhor](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m16s)

[the fact that the en's declared this way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m20s)

[because yeah it feels weird that the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m23s)

[default en member is not the zeroi](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m26s)

[member and and that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m28s)

[yeah mock behavior. default is not the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m30s)

[same as default mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m32s)

[behavior and that makes me Twitch a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m35s)

[little bit I don't like that I don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m38s)

[like that at all um and if you don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m40s)

[specify anything to your Constructor you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m43s)

[are going to get the behavior of default](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m45s)

[which is loose now for anyone you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m46s)

[catch it right away the difference](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m49s)

[between these two a loose mock says go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m50s)

[ahead and do that default return type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m54s)

[Behavior](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m56s)

[right and that's what most people are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m57s)

[familiar with with mock is getting that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h35m59s)

[kind of default return if I didn't do a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m01s)

[setup the alternative is you can say no](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m02s)

[no no I'm going to do a strict Mock and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m05s)

[that means if anything gets inv vote and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m08s)

[I didn't and I didn't do a setup on it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m11s)

[just throw straight throw I don't like I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m14s)

[want your default implementation of all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m16s)

[of these methods to be just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m18s)

[throw](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m21s)

[um oh Mr X thank you uh I don't know if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m23s)

[you caught at the beginning automach is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m27s)

[also one that I'm a maintainer on so I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m29s)

[a little biased so little biased heavily](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m31s)

[biased um so but worth noting that you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m34s)

[do have the option of a strict mock as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m37s)

[as a choice this can be quite helpful](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m40s)

[especially because it is very hard in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m43s)

[unit test to assert a negative right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m45s)

[there is not a great way to say I want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m48s)

[to write a test to assert that something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m50s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m52s)

[happen right it's it's not always](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m54s)

[trivial to do that the closest thing we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h36m57s)

[can get is usually a strict mock or a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m00s)

[setup that always throws or similar and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m03s)

[say okay that's probably good enough](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m05s)

[that's probably the closest we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m09s)

[to get um you can also do on the verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m10s)

[you can do like a ver uh verify times uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m14s)

[what is it none never there one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m19s)

[one of the nword](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m22s)

[um this this is the closest thing we can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m24s)

[usually get to verify negative but it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m26s)

[not often times when people want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m29s)

[verify negative things they're usually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m31s)

[things that aren't easy to test for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m34s)

[right I want to verify that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m36s)

[you know use a config](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m39s)

[value really how do you verify that some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m41s)

[code doesn't use a config value the best](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m44s)

[you can do is if you can control the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m47s)

[access to the config say well on access](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m49s)

[throw it my my test didn't crash so it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m52s)

[probably didn't throw like those are the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m56s)

[types of things that start to get really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h37m58s)

[awkward right and I'm goingon to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m01s)

[put I want to put this guy back here so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m03s)

[worth knowing worth knowing about that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m06s)

[on the Constructor the last overload on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m08s)

[the Constructor that that uh people need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m10s)

[to be highly aware of um well I guess](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m13s)

[we'll do two is the where is the the use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m16s)

[private oh it's not on here oh that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m20s)

[right I'm getting confused uh the uh um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m22s)

[the arguments we'll go there is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m27s)

[sometimes you need to pass arguments to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m30s)

[a Constructor now in this case we are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m32s)

[mocking an interface interfaces](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m35s)

[currently in C have no Constructor I I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m38s)

[don't worry I don't think there's any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m42s)

[plans to give them to give them](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m43s)

[Constructors hopefully any see Sharp](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m45s)

[team people are listening please do not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m48s)

[do that thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m50s)

[um uh let's see this guy is failing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m52s)

[because it is in fact called once and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m55s)

[there we go green perfect um but it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h38m58s)

[very possible we may realize you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m02s)

[what there are occasionally times where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m05s)

[putting something behind an interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m08s)

[doesn't make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m10s)

[sense I often times uh will uh in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m12s)

[interviews I like to quiz people on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m16s)

[interfaces because I think they are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m18s)

[deceptively](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m21s)

[difficult look most developers can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m22s)

[usually like if I ask about an interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m26s)

[they will give me the Academia level](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m28s)

[answer right an interface establishes a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m31s)

[contract in net sometimes people use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m33s)

[them um to to get kind of multiple](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m36s)

[inheritance type Behavior if they get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m39s)

[really fancy they start talking about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m41s)

[like default interface implementations](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m43s)

[that kind of thing that's great right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m45s)

[and usually that's the that's the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m48s)

[minimum answer I'm willing to accept](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m49s)

[from somebody on on interfaces right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m51s)

[give me the Academia based answer for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m52s)

[interfaces the problem is is the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m54s)

[Academia based answer misses the mark](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h39m57s)

[completely on the point of when and why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m00s)

[to use an interface right I you can ask](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m03s)

[the question of hey when should you use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m06s)

[an interface or why should you use an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m08s)

[interface and often time I love watching](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m10s)

[people squirm on this question it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m12s)

[great hopefully nobody who I interview](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m14s)

[in the future is is watching the stream](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m16s)

[because I'm about to hand you gold um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m18s)

[the the when and the why to use an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m21s)

[interface uh again often times you get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m24s)

[the Academia based answer of well you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m27s)

[want to hide away the actual](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m29s)

[implementation details and you get you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m31s)

[know some answer about like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m33s)

[encapsulation or you know you want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m34s)

[give yourself an injection point for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m37s)

[mocking that's another thing that people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m39s)

[say if your reason for using an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m41s)

[interface is an injection point for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m43s)

[mocking I will argue you've missed the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m44s)

[Mark um it's not quite there because the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m48s)

[problem with interfaces is often times](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m52s)

[people do not spend spend they they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m55s)

[spend a whole bunch of time right here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h40m57s)

[focused on what to do with the interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m00s)

[and not a lot of time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m02s)

[here right this is where interfaces I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m05s)

[think get really hard is figuring out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m08s)

[what is the structure uh that needs to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m10s)

[be here I love it absolutely love it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m13s)

[when I hear people in interviews start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m15s)

[talking about like the interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m18s)

[segregation principle right because a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m19s)

[couple things that people get wrong on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m22s)

[interfaces a lot is they go well I need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m23s)

[a new method for for my web service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m26s)

[let's just tack that in right and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m28s)

[co-pilot's being a great example two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m30s)

[methods one's get data async ones get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m33s)

[Json async this is horrible absolutely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m35s)

[horrible](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m37s)

[right what do each of these methods do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m40s)

[why do they do that like how they're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m43s)

[named and the signature of them I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m45s)

[is hard to do well and when more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m47s)

[importantly when should this be oh get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m49s)

[XML oh co-pilot you're just going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m53s)

[self-destruct I can see it now I love it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m55s)

[um should these be separate interfaces](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h41m57s)

[right and being able to separate what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m01s)

[bit of functionality should go in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m03s)

[interface a what bit of functionality](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m05s)

[should go in interface B because my web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m07s)

[service like we could have a public](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m09s)

[interface I Json web service right um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m13s)

[that maybe has some some bit of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m20s)

[different logic and we start separating](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m23s)

[these things up and there's nothing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m25s)

[stopping me from doing this right and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m26s)

[saying okay here's what we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m30s)

[do uh Implement interface right um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m31s)

[Implement interface right so I could I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m36s)

[could do it this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m38s)

[way but I could also do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m40s)

[it this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m44s)

[way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m46s)

[right and things and this this is where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m48s)

[I don't see people spending a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m51s)

[time they just do whichever thing works](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m52s)

[and functionally you'll knowe nothing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m55s)

[changes about my web service in this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h42m56s)

[this and where I put this interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m28s)

[whether it's a base of I web service or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m31s)

[similar changes a little bit whether I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m33s)

[might take in one parameter two but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m36s)

[your di setup may be a little different](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m47s)

[but this is where where things start to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m50s)

[get really interesting and often times I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m52s)

[feel like people do do not focus enough](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m55s)

[time here and spend all of their time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h43m57s)

[and not designing the interface well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m02s)

[they are really hard to get right and do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m03s)

[when and why of interfaces I would love](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m21s)

[to hear something about the interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m23s)

[signature and API of an interface and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m30s)

[designing it bonus points if you use the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m33s)

[phrase leaky](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m35s)

[abstraction um that's often times when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m37s)

[for example you'll note the return type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m40s)

[here is string but get XML](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m43s)

[async right there's there's a question](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m45s)

[about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m48s)

[when um when the implementation starts](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m50s)

[to leak up into your interface whether](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m53s)

[that that be with a type or sometimes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m55s)

[even just based upon the name that can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h44m58s)

[be bad and it's not limited to Here For](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m00s)

[example this is I web service and this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m02s)

[is I Json web service if my method's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m05s)

[really going to be you know get Json and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m08s)

[that's kind of vague but maybe it's like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m10s)

[get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m12s)

[config is web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m13s)

[relevant](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m16s)

[right is it important that it comes from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m17s)

[web or is it just important that it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m20s)

[provides](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m22s)

[Json things like that that little little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m23s)

[naming things they start to make the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m26s)

[life both interesting and complicated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m27s)

[and I love it love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m29s)

[love it love it so interfaces](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m32s)

[deceptively difficult yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m35s)

[yada](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m37s)

[yada uh okay I'm going to go and whack](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m38s)

[that off the Constructor because that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m40s)

[just going to make my life a little more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m42s)

[challenging but the the other thing I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m43s)

[wanted to point out is what if we don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m45s)

[want to use an interface and maybe we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m48s)

[don't have an interface for example n](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m51s)

[framework is a great example here is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m53s)

[it's quite common if you have uh and I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m56s)

[just going to I'm going to fake NTI](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h45m59s)

[framework here real quick uh how about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m02s)

[my DB context right so pretend like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m05s)

[is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m08s)

[a pretend this is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m10s)

[real uh EF](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m14s)

[context right so you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m17s)

[know all the usual stuff you see in here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m20s)

[right your DB sets maybe some opt the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m23s)

[model creating etc etc](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m26s)

[etc it's quite common to say well you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m28s)

[know what this class is going to take in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m31s)

[an instance of my DB](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m33s)

[context right and perhaps and and again](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m37s)

[I'm I'm picking on EF here and this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m40s)

[potentially not the right place to do it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m42s)

[but there are times where it doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m44s)

[make sense to use an interface and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m46s)

[instead you should have a concrete class](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m48s)

[right and so we're going to do you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m51s)

[public uh void save changes again I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m54s)

[I'm making this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m58s)

[look](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h46m59s)

[realish right and so let's imagine here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m01s)

[that we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m04s)

[also create an assigned field contacts](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m06s)

[great sounds good add n check let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m09s)

[imagine that as part of our get data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m11s)

[async after we've gotten the data you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m13s)

[know do stuff with data and then we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m15s)

[going to do context save](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m19s)

[changes right and actually we can we can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m22s)

[go even crazier Doon changes a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m24s)

[sync oh are you going to be smart and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m30s)

[know that I did do the return type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m32s)

[correctly probably not no you're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m34s)

[that smart](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m36s)

[Okay uh return task completed task right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m38s)

[okay so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m43s)

[there so the the thing here is we may](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m45s)

[want to validate uh let's see this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m48s)

[validating retrieves data and I'm going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m51s)

[to once again just go mock of and this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m53s)

[is this is another thing that I I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m56s)

[people often don't realize that they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m57s)

[have uh at their disposable is mock of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h47m59s)

[of I just need a mock of this type I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m03s)

[don't care about doing setups I just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m06s)

[need to shove something in because you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m09s)

[know what for this particular test I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m11s)

[focused on retrieving data I am not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m13s)

[focused on doing anything else right so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m16s)

[we're gonna we're going to grab this guy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m21s)

[real quick bring it down here keep going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m22s)

[right uh on command executes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m25s)

[uh uh persist data now I'm doing these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m29s)

[as two separate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m33s)

[tests uh quite often when writing these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m35s)

[tests there's a a general consensus that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m39s)

[you should one ideally if your methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m43s)

[are only doing one thing and they're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m46s)

[doing too much work this gets easy it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m47s)

[gets hard if your methods are doing too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m49s)

[much work is your test should test one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m50s)

[thing at a time and again I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m54s)

[putting air quotes around one thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m57s)

[because I usually tell people one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h48m59s)

[logical thing what is the logical thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m01s)

[here right if you've got a command](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m04s)

[that's like retrieve data well add in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m06s)

[one more assert to make sure that you've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m09s)

[appropriately save the data is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m11s)

[potentially perfectly fine inside of a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m13s)

[test um but test should generally focus](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m15s)

[on asserting on one condition and this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m19s)

[is often times where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m24s)

[I will focus in on the name of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m26s)

[somebody's test because if you've named](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m28s)

[your test well the name of your test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m30s)

[drives without one condition is that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m32s)

[you're testing and therefore uh your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m34s)

[content should follow so if you find](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m38s)

[yourself starting to use the words and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m40s)

[and or in your test name that's usually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m42s)

[an indication you should probably knock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m45s)

[it off and not do that so we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m48s)

[actually take the drive this point home](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m51s)

[we're going to go mock of on this side](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m53s)

[and get an ieb service and again this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m57s)

[going to end up giving me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h49m59s)

[a uh actually yeah you know what in this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m01s)

[case I don't want to control](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m05s)

[that yep we're not going to cert on any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m08s)

[of this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m10s)

[stuff right and so here we are going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m12s)

[go mock of uh my DB](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m14s)

[context uh context](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m18s)

[Mock and then we will come over here and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m22s)

[do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m25s)

[do context mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m26s)

[doob right and this is something that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m29s)

[think people often times Miss is you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m31s)

[mock a concrete type oh look at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m35s)

[that thank you co-pilot you're very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m38s)

[helpful today uh I don't see my live](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m41s)

[unit testing so I'm going to compile](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m43s)

[usually if I don't see my live unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m45s)

[testing running it's because I have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m46s)

[oh mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m50s)

[of my DB content](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m53s)

[unit testing running it's because it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m58s)

[failed to compile okay perfect so we can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h50m59s)

[see this test has failed right and we'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m03s)

[we'll actually go and look at our test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m06s)

[window to see expand all please I don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m07s)

[want to think too hard so we can see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m10s)

[here this guy is now throwing an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m12s)

[used in setup or verification](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m30s)

[expressions and this is something that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m33s)

[very important to note with mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m35s)

[whenever you're doing a Lambda whether](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m38s)

[that's a setup or a verify if you look](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m40s)

[at the signature here let's see if I can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m42s)

[grab it oh I did you'll note the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m44s)

[parameter type is of type expression](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m46s)

[it's not of type Funk or delegate that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m50s)

[means this Lambda is um evaluated not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m53s)

[executed right so if I put my cursor](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h51m59s)

[test what you will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m04s)

[see well that didn't help it moved my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m08s)

[breakpoint outside of it dang it I was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m11s)

[hoping to I was hoping to make a point](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m13s)

[the debugger is too smart for me um is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m14s)

[it will not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m17s)

[actually execute this code inside of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m19s)

[here at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m21s)

[all that is not a thing that is going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m22s)

[to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m25s)

[occur](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m26s)

[so that is important because when mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m28s)

[takes in this expression it has to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m31s)

[figure out how it's going to generate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m34s)

[its class right and in this case mock is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m36s)

[trying to generate a derive class for my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m39s)

[DB context but my DB context only have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m42s)

[save changes async now the the quick and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m45s)

[dirty approach here is you just make it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m48s)

[virtual right because once it's virtual](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m51s)

[you can imagine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m54s)

[uh in your test project you could make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m55s)

[your you know testable my DB context and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h52m58s)

[now you can override save changes and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m00s)

[you can do like an increment or count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m03s)

[and this that and the other and you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m04s)

[Off to the Races and you see now we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m06s)

[running you'll note these little circles](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m08s)

[here are not tied to live unit testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m10s)

[they're tied to the regular test Runner](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m12s)

[so you can see that they are completely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m14s)

[out of sync but our test is now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m16s)

[passing and we can see that that is uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m19s)

[now properly working and you'll know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m23s)

[when we look at this guy live unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m25s)

[testing these little blue lines on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m27s)

[side here these indicate that a line was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m30s)

[not executed during any unit test so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m33s)

[when I am looking for things to see if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m38s)

[I've actually covered my code properly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m41s)

[with live unit testing turned on I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m44s)

[looking for blue lines because I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m45s)

[looking for if it wasn't executed as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m47s)

[part of the test run I guarantee it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m49s)

[not tested if it was executed I can't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m51s)

[guarantee it's tested but I can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m55s)

[guarantee it was run those are not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m57s)

[always the same thing right people often](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h53m59s)

[use code coverage to indicate whether](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m01s)

[something's tested or not no you can't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m02s)

[do that code coverage indicates whether](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m05s)

[it was executed not whether it's tested](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m07s)

[the is it tested requires actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m09s)

[looking at the test to see you know does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m11s)

[the test actually assert on something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m14s)

[valid or not so don't get those two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m16s)

[things confused uh and this guy should](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m19s)

[probably be awaiting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m21s)

[it boom something like that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m22s)

[so you can see this guy here never](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m28s)

[actually gets invoked which is fine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m30s)

[right that's sort of what we expect we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m33s)

[sort of anticipated that when we did](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m36s)

[this mock that by default it's going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m39s)

[go ahead and override the me the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m42s)

[virtual members which in this case is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m45s)

[the safe changes async and it's going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m47s)

[give us that option but be aware if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m49s)

[run into this air which I just had um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m51s)

[somebody messaged me about earlier today](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m55s)

[they were trying to use a mock of a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m57s)

[strongly typed object and didn't quite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h54m58s)

[understand how to to deal with the fact](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m02s)

[that it uh was giving that uh expression](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m04s)

[air hey dead brrum welcome welcome](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m09s)

[welcome welcome we are having fun](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m12s)

[testing uh have you ever done mutation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m15s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m17s)

[only never on a uh production](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m19s)

[application I've played around with it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m23s)

[um in kind of some handful of projects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m26s)

[it's pretty cool uh especially for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m29s)

[people who are interested in really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m32s)

[trying to kind of sus out bugs mutation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m35s)

[testing is pretty cool uh I will say](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m38s)

[most projects I get called in to help on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m42s)

[the teams struggle just to have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m44s)

[reasonable unit tests and I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m46s)

[mutation testing is this mutation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m49s)

[testing is targeted at people who have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m51s)

[unit tests and are wanting to make a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m55s)

[little bit more certain that their code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h55m58s)

[is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m00s)

[bulletproof uh and it works really well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m01s)

[for that or or at least as I've seen I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m03s)

[just I feel like that's like it's step](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m06s)

[two or step three and a lot of t uh a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m08s)

[lot of uh people are still on step one a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m11s)

[lot of people are still on step one um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m15s)

[oftentimes when I come in one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m18s)

[things that I I I focus on is just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m20s)

[getting people to write better tests uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m22s)

[yeah we struggle to get to Step One](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m25s)

[don't feel](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m26s)

[bad I think that's where where a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m27s)

[people are at is often times nobody](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m30s)

[focuses on how to write tests or how to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m34s)

[write better tests and so people either](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m36s)

[have very few tests or they have a very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m40s)

[poor tests both are bad right um some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m44s)

[people get Twitchy because I will often](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m48s)

[come in and just start deleting unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m49s)

[tests and people don't like that because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m51s)

[they're like why and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m53s)

[it's like if your test isn't providing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m55s)

[value delete](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m57s)

[it it sounds extreme but seriously it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h56m59s)

[costing you execution time and developer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m03s)

[Cycles on your pipeline at a minimum for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m05s)

[a like a worth a test that's not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m08s)

[providing value shouldn't live it should](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m10s)

[be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m13s)

[deleted uh did it once C project found](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m14s)

[that 50% of the code was Point lless](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m17s)

[yeah yeah and those types of things are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m19s)

[amazing because right now I think most](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m22s)

[of the time when people are are doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m24s)

[these types of testing um I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m26s)

[analyzers are the closest a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m29s)

[people get or if they're running like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m30s)

[some of the jet brains tools like Ryder](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m31s)

[resharper they're a little bit better at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m33s)

[detecting like dead code or missed](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m35s)

[things because the the C analyzers the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m37s)

[moment you declare something public it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m40s)

[goes well you might use this in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m41s)

[library somewhere it may be invoked by](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m44s)

[some system I'm not aware of I'm going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m47s)

[to assume it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m49s)

[used whereas the jet brains products you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m50s)

[they they I'm trying to remember what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m53s)

[what they call it there's a setting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m54s)

[where you it's like pessimistic versus](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m55s)

[optimistic and you can tell it hey this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h57m57s)

[is an app I'm never referencing it as a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m00s)

[library don't make that assumption show](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m02s)

[me my dead stuff right and then you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m04s)

[you can start walking the thing and and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m06s)

[tree pruning](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m08s)

[um yeah 60% test coverage super brittle](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m12s)

[and half broken yes dead breadcrumb](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m15s)

[don't feel bad I think a lot of projects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m17s)

[are right about at that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m20s)

[point okay but we've got this back we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m23s)

[we've got this thing here now I want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m26s)

[Circle back to the thing that Benjamin](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m28s)

[asked a little bit earlier about if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m30s)

[wanted to if you had something that was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m32s)

[potentially doing multiple calls like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m35s)

[let's say let's say we're doing this um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m37s)

[data one data two data one it's data two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m41s)

[right we want to do something of this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m45s)

[nature this is now see look at that test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m49s)

[fails M love it love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m54s)

[cuz right now our test is failing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m56s)

[because we are expecting that our data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h58m58s)

[property is just going to be my result](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m02s)

[and let's imagine we want it to be uh my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m05s)

[result and then I don't know space hello](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m09s)

[world because that is that is useful](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m14s)

[right so we're going to do this we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m18s)

[going to do this and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m20s)

[come down here and we're going to say](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m22s)

[expected data one plus expected data 2](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m23s)

[boom that's what we expect to get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m26s)

[obviously this is failing if we look at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m29s)

[the I close it again I need to stop](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m32s)

[closing it live unit testing window boom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m34s)

[we look at our thing we can see that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m36s)

[right now it's just concatenating my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m38s)

[result with my result kind of makes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m40s)

[sense we we invoke the method twice and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m42s)

[each time it was told return my result](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m47s)

[and it dutifully returned the same thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m49s)

[every time but imagine you actually want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m51s)

[to do something a little more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m54s)

[interesting so Victor hit it right on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m55s)

[the head uh setup sequence is the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=00h59m57s)

[magical incantation um uh yeah I'm also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m01s)

[go back to that so you'll note here we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m06s)

[can do return async and we haven't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m08s)

[changed much between setup and setup a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m11s)

[sync unless you look really closely at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m13s)

[the return types between these two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m16s)

[you'll note setup sequence returns an I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m18s)

[setup sequence result or I setup](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m21s)

[sequential result right um whereas if we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m24s)

[just do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m28s)

[setup it returns an oh missed it I gota](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m30s)

[I okay Visual Studio I would love it if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m34s)

[there was a method to not gray out those](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m37s)

[things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m41s)

[um some point I'm going to poke around](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m43s)

[and find](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m45s)

[it and the the difference here you'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m46s)

[note when I do a a return async even](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m49s)

[though these methods are named the same](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m51s)

[they're returning very different types](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m53s)

[and so your ability to chain them even](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m55s)

[though the code you write looks similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h00m57s)

[these are separate methods they they're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m00s)

[named similarly to make this type of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m02s)

[thing um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m05s)

[easy but they they are very different](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m08s)

[methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m11s)

[altogether okay and you can see now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m12s)

[we've gotten past our assert equals so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m14s)

[our data property is now properly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m17s)

[expected data 1 expected data 2 and now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m20s)

[where we're failing is on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m23s)

[verification of our uh uh service is we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m25s)

[had we had told that hey we only expect](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m29s)

[get data async to be invoked once well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m31s)

[now that expectation has changed right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m34s)

[so we can come in here and we can say](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m36s)

[okay we want it to be you know at least](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m37s)

[once at most once between some number of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m40s)

[calls honestly these top ones I don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m44s)

[use that much usually if I'm doing this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m47s)

[type of setup it's uh once never uh or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m49s)

[exactly like these are these are your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m54s)

[three big ones most of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m56s)

[time like 99.9% of the time I know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h01m58s)

[exactly how many times I expect a method](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m03s)

[to be called based upon my setup or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m05s)

[similar there's not like outside stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m08s)

[that I that I'm worried about I know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m11s)

[exactly what it's supposed to be but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m15s)

[that does lead into a good point there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m17s)

[are times it is better to not use a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m19s)

[mock is often time if you can get away](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m23s)

[with it do not use a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m26s)

[mock okay I'll say that again if you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m29s)

[get away with it do not use a mock use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m32s)

[the real use the real thing right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m34s)

[sometimes I see people putting in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m37s)

[interfaces because they want to test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m39s)

[things in isolation but this some of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m40s)

[stuff that they mock end up being things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m43s)

[that they're they're methods that don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m45s)

[necessarily have adverse side effects or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m47s)

[that it's kind of the logic that you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m50s)

[want to um to test so the problem with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m51s)

[mocks and interfaces in general is there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m55s)

[seams in your code right they're they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h02m57s)

[places where where the joints fit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m00s)

[together you imagine um I'll call myself](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m02s)

[an amateur plumber right if you've got a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m05s)

[a pipe with a bunch of fittings putting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m07s)

[together where is the pipe going to leak](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m10s)

[right at the fitting right right where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m12s)

[the two things come together and in code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m14s)

[people put interfaces all over and it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m16s)

[like having a bunch of small sections of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m18s)

[pipe with a ton of little fittings all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m20s)

[over the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m22s)

[place and even people who have great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m23s)

[test coverage every place where there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m26s)

[one of those fittings that's where the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m28s)

[bugs come in because this test is only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m30s)

[as good as me making this mock behave](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m34s)

[like the real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m37s)

[service the moment this mock doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m38s)

[behave like the real service all bets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m40s)

[are off and this test may be worthless](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m42s)

[because it's very easy with mocks to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m46s)

[test conditions that are not reachable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m49s)

[otherwise right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m52s)

[it is possible with mock to test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m54s)

[conditions that are not reachable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m56s)

[otherwise because the real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h03m59s)

[implementation would prevent it and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m00s)

[because you're testing an implementation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m02s)

[that doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m04s)

[exist Does that actually matter right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m05s)

[now some people might go well somebody](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m07s)

[might create a second implementation of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m09s)

[the interface and register that in Di](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m11s)

[and so I'm testing behavior that might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m13s)

[exist right sure fine maybe but you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m15s)

[putting a bunch of seams in and the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m19s)

[point of these tests is to guarant or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m21s)

[guarantee to build confidence that your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m23s)

[code is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m25s)

[correct the point of these tests is to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m27s)

[build confidence that your code is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m29s)

[correct uh an interface describes the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m30s)

[edge of a jigsaw piece yeah like how](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m33s)

[things fit together but it is much](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m36s)

[easier to put together a two-piece](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m40s)

[puzzle than a 10piece](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m42s)

[puzzle right I can guarantee if I've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m45s)

[only got two pieces of the puzzle there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m47s)

[it's going to be much easier to make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m50s)

[everything line up and go together](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m51s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m53s)

[I like the puzzle example I may have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m55s)

[steal that Izzy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m57s)

[um so if possible use the use a real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h04m59s)

[implementation like I see people do this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m05s)

[with like um like hashing and encryption](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m07s)

[code is they they wrap it up and put it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m11s)

[somewhere else behind an interface so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m12s)

[they can test it and then they have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m14s)

[mock away that interface and you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m17s)

[they've got like a base 64 function that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m19s)

[they've hidden behind an interface and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m21s)

[they're they're test method returns a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m23s)

[string that's not base 64 encoded it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m25s)

[like well yeah and then you know their](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m27s)

[code works and then at runtime there's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m30s)

[bug it's like well yeah you weren't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m31s)

[returning real data because now you've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m33s)

[got a disjoint between those two things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m35s)

[don't do that don't do that use the real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m36s)

[thing there's there was no issue using](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m38s)

[the real thing just you when possible](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m40s)

[use it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m43s)

[uh let's see what if web Ser the web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m46s)

[service you want to want the return of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m49s)

[the output of multiple methods uh get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m51s)

[data get XML Etc yeah so if it was if it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m53s)

[was actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m57s)

[concatenating multiple different methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h05m58s)

[this would just end up being multiple](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m00s)

[setups](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m02s)

[right so setup get data async right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m04s)

[uh I'm tempted to leave this for the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m11s)

[moment let's make a second method real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m15s)

[quick um I'm just going to go uh public](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m18s)

[uh async task get data to async don't do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m23s)

[this this is bad](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m29s)

[implementation right but we're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m30s)

[we're going to do it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m32s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m35s)

[wow I mean that's not bad but uh no uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m37s)

[get XML async all right so something to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m41s)

[that effect and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m43s)

[here because this gets me most of what I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m45s)

[want and go here uh get data](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m47s)

[2 and we're no longer going through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m52s)

[through the command so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m54s)

[that and we're going to go get data to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m55s)

[async yeah in case you didn't catch it I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h06m58s)

[subtly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m01s)

[switched oh and I'm I'm doing this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m02s)

[bad well we'll come back to that in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m06s)

[minute I just noticed that I wasn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m08s)

[doing an async test so I should I should](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m09s)

[do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m12s)

[that um but what this ends up being is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m13s)

[this ends up just being uh setup get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m15s)

[data and then this ends up being second](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m19s)

[set up here here uh get XML async and it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m23s)

[goes like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m28s)

[this and I think that goes here this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m29s)

[then ends up being times](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m32s)

[one and this becomes get xmla async](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m33s)

[times exactly one something something of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m38s)

[that nature now I have done a ridiculous](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m40s)

[amount of assertions](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m44s)

[here there is a concept of not asserting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m45s)

[on things often times because people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m50s)

[will write their tests quite commonly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m53s)

[after they've written their](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m56s)

[code right um where I work we don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h07m58s)

[necessarily care whether people do test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m01s)

[driven development or not um but at poll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m03s)

[request time we expect to see tested](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m06s)

[code the the idea with test driven](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m09s)

[development and one of its benefits is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m12s)

[it forces you to almost think about your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m14s)

[assertions before writing the code and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m15s)

[if you write the code first often times](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m18s)

[people's assertions basically come down](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m20s)

[to hey I looked at this method well I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m23s)

[can see what it's doing therefore I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m25s)

[assert on what it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m27s)

[doing um some people will refer to this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m28s)

[as like a pinning unit test it's pinning](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m30s)

[the functionality to exactly that um a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m32s)

[much better approach is to think about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m35s)

[what am I testing and why and saying](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m37s)

[okay what like I want to test get two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m41s)

[data async what is important about this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m44s)

[method is it important that it calls](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m46s)

[context save changes is that important](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m49s)

[or is that an implementation detail](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m51s)

[right is that important or is that an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m55s)

[implementation detail because ideally](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h08m56s)

[you want to assert that it behaves the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m00s)

[way you want not that it invokes the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m03s)

[methods you expect now those things are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m06s)

[often similar but not always the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m09s)

[same right so and and this is where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m12s)

[naming of it really St really goes a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m15s)

[long way of thinking about what is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m18s)

[important for me to actually test here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m20s)

[is it important that it does this if the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m22s)

[and often times the easiest thing is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m27s)

[would I want this test to fail if this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m29s)

[were](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m31s)

[gone right Andrew people write code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m33s)

[first to make Code Pilot write unit test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m37s)

[for them uh guilty is charged yes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m38s)

[absolutely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m41s)

[100% um also I need to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m43s)

[uh recant something I think I said on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m47s)

[stream a while back I don't know if it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m50s)

[going to show up I don't know if it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m51s)

[going to to show my history in here or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m53s)

[not I should be a little careful um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m54s)

[previously I had told people co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h09m57s)

[chat was the next best thing to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m00s)

[worthless um it has gotten significantly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m02s)

[better significantly better I I banged](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m06s)

[my head against the wall dealing with an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m10s)

[open API spec that I couldn't figure out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m12s)

[what was wrong with it spent an hour](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m14s)

[trying to track it down finally got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m17s)

[annoyed copied pasted it in co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m19s)

[chat and said what's wrong with this and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m21s)

[it spit out the answer exactly on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m23s)

[mark and I went dang nabbit dang](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m25s)

[nabbit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m30s)

[so I have reinstalled it and I'm giving](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m32s)

[it a I'm giving it a second chance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m36s)

[because it it it earned itself a second](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m39s)

[try on that one because I spent an hour](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m42s)

[not thinking about I'll just ask the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m44s)

[magical AI to tell me what's wrong with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m46s)

[my code and it got it immediately](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m48s)

[spotted the issue I'm like dang it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m51s)

[stupid automated rubber ducks um yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m54s)

[so uh see Victor on the subject of what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h10m58s)

[and why with mock could you touch on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m01s)

[being care that you're testing the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m03s)

[behavior of the unit rather than the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m05s)

[setup ah yes that is a very good call](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m08s)

[out um so often times and some people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m11s)

[will refer to this as mocking away the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m15s)

[assertions because it it is very easy to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m19s)

[accidentally walk yourself into a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m22s)

[situation where in this case we um uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m24s)

[let's see so this case we're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m30s)

[through set.](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m31s)

[dat](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m32s)

[um trying to think of what's what's a a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m35s)

[quick way to go through and do this uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m38s)

[but the idea being that you end up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m40s)

[asserting that your e that your setups](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m41s)

[are set up properly which doesn't make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m45s)

[sense right um another another way that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m48s)

[it that it comes in is sometimes people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m52s)

[will like to try to throw like an assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m54s)

[up here like I want to and and this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h11m57s)

[this is probably a good example up here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m00s)

[right is it is not uncommon for me to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m03s)

[see somebody do something like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m06s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m08s)

[equal right one uh or actually let's do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m10s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m15s)

[zero su. count right it is not uncommon](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m16s)

[for me to see somebody want to write a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m20s)

[test like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m22s)

[where they're like you know I'm testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m24s)

[the increment I want to make sure it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m25s)

[increments by one so I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m27s)

[through and I'm going to assert that my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m29s)

[count starts at zero invoke the command](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m31s)

[and then I want the count to be one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m34s)

[right and there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m37s)

[nothing inherently wrong about this per](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m39s)

[se like the it's it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m43s)

[goodish but this isn't quite like the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m47s)

[once you start seeing asserts outside of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m51s)

[the assert portion of your test you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m53s)

[you it raises a red flag and starts to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h12m57s)

[cause me to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m00s)

[question the test and look a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m01s)

[closer so there are ways around this one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m04s)

[you'll note that the test before I just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m08s)

[straight up set the count right if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m10s)

[find that you need to do asserts inside](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m13s)

[of your AR the arrange portion of one of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m16s)

[your tests that sounds like a separate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m18s)

[test that needs to be written right if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m20s)

[you if you if it is important to you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m23s)

[that the the default state of count is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m26s)

[zero right that's a test that is a bit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m29s)

[of behavior about this view model that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m33s)

[you've identified that it is important](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m34s)

[that when this launches the initial](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m37s)

[state is zero right maybe you're going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m39s)

[to open a dialogue or similar right it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m41s)

[not uncommon to say hey I expect that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m43s)

[the initial state of my thingy is X](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m46s)

[great have a test that makes sure that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m49s)

[the initial state of count is zero](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m51s)

[and then get rid of every assert in any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m54s)

[other test that's that's asserting in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m57s)

[the arrange portion you've already](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h13m59s)

[covered it in a different test right you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m00s)

[the the rest of your test can now be fat](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m03s)

[dumb and happy and go you know what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m05s)

[we're going to make that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m08s)

[um we're going to go through and make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m10s)

[that assumption because we've got a test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m12s)

[covering](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m14s)

[it uh let's see uh that is essentially a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m15s)

[pinning test then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m19s)

[right um yeah is is um a couple things I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m21s)

[will show it is so two ways to deal with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m26s)

[this kind of precondition case option](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m31s)

[one uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m33s)

[int before count right this is one way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m35s)

[to write this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m39s)

[test right it's subtle it's very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m44s)

[subtle but I've now guaranteed that I've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m48s)

[gone up by one right I could also do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h14m57s)

[right thank you I like how xuns](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m04s)

[analyzers are smart enough to catch when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m07s)

[I've been stupid um I could do this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m09s)

[literally just move the assert down](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m13s)

[right capture the before cont the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m15s)

[state of it beforehand do the act and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m18s)

[then assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m20s)

[afterwards right right it is a subtle](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m22s)

[change all of these I would argue are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m26s)

[are possible which is correct is very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m29s)

[much going to depend on what you are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m31s)

[testing though and what is important is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m33s)

[it important that the increment count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m35s)

[command started at zero is that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m39s)

[important or is it only important that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m41s)

[the count is incremented by](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m45s)

[one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m48s)

[right because but all of these are good](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m50s)

[ways of testing this but the question is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m53s)

[what is the best way to test this and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m55s)

[what is the behavior that matters I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m57s)

[think this is potentially the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h15m59s)

[best that I don't care where it started](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m02s)

[I just care how it goes for one uh let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m06s)

[see uh I like how mock has set up and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m09s)

[verify on the mock previously used n](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m12s)

[substitute and when doing setup and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m14s)

[verify you end up having to use programs](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m16s)

[to shut up the code analyzers yes yes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m18s)

[and I won't say that it's perfect um you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m21s)

[you do get yourself into a bit of sit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m24s)

[situation where you kind of end up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m26s)

[duplicating yourself a little bit for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m28s)

[example um it is very common to have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m30s)

[your setup and actually I'm glad you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m33s)

[asked this izy this is a good thing to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m36s)

[show off um it is very common to have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m37s)

[the the Lambda in your setup basically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m40s)

[match the Lambda in your verify like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m43s)

[quite often they're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m46s)

[identical um and this gets a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m49s)

[worse too because if these methods start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m51s)

[taking parameters you have to actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m53s)

[fill those in right and we'll get to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m55s)

[that in a second](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m57s)

[um so there is a shorthand here where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h16m59s)

[you can do something like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m03s)

[verifiable right and this is a very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m06s)

[useful thing to use because quite often](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m09s)

[you don't necessarily care about the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m12s)

[number of times something was invoked](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m14s)

[you just want to verify that your setup](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m16s)

[was actually done because uh like in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m18s)

[like the mutation test where things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m23s)

[aren't done I see people who do all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m24s)

[kinds of setups quite often and I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m27s)

[guilty of this too because you watched](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m29s)

[me do it earlier because you've copied](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m31s)

[and pasted the test from just above and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m33s)

[then you've forgotten to delete](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m35s)

[something that you don't need for this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m37s)

[test and now you've got extra stuff in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m38s)

[here that's just worthless and not doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m40s)

[anything right um so a a common idea](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m42s)

[here is you mark the the setup as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m46s)

[verifiable and then you come down here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m49s)

[and you can do uh mock web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m51s)

[service. verify right and this guy goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h17m55s)

[through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m00s)

[and uh jump to it right verifies that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m01s)

[all verifiable expectations have been](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m06s)

[met so it just goes through and says hey](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m09s)

[everything that you flagged is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m11s)

[verifiable I'm going to go through and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m12s)

[just make sure that that was invoked uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m15s)

[at least once because that's a fairly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m17s)

[common thing to do that way you don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m19s)

[have to write all of these verif I you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m21s)

[can just say yeah I just want to make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m23s)

[sure that it done and sometimes if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m25s)

[get real lazy real real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m28s)

[lazy you can just do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m31s)

[this right verifi verifies all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m35s)

[expectations regardless of whether](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m40s)

[they've been flagged as verifiable or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m42s)

[not right I I actually was talking with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m43s)

[a colleague a while back and I I I I I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m47s)

[posited the idea that verify all might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m50s)

[be the most overused horrible thing that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m53s)

[people can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m56s)

[Implement because quite of like verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h18m57s)

[all is great this is great shorthand](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m02s)

[synex I didn't have to do do verifiable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m04s)

[I got the same behavior as do verify and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m07s)

[a lot less typing great the problem is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m09s)

[verify all verifies all setups were](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m13s)

[matched and there it is not uncommon to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m17s)

[have some setups](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m21s)

[that are directly related to your test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m23s)

[and a few setups that are maybe that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m26s)

[maybe aren't related to your test for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m29s)

[example you have a dependency and maybe](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m31s)

[something is used in The Constructor but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m34s)

[then also something else is now used in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m37s)

[the the method that you're testing well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m39s)

[you have to do the setup for the thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m41s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m42s)

[Constructor but what you but the only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m43s)

[thing you actually care about is the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m45s)

[thing that's being done in the method](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m47s)

[that you're testing so verify all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m48s)

[totally feel free to use it but again it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m53s)

[is it comes with a cost so be aware of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h19m56s)

[that um only verify all if legitimately](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m00s)

[you want to verify all right if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m05s)

[everything that you're setting up on is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m07s)

[directly in the the path of the unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m09s)

[that you're testing because again unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m12s)

[test is test a single unit that doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m14s)

[necessarily mean single method though](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m17s)

[often it does a single logical unit like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m19s)

[with all of this testing stuff I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m23s)

[logical units the best way I can phrase](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m24s)

[it is as long as things are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m26s)

[logically one thing I don't care how](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m29s)

[many methods there are right at a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m32s)

[certain point it gets really hard to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m35s)

[justify that these 10 methods are one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m36s)

[logical unit but you know depends right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m39s)

[it's hard to say without seeing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m43s)

[examples](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m49s)

[okay there is I think the importance of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m50s)

[mock in a nutshell setup setup sequence](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m53s)

[returns oh one other one other key](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m56s)

[method I'm going to point out let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h20m58s)

[imagine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m01s)

[like right now we are we are doing some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m03s)

[assertions on the the data expectation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m07s)

[let's imagine that we actually care](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m11s)

[about the order of these invocations](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m13s)

[like perhaps the order](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m15s)

[matters right maybe we're invoking a web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m17s)

[service to some third party and you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m19s)

[we want to make sure that you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m23s)

[there's a start operation and a stop](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m25s)

[operation right but we want to make sure](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m27s)

[that start comes first right that may](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m30s)

[maybe like just verifying that both](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m33s)

[calls were done doesn't guarantee the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m36s)

[order of the calls now mock doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m38s)

[necessarily give you an easy way to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m40s)

[this however there's an escape hatch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m43s)

[where you can do whatever you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m45s)

[want right so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m47s)

[uh on all of your mock there is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m50s)

[callback guy in here now the thing I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m54s)

[will point out this is one of the few](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m57s)

[methods inside of the mock library that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h21m59s)

[is in fact a delegate right not an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m01s)

[expression and the key thing here with a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m05s)

[delegate you can do curly braces right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m07s)

[Expressions basically have to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m10s)

[oneliner they're Expressions but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m12s)

[delegates you can put whatever you want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m14s)

[you can invoke another method if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m17s)

[want have at it the only thing that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m18s)

[matters here is the the signature of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m21s)

[your call back needs to be matching what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m23s)

[this is right in this case no parameters](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m26s)

[no parameters if this you know took a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m28s)

[string I might do you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m30s)

[string boo right something something to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m34s)

[that effect right so the signature needs](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m37s)

[to match um I believe you also can work](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m41s)

[if if it takes parameter I think it'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m44s)

[also happily take empty and just know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m46s)

[that that means drop but I think your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m48s)

[choice is either match all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m50s)

[or uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m53s)

[none but inside of this call back here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m55s)

[right uh we can do something like Bool](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h22m58s)

[uh get XML called right and so we can do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m01s)

[something like get XML called gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m06s)

[true](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m10s)

[uh right this is functionally now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m11s)

[getting us down to a single invocation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m15s)

[because we can't be called twice right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m17s)

[but we can also do something like you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m20s)

[know get Json called right and now down](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m22s)

[in here we can do something something a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m26s)

[little more to this get Json](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m29s)

[called we can do something similar hey](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m32s)

[co-pilot write the rest of this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m35s)

[implementation for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m36s)

[me come on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m37s)

[co-pilot nothing you know you're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m40s)

[going to do it for me here let me help](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m43s)

[you assert true get XML called do the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m44s)

[rest thank you thank you you've been](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m49s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m52s)

[um so now we can actually go through and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m54s)

[start asserting and say oh okay well get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h23m57s)

[XML should be called first therefore](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m00s)

[this assert is failing and you can see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m03s)

[we're blowing up right on this line](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m05s)

[right so now if we come over here and we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m07s)

[go well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m09s)

[okay in this case I'm positing that get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m11s)

[XML is like start the other one stop and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m13s)

[now we are actually asserting on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m16s)

[order of the call so if you need to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m18s)

[anything fancy at all the call back is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m20s)

[more or less Mock's escape hatch for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m23s)

[yeah we we didn't cover that do do what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m25s)

[you need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m27s)

[um oh yeah so showing the package](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m32s)

[reference for the mock Library do the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m35s)

[GitHub sponsor thing yeah so what Izzy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m37s)

[is referencing is there was a version of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m39s)

[the mock library that went](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m41s)

[out few months ago um that contained](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m44s)

[what many people considered malware](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m50s)

[or at least deceptive practices of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m53s)

[potentially capturing uh user](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m55s)

[information that change has since been](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h24m58s)

[reverted there's actually even a flag on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m00s)

[nuget.org marking it as a vulnerable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m02s)

[package to to to strongly strongly uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m05s)

[hint to people uh to update it um the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m09s)

[the current oh that didn't show my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m15s)

[version I'm using centralized package](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m17s)

[management so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m21s)

[the the mock version that I'm on uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m23s)

[42069 which I don't know if that's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m27s)

[joke because right after right after the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m29s)

[the whole mock Fiasco the um the author](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m31s)

[released multiple updates fairly rapidly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m36s)

[and he changed his version numbering](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m38s)

[scheme at the same time I don't really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m40s)

[know why um but we can go ahead and grab](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m42s)

[this yeah I I believe 69 and later is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m48s)

[all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m53s)

[safe don't quote me on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m55s)

[that always do your due diligence and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h25m59s)

[double check but I believe 69 and later](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m02s)

[is good um that's that's just what I've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m04s)

[plugged um into my net templates and I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m07s)

[should probably release an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m11s)

[update](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m12s)

[um yeah so I I believe if we go back](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m15s)

[because the mock library is straight up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m18s)

[open source so if anybody's ever](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m21s)

[questioning what is what is actually in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m23s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m26s)

[the yeah so you can see especially after](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m30s)

[that Fiasco happened like one I feel a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m33s)

[little bad for the author because the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m36s)

[open source Community just like he got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m38s)

[reamed hard um but it also meant that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m41s)

[people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m45s)

[are paying real close attention and so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m48s)

[there's been a lot of changes that have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m51s)

[gone in recently uh let me look at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m55s)

[because I think the release notes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h26m57s)

[on yeah so you'll note specifically the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m03s)

[thing that people were unhappy about was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m06s)

[the sponsor link stuff inside because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m07s)

[that's what was capturing user](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m11s)

[information prompting for sponsorship](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m14s)

[etc etc etc](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m17s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m20s)

[uh yeah so there is all of that stuff so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m23s)

[42069 is where it got stripped out if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m28s)

[anybody doesn't believe him like you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m30s)

[you can check the actual commits to see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m32s)

[the the changes in the diffs that have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m34s)

[gone in there um and all of these things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m36s)

[do here and there's been a lot of people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m39s)

[looking into it so if anybody is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m41s)

[questioning it I mean the other thing as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m44s)

[well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m46s)

[it's potentially worth noting like in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m49s)

[lot lot of cases people really](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m51s)

[should um be locking down their build](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m55s)

[agents because if your build agent is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h27m58s)

[it there's potentially a problem there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h28m53s)

[nature okay let's do auto marcker okay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m00s)

[of all I got to show something off one I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m06s)

[have been annoyed for quite some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m09s)

[time that when you go here we do not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m12s)

[have an icon this bothers me our package](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m14s)

[has 12 million bloody downloads and we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m18s)

[don't even have an icon](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m20s)

[that's very sad there is an open poll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m22s)

[request](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m25s)

[Now with an icon and I am now happy uh I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m26s)

[I will point out I am not a UI](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m31s)

[designer um so take it with a grain of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m34s)

[salt I I blatantly poached the the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m38s)

[actual mock icon and tweaked it I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m41s)

[you can probably guess what the tweaks](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m43s)

[are um and and made a made a pretty icon](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m45s)

[so because frankly this this is a pretty](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m50s)

[low bar to beat this is a pretty low bar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m52s)

[coffee you know what I'm going to take](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h29m59s)

[that as a a compliment and I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m01s)

[that's success because anything that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m03s)

[induces caffeine intake is probably good](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m05s)

[so there is hopefully an icon coming](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m08s)

[there so I'm going to show you guys what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m10s)

[is current prod on automaker and then I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m13s)

[stuff that's coming in next release](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m17s)

[because this this is where things start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m19s)

[to get real fun so most people are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m21s)

[familiar with mock mock has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m24s)

[significantly more downloads than Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m25s)

[marer there's other libraries that plug](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m27s)

[in with mock to give you similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m29s)

[functionality let me show you what Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m31s)

[mocker does and then I will uh show you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m33s)

[a few of the small things that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m37s)

[let's let's take our first test um and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m45s)

[I'm going to put a uh uh am on the end](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m49s)

[of it for auto marker just just so it it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m53s)

[executes this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m55s)

[here th this is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h30m57s)

[auto marer is designed to solve is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m00s)

[Constructors are like static uh methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m02s)

[or Mountain Dew yes is he exactly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m06s)

[speaking of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m08s)

[which first one down you won't be able](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m11s)

[to see it due to the green screen but I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m14s)

[promise there's a second one in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m16s)

[Q um Constructors are basically static](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m18s)

[methods right they their their job in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m22s)

[life is to take in an instance of an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m25s)

[object and initialize up all its](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m26s)

[variables that's that's what they do but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m28s)

[they are not virtual they are not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m32s)

[overridable you cannot do that and that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m34s)

[means that uh wherever you invoke a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m36s)

[static method there's some coupling](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m40s)

[there some tight](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m42s)

[coupling and with dependency injection](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m43s)

[people try to break away so that they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m47s)

[aren't using the new keyword very much](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m49s)

[right because the moment you call new on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m52s)

[something you're tightly coupling the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m54s)

[thing that's calling new with the thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m56s)

[that it instantiated right there is now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h31m59s)

[a tight coupling there is that bad that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m01s)

[depends right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m03s)

[but ideally if we don't have to do that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m05s)

[and we can leverage our di container and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m09s)

[and do some sort of fancy injection](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m11s)

[that's better now the problem being is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m13s)

[for testing we don't really want to just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m17s)

[instantiate up a DI container because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m19s)

[there's nothing cing you inside of these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m21s)

[tests from doing something like service](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m23s)

[collection you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m26s)

[collection all right and then we can go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m29s)

[through and do you know collection add](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m31s)

[single T like there's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m34s)

[us from doing this right oh go go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m35s)

[co-pilot go right and then you could do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m38s)

[you know main window view model VM gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m41s)

[get get require ired service right of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m49s)

[main window view mod like nothing is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m54s)

[stopping you from doing this whole thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m56s)

[right uh or in and then if you're not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h32m59s)

[using the Microsoft di container insert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m01s)

[di container of choice](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m04s)

[right um this this is a thing you could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m06s)

[do this is very heavy-handed and unless](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m10s)

[you're trying to test your di](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m12s)

[configuration which I think everyone](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m14s)

[should uh to make sure that you've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m16s)

[appropriately registered](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m18s)

[everything this doesn't do you uh this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m20s)

[is kind of painful and more often than](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m23s)

[not like we're adding Singletons in here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m26s)

[but I don't want in some cases I might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m28s)

[want the real implementation in a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m30s)

[cases I probably just want to put a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m33s)

[in instead right so rather than doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m35s)

[rather than doing this maneuver what I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m38s)

[might want to do is something more like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m40s)

[this right where I start where I start](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m42s)

[injecting all of this stuff and building](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m45s)

[it out but like the service collection](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m47s)

[class you have to register all the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m49s)

[things like the the Microsoft di](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m52s)

[container doesn't have some of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m55s)

[features that other di containers have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m57s)

[where it like scans the assembly and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h33m59s)

[does some Auto registering and all that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m01s)

[jazz no no no you tell it exactly what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m02s)

[you want and it goes got it these are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m05s)

[this and only this is what I know about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m08s)

[I will build the things right that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m11s)

[that's it like it's it's fast and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m13s)

[efficient and it only does exactly what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m16s)

[you've told it no more right that's why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m18s)

[some people like other di libraries](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m20s)

[because they come with more features and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m22s)

[you can do other stuff right so if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m24s)

[care about those features find a third](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m26s)

[party library that has the feature you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m29s)

[care about and use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m30s)

[it okay what Auto mocker does is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m32s)

[effectively this with a lot less](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m37s)

[work right so for example Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m40s)

[marer uh mocker gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m45s)

[new I'm just going to kill all this off](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m48s)

[right and then rather than and this line](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m52s)

[here is the problematic line because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m54s)

[this is the static if we were to go and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m56s)

[add another Constructor parameter we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h34m58s)

[would have to go through every single](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m00s)

[one of these tests and fix them to add](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m02s)

[in that new parameter that is a pain in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m05s)

[the butt especially since if I just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m08s)

[because I add a new parameter it might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m10s)

[be for a different method it might not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m11s)

[be related to the increment count](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m13s)

[command at all why am I touching this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m15s)

[test right this test should only need to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m17s)

[change if something around the increment](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m19s)

[count command needs to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m22s)

[change right so what autom marer does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m23s)

[uh I have a library that adds scanning](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m28s)

[and registers forwarding factories for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m30s)

[Microsoft](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m32s)

[yeah um something you wrote yourself](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m34s)

[iszy or something or third party one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m36s)

[that you pulled in because I think I've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m38s)

[seen a lot of people do very similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m40s)

[because it's a common thing that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m43s)

[everyone](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m45s)

[wants](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m50s)

[and look at that it works it just works](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m52s)

[okay so Auto marer is more or less a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h35m56s)

[think of it as a lightweight di](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m07s)

[in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m13s)

[fact I service provider P gets mocker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m14s)

[mocker actually implements](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m19s)

[don't have to use it right and I will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m25s)

[caution people this has actually been a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m29s)

[source of many bugs for us is because we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m30s)

[implemented I service provider which I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m33s)

[service provider is a very simple](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m36s)

[interface it has get service that's it I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m38s)

[wrote it back in net core 111 days oh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m42s)

[cool um I service provider is very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m46s)

[okay Auto marer implements it it does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m52s)

[not behave like the service provider](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m55s)

[class so for example people have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h36m57s)

[complained that we don't have the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m00s)

[equivalent of like ad scoped right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m02s)

[because Auto marer again is more or less](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m05s)

[a dictionary and we we functionally](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m07s)

[things are Singleton like everything in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m10s)

[autom marer is Singleton I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m12s)

[put a little asteris because that's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m14s)

[lie but functionally if you just think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m15s)

[of everything inside your autom marer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m17s)

[instance as a Singleton that's it right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m19s)

[so first feature decouples from your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m23s)

[Constructor so you no longer have to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m26s)

[all that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m28s)

[garbage okay uh Let's do let's do the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m30s)

[next one right uh one other thing I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m33s)

[going to call out I see a lot of people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m35s)

[they really like to take their arranged](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m38s)

[portion of their test and move it into a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m40s)

[common setup that is mostly fine um with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m43s)

[a few caveats that I will call out one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m47s)

[of avoid Statics because I've seen](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m51s)

[people put their mocks in like static](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m53s)

[Fields that's a great way to shoot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m55s)

[yourself in the foot don't do that um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m56s)

[it's okay to new up new instances right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h37m59s)

[some people I've seen they store a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m02s)

[static field and in their setup they do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m04s)

[like a reset on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m05s)

[mock stop it right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m07s)

[like are are you trying to like unless](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m10s)

[you've got something that shows that you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m14s)

[need to save that little bit of memory](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m16s)

[allocation and therefore that's why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m18s)

[you're doing that no](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m19s)

[no just new Done Right new instance per](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m21s)

[test it will save you a a new instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m25s)

[per test will save you a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m28s)

[headaches a lot of headaches um because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m29s)

[Statics things tend to get leaked](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m33s)

[especially people turn on executing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m35s)

[stuff in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m37s)

[parallel yeah like too many people rely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m38s)

[on the fact that each um thing is going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m41s)

[to be a separate and they're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m43s)

[run sequentially don't do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m45s)

[that uh so in general I don't mind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m47s)

[seeing people putting like setup stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m50s)

[like this in their setup but like don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m52s)

[share instances and anything you put in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m56s)

[the setup for your class make sure it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h38m58s)

[actually applies to every test in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m00s)

[class if it doesn't apply to every test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m01s)

[and only applies to most of them just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m04s)

[make a method right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m06s)

[private private void my setup that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m10s)

[only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m15s)

[applies](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m16s)

[sometimes right done like and then just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m18s)

[invoke this in all the places like you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m21s)

[aggressively refactor your test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m24s)

[but don't do bad things uh because it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m26s)

[just as bad to have your setup allocate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m29s)

[and set up a whole bunch of stuff and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m31s)

[then not use it in a test so if it's not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m33s)

[going to be used in a test knock it off](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m35s)

[uh that's also another place where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m37s)

[verify all bites people left and right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m38s)

[is they put a verify all and then they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m40s)

[do setups in a common method and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m42s)

[realize oh shoot that didn't work](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m44s)

[because I needed a setup there but I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m46s)

[only needed it for this test but not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m48s)

[this other one yeah just don't do that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m50s)

[just separate them it's it's not that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m52s)

[bad okay so let's let's look at this one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m54s)

[right so you'll note very quickly that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m56s)

[my default setting for no co-pilot uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h39m58s)

[all my tests is more or less the first](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m02s)

[line is instantiate new auto marer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m04s)

[instance that's basically it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m06s)

[um dang co-pilot yeah that's that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m11s)

[pretty close so you'll you'll note](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m14s)

[here uh autom marer has a method on it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m17s)

[for get mock right there's there's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m20s)

[couple other methods that are worth](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m22s)

[calling out get as well um will just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m23s)

[retrieve an instance you can think of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m27s)

[this as more more or less uh akin to the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m29s)

[mock of type method type situation um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m33s)

[what the the big difference between Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m37s)

[mocker and like a regular di container](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m39s)

[Auto marer if you ask it for something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m42s)

[and it doesn't already have something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m45s)

[stored for it it's going to try to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m47s)

[create you a mock and give you you that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m49s)

[back instead so it's kind of like a DI](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m51s)

[container with a fall back that says](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m54s)

[yeah just just mock it just mock it just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m56s)

[mock it right it all it has some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h40m59s)

[built-in behavior for things like lazy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m01s)

[Funk action um a bunch of those Commish](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m03s)

[things and but by default if it gets all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m07s)

[the way through its list of things that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m11s)

[it's going to try one of the last ones](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m12s)

[on the list is yeah just just shell out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m14s)

[to Mock and use that instance so if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m16s)

[call git you're going to get an instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m19s)

[it should be non-null in most cases](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m23s)

[we'll get into resolvers in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m25s)

[moment but the the idea being that it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m27s)

[makes it is an easy way to do it so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m30s)

[quite often if you are looking to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m32s)

[between old Mock and new one you will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m34s)

[note that this setup sequence here with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m37s)

[these returns async are basically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m40s)

[identical um there's one key difference](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m44s)

[here in the fact that this one had mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m46s)

[behavior of strict](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m49s)

[and if you just call get mock it is not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m51s)

[going to give you a strict mock right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m54s)

[you you get you get only one the other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h41m57s)

[thing that it does give you is auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m00s)

[marer um will go after uh private](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m02s)

[Constructors for things if you tell it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m06s)

[to right there is a Boolean flag to say](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m08s)

[enable private to say hey when you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m11s)

[when you're using reflection to look at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m14s)

[this type yeah include the private](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m16s)

[Constructors as well because we'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m18s)

[actually leverage those to go in and get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m21s)

[them so it it tries to give you those](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m23s)

[extra things now if you want a strict](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m25s)

[mock there are a couple ways to go about](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m28s)

[getting it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m30s)

[one um the the auto marer instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m32s)

[itself does take in a mock Behavior and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m36s)

[the mock Behavior will get used anytime](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m40s)

[it falls back to Mock and says create me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m42s)

[a new mock is it will grab that behavior](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m45s)

[and go ah I'm making a new mock my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m47s)

[default behavior is great strict now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m49s)

[that may be Overkill because maybe you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m52s)

[don't want all your mocks being](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m55s)

[strict because if I were to turn this on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h42m57s)

[you'll note here we have one strict Mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m00s)

[and one loose Mock and so there's not a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m03s)

[good way for me to specify either here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m06s)

[or here the other thing that you can do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m08s)

[is you can just go uh mocker use and you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m11s)

[can go ahead and send it a new mock of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m15s)

[ieb service and you can certainly do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m18s)

[mock behavior. strict right we can just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m20s)

[tell it hey by the way use this mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m24s)

[instance and you're Off to the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m28s)

[Races right and you'll note the there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m30s)

[multiple use overloads but there's very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m33s)

[specifically a use overload for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m36s)

[mock right so if you feed it in a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m39s)

[it's going to it's going to register up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m42s)

[on the uh the mock service type not on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m44s)

[the type of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m48s)

[mock just for reference so it cues it up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m49s)

[here um and then when you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m51s)

[call down here when we do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m54s)

[mocker when you spell it correctly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h43m57s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m00s)

[important when you do mocker create](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m01s)

[instance mean when new view model B](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m07s)

[boom right all auto marer is going to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m09s)

[is leverage the um the mock that is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m13s)

[stored inside of it to' be able to pull](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m16s)

[this back now this this is obviously](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m18s)

[failing because this is no longer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m20s)

[useful um and if we want to do this we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m23s)

[can go mocker and then mock even so you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m26s)

[have two choices with auto marcker is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m30s)

[there are convenience methods on auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m33s)

[marer directly for things like setup](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m35s)

[verify Etc if you don't want to use the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m38s)

[convenience method you can always just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m41s)

[get the mock back out and then do just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m44s)

[normal mocky things on it right you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m46s)

[don't have to use the convenience](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m48s)

[methods however the convenience methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m49s)

[do make it really easy because now I can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m51s)

[do that and I can say hey mocker verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m53s)

[and it knows when I call mocker verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h44m57s)

[okay reach inside find the mock of I web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m00s)

[service here's the uh the expression](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m02s)

[that I want you to pass to the verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m05s)

[method on that mock go ahead and do it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m07s)

[for me right and then the most OP broken](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m08s)

[thing from before right mocker verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m12s)

[all again be real cautious with this if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m16s)

[you call verify all make absolutely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m19s)

[certain that you actually want to verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m22s)

[all on all the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m25s)

[setups right I I think this method gets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m27s)

[overused a lot in places where people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m29s)

[over assert on in their test rather than](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m34s)

[thinking about what is the behavior I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m36s)

[care about so if in fact you really do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m38s)

[want to verify on all your setups great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m41s)

[fine it's a great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m43s)

[convenience but the important thing with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m45s)

[mocker is when you call things like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m47s)

[verify all it's going to iterate through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m49s)

[every mock that it knows about and go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m53s)

[through and do it because it's keeping](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m56s)

[track of all of those things if you look](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m57s)

[at uh mocker uh resolve the objects you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h45m59s)

[will see this guy here oh I got it is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m03s)

[dictionary of type object this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m06s)

[everything mock knows about and is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m09s)

[tracking so either objects that got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m11s)

[objects will make it into this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m15s)

[dictionary because they were](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m16s)

[dependencies of something that was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m17s)

[instantiating](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m19s)

[right so call calls to main window view](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m21s)

[model will instantiate it or if you do a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m23s)

[call to use that just manually puts](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m25s)

[something into that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m28s)

[dictionary right so when you when you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m29s)

[ask Auto marer for something one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m32s)

[things it will do is do I already have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m34s)

[one of those things in my dictionary oh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m36s)

[I do let's just use that which is why I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m38s)

[say functionally if you think about Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m41s)

[marcker as just a dictionary of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m43s)

[things conceptually you're going to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m46s)

[right more often than not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m49s)

[is that's typically the way it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m50s)

[resolving I'm hedging there because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m53s)

[there's there's an extension point that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m54s)

[I that I want to show](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m56s)

[off so going through and doing this you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h46m58s)

[can always do get mock I think we um we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m01s)

[can also go here and just say you know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m06s)

[what rather than pulling the mock out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m08s)

[I'm just going to do setup sequence](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m11s)

[you'll note whenever you use the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m13s)

[convenience mocker the the convenience](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m14s)

[method directly on mocker you do end up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m16s)

[having to specify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m19s)

[generics on it because Auto marer can't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m21s)

[infer from just the um the Lambda what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m24s)

[mock type because it's tracking a whole](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m31s)

[dictionary thing so you kind of have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m32s)

[you have to give it the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m34s)

[um the generic parameters so that it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m37s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m40s)

[knows what uh what thing we're actually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m41s)

[talking about and again you can either](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m45s)

[do it like this or you can just pull the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m47s)

[mock out and and act on the mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m49s)

[directly um uh if we mock a thing that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m51s)

[has dependencies are those also mocked](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m54s)

[and can I pull those out for assertions](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m57s)

[in my test uh so the answer is is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h47m59s)

[probably and yes so if there are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m04s)

[dependencies it um so specifically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m07s)

[create instance is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m11s)

[recursive right so it will it will look](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m13s)

[at create instance will look at your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m16s)

[Constructors um order them by the number](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m18s)

[whichever ones have the most parameters](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m21s)

[and operate in reverse order there and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m23s)

[then as long as it can find one where it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m25s)

[can resolve all of the types it will use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m28s)

[it anything that it resolves it will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m30s)

[cach in its](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m34s)

[dictionary so it will it will pull those](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m35s)

[things in and hold on to them in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m38s)

[dictionary for use later anything in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m40s)

[that dictionary you can pull back out so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m42s)

[uh either with a a mocker doget or a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m45s)

[mocker doget mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m48s)

[um get mock will fail if you try to pull](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m50s)

[out a thing that isn't in fact a mock so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m53s)

[if if something injected something that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m56s)

[wasn't a mock and then you try to pull](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h48m59s)

[it out as a mock it'll go I no it's not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m01s)

[a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m03s)

[bad um yeah testing a but Asser that it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m05s)

[called B which I didn't set up yeah so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m09s)

[yeah so if you don't do a setup the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m13s)

[there is nothing stopping you from doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m15s)

[like for example this guy has two](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m18s)

[dependencies in here so it's going to uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m21s)

[mock out I web service and my DB](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m26s)

[context technically the mocking of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m29s)

[web service is uh it's going to use this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m31s)

[instance here but there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m34s)

[is uh there will be two items in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m37s)

[dictionary at the very end in fact we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m39s)

[can just do this real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m41s)

[quick and so if if you wanted to do an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m43s)

[assertion on the um the DB Contex](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m46s)

[text we go here and we look at the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m50s)

[resolved](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m53s)

[objects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m54s)

[um oh I missed it okay we're just going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m56s)

[to go to the watch window because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h49m59s)

[frankly this is getting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m01s)

[annoying uh mocker dot yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m02s)

[fine shut up boom right so we can see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m06s)

[the the two items that are in there and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m10s)

[they are both mocks so I do have a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m13s)

[of my DB context so if I wanted to I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m15s)

[could certainly come down here and do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m18s)

[mocker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m19s)

[get mock pull](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m20s)

[out uh my DB context and and go through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m23s)

[here um it will attempt if it's un so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m27s)

[this is one of those areas where where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m31s)

[Auto marker will try to do its best but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m33s)

[it can't always tell the difference](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m35s)

[between whether you want recursive](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m37s)

[create instance Behavior or whether you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m39s)

[want it to mock a concrete type so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m41s)

[occasionally you do have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m45s)

[intentionally shove in an instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m47s)

[because it doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m49s)

[know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m51s)

[um uh it doesn't know what Behavior you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m53s)

[are intending for so so create instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h50m57s)

[is recursive it will shove things into](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m00s)

[that dictionary that it uses to resolve](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m04s)

[those um and you can pull any of them](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m06s)

[out afterwards so yes uh the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m08s)

[dependencies are probably mocked again](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m11s)

[if it's a dependency of like lazy of tea](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m15s)

[you're not going to get mocked of lazy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m17s)

[of tea autom marer is going to see the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m19s)

[lazy of T and I'll show you how it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m21s)

[handles that in a moment but it will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m23s)

[it'll actually put a lazy instance in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m25s)

[let's see uh type should not be examined](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m27s)

[on system type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m29s)

[instances uh yes I assume you're talking](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m31s)

[about for type matching or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m34s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m37s)

[um uh correct like this resolved objects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m40s)

[this is largely there for debugging](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m46s)

[purposes and as an escape hatch when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m50s)

[somebody needs to do something that we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m53s)

[didn't think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m55s)

[of yeah type of uh type get type yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h51m56s)

[yeah don't do that because that that now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m01s)

[you've gotten yourself into a weird](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m03s)

[situation um that that's largely what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m05s)

[these resolved objects are here for and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m07s)

[quite often for debugging it's quite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m10s)

[useful to be able to see hey what are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m12s)

[the things that it knows about why did](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m14s)

[it plug that thing in for like mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m16s)

[objects in the debug you can then dive](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m18s)

[in and start looking at um in case](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m20s)

[people haven't seen this before like for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m24s)

[example uh what did we call here get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m25s)

[data Command right so I can come into](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m28s)

[web service um I can get into the mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m29s)

[instance on the mock instance itself you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m32s)

[can actually like start diving into the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m35s)

[invocations and you can see which calls](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m37s)

[were actually made on your mock now it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m39s)

[requires kind of digging through the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m42s)

[expressions and the storage of it but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m44s)

[having these things available and shown](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m47s)

[is part of the motivation for why](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m49s)

[they're there it's if you find yourself](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m50s)

[having to go to the to that dictionary a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m53s)

[lot for something please open a a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m55s)

[feature request or something on the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m57s)

[autom marker library because for a while](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h52m59s)

[it was internal but we made it public](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m02s)

[because there was a handful of people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m04s)

[that want to do some wacky stuff um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m05s)

[which is fine but ideally if there if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m08s)

[you've got a valid use case we we might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m11s)

[want to handle it a different way than](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m14s)

[going directly at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m15s)

[it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m18s)

[yeah I've been trying to use mock for a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m20s)

[while now yeah and mock itself is good](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m22s)

[it just doesn't give all this extra fun](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m25s)

[this in my opinion adds](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m27s)

[the the stuff that makes the testing a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m30s)

[lot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m32s)

[easier um uh and a lot nice to work with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m33s)

[Okay the one other thing I want to call](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m37s)

[out is quite often people will will ask](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m38s)

[for things where they're like you know I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m41s)

[want to do some custom Behavior to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m43s)

[create object of type Fu right and I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m45s)

[mentioned that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m48s)

[the my kind of my little asteris of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m55s)

[uh let's see in the interest of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h53m59s)

[simplified](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m10s)

[some context into which of my statements](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m15s)

[that's referencing though uh if you make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m17s)

[documentation of this Library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m32s)

[sucks um it's been on my backlog of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m34s)

[things that I want to fix for a while](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m36s)

[and uh with my plethora of free time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m39s)

[I've never gotten to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m41s)

[it so hopefully this video serves as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m44s)

[some help to certain people for it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m48s)

[um so inside of the mocker instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m51s)

[there is this concept of a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m53s)

[resolver right and this is what when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m56s)

[autom marker goes to create a thing what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h54m59s)

[it does is it actually walks through](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m02s)

[this list of resolvers and you'll note](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m04s)

[here if we go back to our watch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m06s)

[window there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m09s)

[are by default a bunch of resolvers](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m11s)

[plugged in but there's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m14s)

[you this is just a list you can add or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m16s)

[remove things from this list and have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m18s)

[fun right this is this is how you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m21s)

[start customizing Auto marer and have it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m23s)

[behave the way you want so again when](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m26s)

[you ask Auto mocker for a thing the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m29s)

[first thing it does like if you do auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m32s)

[if you do mocker doget and you ask it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m34s)

[and you ask it for a thing the first](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m37s)

[thing it's going to do is it's going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m38s)

[uh use the cash resolver and say okay is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m41s)

[it a thing in my cash if it is great I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m43s)

[going to use that right if it's not in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m46s)

[the cash](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m49s)

[uh it uses a self resolver and this one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m50s)

[here says resolve anything that asks for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m52s)

[an auto marer instance like if you do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m55s)

[auto marer get and you ask for auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h55m57s)

[marer it returns itself back out I know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m00s)

[it sounds weird to do that but there's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m03s)

[handful of cases in like di container](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m05s)

[stuff where that's actually kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m07s)

[helpful so we plugged in a default](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m08s)

[resolver for it there are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m10s)

[arrays if something is asking for an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m14s)

[array of a of t an auto marker knows how](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m17s)

[to do the T it will populate the array](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m20s)

[for you and so rather than getting a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m23s)

[mock you'll get an array that contains a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m24s)

[thing that auto marker knows about great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m27s)

[kind of what you want or you'll get like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m30s)

[a ray dot empty great wonderful we we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m31s)

[like having empty things drop in if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m34s)

[you're trying to test like uh maybe](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m37s)

[command line parsing you're passing in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m39s)

[string ARS you probably want to inject](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m40s)

[it with an array field with the strings](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m41s)

[you care about but whatever right it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m43s)

[up to you um we're going to skip](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m45s)

[disposable innumerable B basically works](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m47s)

[the same way as aray only on I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m50s)

[inumerable uh lazy and Funk So for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m51s)

[anybody who has watched my di videos](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m54s)

[where I show off um using like Funk and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h56m58s)

[lazy as a a lightweight Factory for for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m01s)

[a DI container Auto marer will just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m05s)

[handle those parameters for you so if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m07s)

[you have a view model that takes a funk](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m09s)

[of you know my dialogue view model for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m13s)

[example Auto marker will see that and go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m15s)

[I got you what you want me to inject is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m18s)

[a funk that calls back into me asking](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m21s)

[for my dialogue view model and so it'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m23s)

[build up a funk or a similar lazy right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m26s)

[because lazy is just a wrapper around a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m28s)

[funk um so it'll build one of those up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m30s)

[and inject those for you if you have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m32s)

[something that takes in a cancellation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m34s)

[token it will shove in a cancellation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m36s)

[token for you you'll get cancellation](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m38s)

[token none but hey it's at least](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m40s)

[something there and then the very last](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m42s)

[thing is the thing that says okay I give](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m44s)

[up I didn't find anything I want Wanted](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m47s)

[let's shell out to the mock resolver](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m50s)

[instead right and this is where where it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m52s)

[actually shells out and says okay inq](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m54s)

[give me a mock of this thing and it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m57s)

[important to note the uh mock of T has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h57m59s)

[limitations on what it will let you mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m03s)

[right like if you try I de feed it in a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m06s)

[sealed class it's going to yell at you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m08s)

[and go n and it blows up and auto marker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m09s)

[can't fix that right because at the end](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m13s)

[of the day the mock resolver is shelling](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m15s)

[out to the mock Library and at that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m17s)

[point it's on the mock library to handle](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m19s)

[things and things for Castle Dynamic](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m21s)

[proxy are similar let's see uh can typ](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m24s)

[of return the actual type instead of uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m27s)

[the current POV of that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m31s)

[object not sure I understand so if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m36s)

[you're talking about going through like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m41s)

[that dictionary where it's uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m42s)

[mocker resolved objects typically what I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m45s)

[would find is if you're looking to pull](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m48s)

[something out like this and you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m50s)

[trying to say well okay of type I web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m52s)

[service Etc like if you find you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m55s)

[you're doing this it's like well this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m58s)

[isn't matching Because the actual value](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h58m59s)

[is a mock of ieb service and all of that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m01s)

[stuff the much like in general you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m03s)

[not you are not expected to go to this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m07s)

[dictionary directly right this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m10s)

[dictionary is only exposed because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m12s)

[people found it useful to be able to see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m15s)

[it um and help Di no it it's not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m17s)

[something you're you're typically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m20s)

[expected to use a much simpler option is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m21s)

[just called mock or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m24s)

[get right I web service that will deal](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m25s)

[with looking in the dictionary if if the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m29s)

[stored thing is a real instance it'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m32s)

[give that back if it's a mock it'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m34s)

[unwrap it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m36s)

[um uh if I pass a to a function in the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m38s)

[function I do uh type of on the is it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m42s)

[the art typ not type of a oh oh I I got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m45s)

[you um that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m50s)

[so there is so I I think let me see if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m54s)

[I've if I'm actually following this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=01h59m58s)

[correctly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m00s)

[um I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m02s)

[it's if you do something like mock of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m06s)

[right there is a there is a a difference](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m09s)

[between](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m12s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m13s)

[T1 type of I web service and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m15s)

[uh this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m20s)

[right uh yeah but we'll show what the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m24s)

[real type is so I I think this is kind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m28s)

[of what you're driving at of what of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m30s)

[what the subtle difference is between](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m32s)

[the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m34s)

[oh adding code in the middle of a debug](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m36s)

[session doesn't work well](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m38s)

[um right of what you of what you end up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m41s)

[seeing so for example the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m43s)

[uh local locals locals why why are my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m47s)

[locals not open all stack breakpoint](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m50s)

[section Autos not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m53s)

[all uh that's not quite what I want okay](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h00m56s)

[locals give me my local](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m00s)

[window come](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m02s)

[on thank you there we go so for example](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m04s)

[uh T1](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m09s)

[T2 right uh so T1 is showing I web](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m11s)

[service versus T2 which is the actual](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m16s)

[underlying Castle Dynamic proxy type a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m20s)

[similar thing will happen with with mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m24s)

[of of being able to look at it is so if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m26s)

[you look at it in the debugger window](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m29s)

[you will get the equivalent of uh Fu get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m31s)

[type because you'll be looking at the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m35s)

[runtime type of what it is if you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m36s)

[using something like a a type of type of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m38s)

[is resolved at compile time so it has to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m42s)

[be a known](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m44s)

[type right so it U determining what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m46s)

[you're going to go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m49s)

[after I I think I got that right let me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m51s)

[know if I if I missed the mark on that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m54s)

[one is he I'm not I'm not sure I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m55s)

[fully fully grock the question I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h01m58s)

[I'm close but let me know if I'm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m00s)

[not um okay so the other thing that this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m03s)

[enables you to do is you can plug in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m07s)

[your own resolvers so for example if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m09s)

[you've got some bit of uh some objects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m12s)

[and you want to use Auto mocker like a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m16s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m18s)

[to build those up um so uh let's imagine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m19s)

[that you are building a uh application](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m23s)

[with a DB context and you've got a bunch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m27s)

[of NAD types and you want to be able to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m30s)

[just spit back instances of those entity](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m32s)

[types you can build your own resolver](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m35s)

[that just always creates new instances](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m38s)

[let's let's imagine it's a to-do list](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m40s)

[right you build you know to-do list item](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m42s)

[resolver we can show this real quick](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m45s)

[interface name the fact that it's called](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m56s)

[mock resolver I don't like because it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h02m58s)

[does because most of our resolvers have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m00s)

[nothing to do with mocks but I resolver](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m02s)

[wasn't it was too generic so we had to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m04s)

[put something there and I'm I'm not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m07s)

[overly happy about it so the idea with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m08s)

[building your own resolver is quite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m11s)

[simple the context property will be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m13s)

[feeding you in and this is going to this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m16s)

[is going to matter the requested type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m19s)

[okay so for example if somebody does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m22s)

[mocker doget of I web service you are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m24s)

[going to be getting the generic of t for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m29s)

[the type right if uh you will if a if a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m32s)

[type being instantiated has a dependency](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m39s)

[the type you will see is web service or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m42s)

[my DB context it does mean that on here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m44s)

[you may have to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m47s)

[something like is subass of or is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m49s)

[assignable from or is assignable to or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m52s)

[similar right so just be aware of that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m54s)

[if you're doing this like this gets down](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m57s)

[to the system type reflection apis so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h03m59s)

[depending on what usually just matching](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m02s)

[straight up is fine depending on what it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m05s)

[is but be aware you might have to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m07s)

[that if your resolver calls context.](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m09s)

[value and you know set something right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m13s)

[this this will be the value that goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m18s)

[out calling the setter on the value](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m20s)

[property see if it'll show](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m24s)

[it there we go you will note sets the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m29s)

[value provided flag to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m33s)

[True once the value provided flag goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m35s)

[to true it stops walking through the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m37s)

[list of resolvers and that's the value](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m40s)

[that comes back this was a kind of a big](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m42s)

[point of contention um in the library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m44s)

[when we were doing notable reference](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m47s)

[types because we really like you'll note](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m48s)

[this get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m52s)

[method is declared](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m54s)

[non-nullable how and it will give you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h04m57s)

[back a non-null instance with the only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m00s)

[exception being if someone creates a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m03s)

[resolver like this and shoves it in you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m06s)

[can get a null instance back if a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m09s)

[resolver forces a null](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m11s)

[through and that that was a part that we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m15s)

[that we we really struggled with is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m18s)

[trying to figure out do we declare this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m20s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m23s)

[nullable when in nearly every case it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m23s)

[going to be non-null and the only time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m27s)

[it's going to be null is if somebody](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m29s)

[does something really really bad because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m32s)

[in general if you're creating your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m35s)

[resolver you probably aren't plugging in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m36s)

[a null if you write a custom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m39s)

[resolver you're probably plugging in an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m42s)

[instance and all the built-in resolvers](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m47s)

[return nonn so it was one of those is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m49s)

[like if we make it return nullable which](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m51s)

[is technically correct it means people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m53s)

[have to do null checks all over the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m56s)

[place when it's basically never null and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h05m58s)

[then the guidance becomes always you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m02s)

[know put a bang on the end of this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m04s)

[unless you've done something horrible](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m05s)

[with your resolvers so things like that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m07s)

[so just be aware you're usually going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m10s)

[get back non-null instances except if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m13s)

[somebody plugs in a resolver so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m16s)

[but all the built-in resolvers are going](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m19s)

[to give you non-null](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m21s)

[instances so just be aware of that if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m23s)

[you want to do any amount of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m25s)

[customization of how items are created](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m26s)

[and you want to call back Behavior right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m30s)

[the key thing is call back Behavior](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m32s)

[rather than just uh inserting instances](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m34s)

[if you just want to insert an instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m38s)

[mocker do use and you're done right the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m40s)

[other common thing that that comes up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m43s)

[right is like if we take](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m46s)

[our our fake DB context right so we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m49s)

[mocker use something that that does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m52s)

[occur quite a bit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m55s)

[is uh my DB context so create the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h06m58s)

[return value from create instance is not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m02s)

[cached in that dictionary so the return](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m05s)

[value from create instance however all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m08s)

[of that thing's dependencies and any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m11s)

[recursive dependencies](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m13s)

[are okay so create instance is the only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m15s)

[one that doesn't if you call get instead](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m18s)

[of create instance get will possibly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m22s)

[create something for you depending on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m25s)

[what the type is um and it will be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m26s)

[cached depending on which which way you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m29s)

[want to go but this pattern here and I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m31s)

[keep meaning to write an analyzer for it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m33s)

[haven't gotten around for it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m36s)

[this um was somewhat common to want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m39s)

[do because quite often especially if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m42s)

[you've built up some stuff with your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m44s)

[auto marer call and create instance and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m46s)

[saying yeah this is the instance I want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m48s)

[to use you can either do this by](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m49s)

[plugging in your own resolver um or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m51s)

[there's a nice little handy helper](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m54s)

[method here there is mocker dowith and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h07m56s)

[this is a fairly recent one but you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m00s)

[just do mocker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m03s)

[width and mocker width is just shorthand](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m05s)

[for use passing in a create](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m10s)

[instance sounds like another stream](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m13s)

[analyzers are interesting and tricky yes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m15s)

[they are yes they are but this is the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m17s)

[pattern here right if you call mocker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m19s)

[use and the parameter that you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m22s)

[feeding into use is a create instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m24s)

[call that is literally all the mocker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m26s)

[width method does right it's literally](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m28s)

[call and use with create instance that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m31s)

[it it's syntactic sugar over used with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m33s)

[create instance next version of autom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m36s)

[marker these aren't going to be void](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m38s)

[returning either they're going to give](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m39s)

[you back the create instance uh result](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m41s)

[as well just because this pattern I had](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m43s)

[to type it too much one day](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m46s)

[um and then that night there may have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m49s)

[been a PR with a with keyword added to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m51s)

[the library because darn it I was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m53s)

[getting tired of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h08m55s)

[typing um at some point would you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m00s)

[mocking extension method with log air](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m03s)

[and I logger oh oh you're jumping ahead](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m04s)

[in the hold on hold Benjamin give me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m08s)

[five minutes we're getting there we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m10s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m12s)

[there that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m13s)

[coming uh well let me put it this way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m16s)

[it's not possible and it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m19s)

[forthcoming so I'll I'll I'll I'll let](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m22s)

[the yeah so these are equal okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m25s)

[happiness there the resolvers call back](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m31s)

[there those are two things that I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m33s)

[are mildly convenient and nice one other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m35s)

[thing that I think is nice and something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m38s)

[that I've started to lean into more on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m41s)

[this Library so you will note here I put](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m43s)

[in null checks because it is nice to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m46s)

[able to do null checks on your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m49s)

[parameters the problem is is the code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m51s)

[like this if you run um code coverage](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m54s)

[reports which a lot of people do most of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h09m58s)

[the time unless you write a test to pass](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m01s)

[in the null for each of these you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m03s)

[going to see that 50% of these lines](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m05s)

[aren't covered because functionally this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m08s)

[double question mark is an if statement](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m10s)

[says okay if this is null then throw](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m12s)

[argument null exception if this is null](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m15s)

[then throw argum](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m17s)

[no exception and unless you hit both](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m18s)

[sides of that if um the code coverage](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m20s)

[will say you know what you only hit 50%](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m23s)

[of your Constructor it's like dang it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m25s)

[the problem is writing those tests are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m28s)

[very low value right very low value and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m30s)

[I I struggled with this because I'm like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m36s)

[I I could get some people just don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m38s)

[write the null checks because they're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m40s)

[like I don't want to hurt our code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m41s)

[coverage and I'm not interested in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m43s)

[writing a whole bunch of worthless tests](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m45s)

[and they aren't completely worthless but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m47s)

[they're pretty worthless like it usually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m49s)

[like having or not having this argument](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m52s)

[no exception usually doesn't cause a bug](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m55s)

[sometimes it does because it blows up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h10m58s)

[with a no ref later that you could have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m00s)

[caught](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m01s)

[earlier um and more often than not I see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m02s)

[people get the name of parameter](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m05s)

[wrong and it doesn't actually show the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m07s)

[the appropriate parameter name which is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m10s)

[annoying right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m12s)

[so something in the autom marer library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m15s)

[if we go ahead and make this guy partial](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m18s)

[this should hearken back to last week's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m20s)

[stream on Source generators and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m21s)

[Community toolkit uh autom marer comes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m23s)

[with a source generator soon to come](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m26s)

[with more Source generators uh so if we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m28s)

[do Constructor tests and we feed it the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m30s)

[the thing that we want to do the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m34s)

[model what this guy is going to do and I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m41s)

[and it is going to write up a bunch of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h11m55s)

[every single one of my Constructor](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m00s)

[and it is uh it is going to pass null in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m05s)

[for each of those parameters so I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m09s)

[realize this kind of ugly and hard to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m11s)

[read um but the the key line is uh right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m13s)

[here right this is this is the key thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m18s)

[is it is asserting that it throws an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m21s)

[argument null](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m24s)

[will be null and it's passing in an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m33s)

[is the source of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m42s)

[passed in so the second parameter and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m48s)

[then it does an assertion to make sure](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m50s)

[that one when I pass a null from my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m51s)

[parameter name name match my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h12m59s)

[expectation right this was my compromise](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m01s)

[so now I can have my null checks without](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m05s)

[my code coverage suffering and more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m07s)

[importantly I didn't have to write the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m09s)

[worthless](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m11s)

[worthless very low value low impact test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m14s)

[so if you want to spam your unit test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m19s)

[numbers and make it look like you've](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m21s)

[done a lot more than you actually have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m22s)

[Source generator your unit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m24s)

[test that that's a thing right so this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m26s)

[will go through and and do it it does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m30s)

[have a small bit of magic as long as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m32s)

[either Ms test nunit or xunit it will](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m36s)

[generate up methods and assert](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m40s)

[cannot find one of the big three known](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m47s)

[um uh uh unit test uh projects being](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m51s)

[referenced it will still genen these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m56s)

[methods but it will be up to you to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h13m58s)

[Place uh opening up a PR tonight on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m04s)

[every project to test my C yeah so again](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m07s)

[this this is my compromise of dealing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m12s)

[with uh it at some point point I may I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m15s)

[may add a generic overload to this so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m19s)

[that because now that we have uh generic](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m21s)

[attributes um the only disadvantage is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m24s)

[auto mocker is backwards compatible so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m26s)

[this would have to be like an ifdef](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m28s)

[situation right because we can get away](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m31s)

[what what is the Syntax for it that oh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m33s)

[it's it's unhappy because there isn't a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m37s)

[generic version of Constructor test yes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m39s)

[of course there's not it doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m40s)

[yet but at some point I may I may slap a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m42s)

[generic one in just so that I can type](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m45s)

[uh the little alligator braces rather](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m47s)

[than type of and save myself um a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m49s)

[bit of typing so that is one of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m51s)

[other things that I Love About Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m53s)

[marker is it will gen those tests for me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m55s)

[and it kind of gives a template of where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m58s)

[things are going okay so cool stuff](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h14m59s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m02s)

[forthcoming I have everybody's favorite](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m03s)

[get Kraken and I've got PRS](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m06s)

[open I've got PRS open um so that one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m10s)

[doesn't count we looked at logo eye](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m14s)

[options](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m17s)

[okay so a common pattern that that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m18s)

[really like doing with auto marer is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m21s)

[building out extension methods for auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m25s)

[marker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m27s)

[because um Auto marker is very easy to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m29s)

[just shove stuff into it's very easy to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m32s)

[write extension methods that maybe](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m35s)

[populate with with some known types](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m36s)

[right so you can imagine if you've got a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m40s)

[set of uh services that you're going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m42s)

[use repeatedly in a bunch of different](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m45s)

[test like I was saying before you could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m47s)

[write a a common setup method that sets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m49s)

[things up but often times what I find](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m52s)

[that I like better is writing an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m54s)

[extension method targeting Auto marer](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m56s)

[and just doing a bunch of Ed statements](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h15m59s)

[or similar to to build up the right set](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m01s)

[of things into that dictionary and that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m04s)

[oftentimes ends up being the the setup](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m06s)

[for my test is these extension methods](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m09s)

[that then I can compose together because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m12s)

[often times I'll I'll have them also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m14s)

[return the auto marer instant so I can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m15s)

[do a very fluent like syntax and just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m17s)

[ding ding ding ding ding ding right and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m20s)

[build those things up one of the common](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m22s)

[things that comes up a lot is Benjamin's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m24s)

[comment earlier about things like ey](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m27s)

[logger eye options things that are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m29s)

[somewhat common to use in a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m32s)

[different projects the problem is is the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m34s)

[auto marker library is not going to take](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m37s)

[a dependency on those other libraries](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m40s)

[because Auto markers intended the only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m43s)

[dependency that it actually wants to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m44s)

[take is mock and that's it like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m47s)

[obviously Auto marer has to take a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m50s)

[dependency on mock that's kind of a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m51s)

[given um though we could potentially](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m52s)

[even ask that now that I think about it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m55s)

[regardless um but it is very common to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h16m58s)

[have some set of extension methods on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m02s)

[auto marer for potentially like doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m05s)

[logging validation or similar right um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m08s)

[and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m12s)

[so the the idea that that I am](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m13s)

[experimenting with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m16s)

[I'm just jump over here reload okay here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m18s)

[here's the idea that I'm experimenting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m21s)

[with and then this is an open PR so here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m24s)

[is a test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m29s)

[project and this test project references](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m32s)

[the the Microsoft extensions options](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m35s)

[library right so we've got this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m38s)

[controller with options thing it takes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m41s)

[in and eye options that's it not a real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m43s)

[exciting thing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m45s)

[um and we can see in here this guy has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m48s)

[an auto marer instance he's calling this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m52s)

[magical new extension method called with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m55s)

[options and with options comes with a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h17m57s)

[little call back uh delegate that lets](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m00s)

[you it it's optional but it lets you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m04s)

[assign some values into the options](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m06s)

[class so this should look very similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m07s)

[to people who are used to dealing with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m10s)

[eye options uh in their setup with their](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m11s)

[eye](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m14s)

[configuration right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m15s)

[but you'll remember before what I was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m18s)

[showing you is auto marer doesn't take a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m20s)

[dependency on eye options right if we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m23s)

[look over](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m25s)

[here there is no](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m27s)

[dependency at all on on eye options in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m30s)

[fact I thought I killed this one off](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m33s)

[too I lied apparently we have a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m36s)

[dependency on non-blocking I should](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m38s)

[potentially look and see why if we can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m41s)

[kill that um but there is no eye options](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m42s)

[project reference or or nougat package](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m48s)

[at all so the question is where does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m50s)

[this guy come from so if we come over](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m51s)

[here and we expand this guy out and we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m54s)

[look at our](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m57s)

[analyzers uh automach](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h18m59s)

[generators you'll note there's this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m02s)

[options gener options extension Source](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m04s)

[generator and the idea](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m07s)

[here is it is uh a source generator is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m10s)

[going to create an extension method on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m14s)

[the auto marer instance again this is an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m16s)

[open PR nothing's merged so feedback](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m18s)

[welcome um but it goes through and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m22s)

[registers up a bunch of the uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m24s)

[interfaces around eye options that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m28s)

[people might be using right the common](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m30s)

[one is eye options of T and people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m33s)

[forget that there's like other things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m35s)

[you can do with it like eye options](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m37s)

[monitor eye options snapshot all of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m40s)

[these kind of more advanced use cases](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m42s)

[that all exist uh and don't get they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m44s)

[they don't get as much credit as they](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m47s)

[probably deserve because there's some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m48s)

[cool stuff if you're not familiar with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m49s)

[what all these things do go Google it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m51s)

[there there's some cool stuff with eye](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m53s)

[options um for knowing you know how to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m54s)

[refresh and pull stuff and grab it and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m57s)

[all that kind of stuff so cool stuff so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h19m59s)

[but this extension method now adds it in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m02s)

[and the idea here is this EXT or this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m05s)

[Source generator only](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m07s)

[runs on projects that reference eye](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m10s)

[options and here's the cool part](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m14s)

[you will note this project that it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m17s)

[generated into doesn't reference eye](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m20s)

[options but it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m24s)

[references uh the um uh this project](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m27s)

[here the generator's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m32s)

[example this guy here there's a project](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m34s)

[reference to the example and this guy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m37s)

[reference or similar um it will go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h20m57s)

[through the source generator will go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m01s)

[through and it will gen this out now my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m02s)

[intent is to do similar things for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m05s)

[logging logging gets a little more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m08s)

[interesting though right because logging](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m11s)

[specifically the ey logger interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m15s)

[has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m18s)

[um has a lot of uh cases](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m20s)

[where it will the the common use case](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m24s)

[for it is extension methods right log](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m28s)

[air log warning log information Etc the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m31s)

[but all of those extension methods kind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m35s)

[of boil down into a single log method on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m36s)

[ilogger but you don't really want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m40s)

[write your setups and your verifies and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m42s)

[all of that stuff against that that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m45s)

[it's kind](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m47s)

[of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m49s)

[so the end goal is going to be to have a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m51s)

[similar Source generator gen out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m55s)

[relevant stuff for ilogger preferably](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h21m58s)

[with a nice um API now the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m01s)

[thing second let me](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m06s)

[grab there is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m09s)

[a the project that does not get](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m12s)

[enough this guy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m15s)

[yeah let's see thread sleep should not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m19s)

[be used in test yes in general thread](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m21s)

[sleep should probably not be used at all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m23s)

[anymore um task delay is much preferred](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m26s)

[if you need to slow something down for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m30s)

[some reason thread sleep literally puts](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m31s)

[the thread to sleep and that's rarely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m33s)

[what you're after uh let's see the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m35s)

[existing way for I found to do this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m37s)

[like but it's super ugly and I'm sure uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m39s)

[twitch won't help me with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m41s)

[formatting oh yeah yeah so that sort of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m43s)

[setup on ilogger is exactly the type of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m46s)

[stuff that I don't want to write because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m50s)

[most people don't want to deal with all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m53s)

[of that extra parameter matching that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m55s)

[not what they care about they want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h22m57s)

[write they want to write code that looks](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m00s)

[like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m02s)

[this right this is the code that people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m03s)

[want to write for your assertions right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m06s)

[I want to verify that log information](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m10s)

[was called and it looks like this right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m12s)

[this is what what we want and so this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m16s)

[is um this is a bit of inspiration that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m20s)

[I'm taking this from if you're already](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m23s)

[using mock feel free to plug this in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m25s)

[this Library works great um it adds](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m27s)

[extension methods on top of mock um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m30s)

[specifically to go through and do verify](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m34s)

[ey logger stuff where then you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m37s)

[verify you know log information Etc](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m40s)

[right because I've written s similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m44s)

[things to what you have there Benjamin](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m45s)

[of doing all of that stuff but yuck it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m47s)

[and I I I've got](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m51s)

[a um I I've got a various things where I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m52s)

[broke it down to where you can](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m58s)

[optionally pass in the expressions for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h23m59s)

[each of those so you don't have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m02s)

[specify them every time but it's still](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m03s)

[not great um but I think some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m05s)

[combination of that plus some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m07s)

[combination of something similar to this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m09s)

[is kind of what I want to see for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m11s)

[reference the way this guy is doing it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m13s)

[is you'll note this is not the same](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m16s)

[verify method so he's not hooking the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m18s)

[same](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m21s)

[endpoint um they what what he's doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m23s)

[instead is this is taking in an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m27s)

[expression and he's parsing this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m29s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m31s)

[himself it's it's pretty like feel free](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m32s)

[to check out his code it's pretty slick](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m35s)

[um and in order for that to work it has](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m37s)

[to Target these](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m41s)

[methods somewhat reflection like in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m42s)

[order to do it because there there's 's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m45s)

[not a great way to go after this and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m47s)

[it's it's unlikely to cause a problem](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m49s)

[because how many people are going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m51s)

[write their own log information](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m52s)

[extension method that doesn't call the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m54s)

[regular method for logging information](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m57s)

[it's kind of weird so uh but this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h24m59s)

[kind of a very clever library and if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m04s)

[want to use this with Mock and auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m06s)

[marker you can pull this in like there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m08s)

[nothing stopping you from doing this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m09s)

[this Library just brings a bunch of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m11s)

[extension methods on mock of T that then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m13s)

[you are off to the RAC to go and uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m15s)

[leverage see do all Source generators](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m18s)

[add the exclude from code coverage uh I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m21s)

[believe the answer is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m25s)

[yes yes is that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m29s)

[um I I so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m34s)

[typically uh what will happen and th](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m36s)

[this is somewhat convention like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m39s)

[is um code coverage tool tools](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m43s)

[previously have uh from their Inception](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m47s)

[have often used Convention as a way of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m50s)

[detecting generated code even before](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m54s)

[Source generators exist um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h25m56s)

[and and we'll we'll ignore generated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m01s)

[code one of the common conventions was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m04s)

[uhg docs and I'm realizing on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m07s)

[my on my options one it is not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m11s)

[generating with a dog. CS so I might](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m13s)

[have to just go fix that real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m16s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m18s)

[um because it is it is technically](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m19s)

[possible for generated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m23s)

[code to make it into code coverage but](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m25s)

[because of the way most code coverage](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m29s)

[things try to actively exclude generated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m31s)

[stuff by default uh it typically doesn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m34s)

[show up I say typically um but it it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m37s)

[it's not uncommon for um generated code](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m41s)

[to put stuff uh cuz there's comments](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m44s)

[that you can put at the beginning to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m47s)

[indicate that you're generated there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m48s)

[attributes you can decorate to indicate](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m50s)

[that you're generated and then there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m52s)

[the file name I think those are the big](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m53s)

[conventions I'm aware of there could be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m55s)

[more uh let's see should Fields be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h26m59s)

[private](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m01s)

[uh yes I will I I'm hedging slightly um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m04s)

[the the only time where I potentially](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m10s)

[expose Fields is if they are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m13s)

[uh static and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m17s)

[readon so for example like it's there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m18s)

[not a big issue with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m21s)

[making uh like constants public for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m23s)

[example the uh because they can't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m26s)

[functionally be changed and I found that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m29s)

[there are times where I want to expose](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m31s)

[something that's basically a constant](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m34s)

[like if I've generated](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m36s)

[a um a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m38s)

[guid and want it to be accessible in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m42s)

[multiple places um so public static](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m45s)

[readon field here um in those cases I I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m49s)

[would say not private is fine because it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m54s)

[is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m57s)

[functionally uh readon and and designed](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h27m58s)

[to function in the same way as a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m01s)

[constant](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m04s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m07s)

[so uh yes but in general Fields should](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m09s)

[yes in general Fields should definitely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m14s)

[be PR](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m16s)

[typically only accessed via um a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m17s)

[property and most of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m20s)

[time uh the presence of fields have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m22s)

[somewhat gone down with the addition of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m25s)

[Auto properties because Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m28s)

[properties give you the benefits of a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m31s)

[property and a field and it's less](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m33s)

[typing so oftentimes I don't create as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m35s)

[many fields because I'll I'll usually](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m39s)

[just spin an auto property instead and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m41s)

[then it's kind of a mute point say it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m44s)

[the same way I get around a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m46s)

[people's naming conventions because](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m47s)

[people bicker about the naming](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m49s)

[conventions for Fields um I just make an](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m50s)

[auto property instead and then and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m53s)

[the problem goes away and the only time](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m55s)

[you absolutely need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h28m58s)

[a a field is in the case](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m00s)

[of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m04s)

[um if you're going to end up needing to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m06s)

[re uh use it as like a ref or an out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m08s)

[later but in those cases it definitely](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m11s)

[should be private because if you're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m14s)

[using it is like an out or ref um at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m16s)

[that point you're indicating that it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m19s)

[writable and so it definitely shouldn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m20s)

[be public uh pushing this code somewhere](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m22s)

[uh when you are done tonight](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m25s)

[oo don't mind but I want to try](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m30s)

[something I want to try](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m34s)

[something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m37s)

[um I'm trying to decide where I would](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m42s)

[push](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m44s)

[it where would I push it because I I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m45s)

[would was going to I was going to play](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m49s)

[around with the the get cracken patch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m51s)

[stuff kind of a kind of a cool use case](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m53s)

[for it um I don't know how well it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m56s)

[going to work either I I got my I I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h29m59s)

[figured out some of my get Kraken patch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m01s)

[issues so for people who caught my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m04s)

[stream a while back on that um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m05s)

[apparently I had botched my install](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m08s)

[somehow because a reinstall and the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m10s)

[problem just magically vanished so I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m13s)

[went oh okay okay so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m15s)

[something does that work if you don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m18s)

[have a base repo well that's what we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m19s)

[going to find out that is what we are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m21s)

[going to find out because I honestly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m24s)

[don't know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m27s)

[um yeah so let's let's try this real](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m30s)

[quick so let's see uh CD de CD Dev](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m34s)

[temp uh CD I think it was testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m40s)

[example there we go uh get in knit I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m43s)

[think I have to make this like this and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m47s)

[then I from](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m51s)

[here uh let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m54s)

[see I think I can just do this can I uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h30m57s)

[what is it oh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m00s)

[gkc uh is it I think it's graph](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m03s)

[show uh oh yeah screw it just GNA do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m11s)

[this open repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m16s)

[Dev](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m18s)

[um because I don't actually know what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m20s)

[this is going to do so we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m22s)

[gonna find out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m25s)

[together I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m26s)

[think uh let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m30s)

[see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m32s)

[yeah uh let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m36s)

[see uh do you use omm](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m38s)

[the uh let's see the uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m42s)

[uh Entity framework most of the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m47s)

[time specifically for for database](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m51s)

[access most of the so Entity framework](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m54s)

[typically with Azure SQL Andor SQL](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h31m57s)

[light okay so if I click this button](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m02s)

[because the base commit is is empty with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m06s)

[just a a read me there right so this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m10s)

[all new stuff if I click this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m13s)

[see anyone with the link oh I got to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m23s)

[give it a title um testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m27s)

[example this is a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m31s)

[test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m35s)

[uh great](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m37s)

[patch copy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m41s)

[link uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m44s)

[so I don't actually know what that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m47s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m50s)

[do we're going to try this and and we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m53s)

[going to see what the heck that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m56s)

[does uh open existing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h32m59s)

[repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m03s)

[ah clone from repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m04s)

[URL oh so it is going to need a base](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m07s)

[repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m10s)

[somewhere I'm now real tempted to leave](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m11s)

[myself an empty repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m14s)

[oh interesting so it's going to want a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m19s)

[repo I'd love if I could do it without a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m24s)

[repo add that to my list add that to my](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m28s)

[list there's going to be a video](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m31s)

[forthcoming on some of this Cloud patch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m33s)

[stuff by the way so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m35s)

[um it doesn't look like it works yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m38s)

[because it wants it wants to open and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m41s)

[it's going to try to apply it and it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m43s)

[wants to match on the repo and it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m45s)

[doesn't have something to match on so I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m47s)

[imagine it's impossible for you to feed](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m50s)

[it an empty repo](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m55s)

[URL well that's disappointing yes um I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h33m57s)

[can push](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m01s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m02s)

[somewhere stage testing uh example](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m04s)

[code so we're going to do that we're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m10s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m12s)

[that commit push uh uh yeah](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m13s)

[sure let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m19s)

[see so we're going to go there testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m22s)

[example uh code samples from stream on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m27s)

[see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m33s)

[17 2024 that way I can remember](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m34s)

[it I think there's a setting for that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m45s)

[I don't know that get Kraken](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m49s)

[um yeah default Branch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m54s)

[name so if yours is falling back to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h34m57s)

[master that could be either in your own](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m01s)

[local git](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m05s)

[config I because I I think it defaults](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m06s)

[to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m09s)

[main on a clean](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m11s)

[machine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m15s)

[yeah but the only reason mine defaulted](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m18s)

[to master is I did I did get a knit on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m20s)

[the command line I didn't do it in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m24s)

[Kraken right because I I did um this guy](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m26s)

[here so at that point it's no longer um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m31s)

[git Kraken that's doing it it is um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m35s)

[local git config that's that's setting](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m39s)

[it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m41s)

[up so there is that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m43s)

[um it claimed repo failed but I now see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m47s)

[dependabot remote so I'm going to go out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m50s)

[on limb and go with yeah repo's there uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m52s)

[let's see for anyone who wants the link](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m55s)

[I'm going to put it there and then I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h35m59s)

[will probably just immediately archive](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m01s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m03s)

[project because I don't intend to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m04s)

[uh one because uh I don't want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m11s)

[maintain this project and I don't want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m14s)

[dependabot spamming](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m16s)

[me and so it will be in an archived](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m18s)

[state for for what it is worth um that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m23s)

[way it uh doesn't go anywhere but yes so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m27s)

[so longterm uh one of the plans for auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m30s)

[marer is to implement some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m33s)

[variant](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m37s)

[um some variant of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m40s)

[these uh so that you can have mocker do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m43s)

[verify log right or or similar um there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m47s)

[there there's kind of an outstanding](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m53s)

[question do we do we just pull in this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m54s)

[Library I mean it has been touched in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h36m57s)

[three years but the ey loger interface](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m00s)

[hasn't changed in like that amount of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m02s)

[time so it not like it really needs it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m04s)

[um or do we go through and do some sort](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m07s)

[of expression parsing ourself or similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m09s)

[blah blah blah blah blah so there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m12s)

[there's a lot of questions on what is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m13s)

[the appropriate thing to do here and how](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m16s)

[to how to properly handle it ilogger is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m19s)

[a little more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m22s)

[complex](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m24s)

[than I would like it to be right the the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m25s)

[other drawback is sometimes people don't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m29s)

[take in uh an i logger as their](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m31s)

[dependency they take in um I logger](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m34s)

[Factory and gen the logger themselves so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m37s)

[uh for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m41s)

[example if I go here pull this back](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m44s)

[there is an outstanding issue over](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m49s)

[here](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m53s)

[um and you'll note here the uh this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m55s)

[issue Adam actually drops in a sample of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h37m58s)

[his Mock resolver and this is a mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m02s)

[resolver that you can put in your](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m05s)

[project because your project is probably](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m07s)

[referencing ilogger it is much more](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m10s)

[difficult for us to put it into](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m13s)

[Auto mocker proper because it would](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m16s)

[require us to take a dependency on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m19s)

[ilogger and we don't necessarily want to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m20s)

[do that so something like this if you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m22s)

[are wanting to do so certainly works](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m26s)

[right you'll you'll not it does some fun](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m30s)

[recursiveness um with it generics to be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m32s)

[able to build up the the logger and then](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m35s)

[something something like this and there](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m40s)

[is a chance that something like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m44s)

[gets tacked on and especially now that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m46s)

[we're starting in on the source](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m47s)

[generator approach it is certainly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m49s)

[something um that could potentially make](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m52s)

[its](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m55s)

[way make its way in right we could](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m56s)

[Source](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h38m59s)

[generator something that's an extension](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m00s)

[method on uh loggers mock there's also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m03s)

[talk about being able to Source](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m06s)

[generator in um default mock resolvers](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m07s)

[because right now the the mock resolvers](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m12s)

[are just straight](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m15s)

[injected uh you you like if for](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m17s)

[reference if anybody wants to contribute](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m20s)

[to this Library feel free this is a very](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m22s)

[clean library in my opinion it's fairly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m24s)

[well structured there's lots of test](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m27s)

[coverage so it's it's pretty hard to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m30s)

[accidentally break things yeah right now](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m32s)

[the the resolvers are just straight up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m36s)

[new list right which is fine it's fine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m39s)

[it's not great it's fine](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m44s)

[but um I I have thoughts on being able](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m46s)

[to uh have a a default collection that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m51s)

[could be added to or similar by like a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m55s)

[source generator to be able to inject](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h39m57s)

[more and then a lot of these in theory](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m00s)

[could be](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m03s)

[um uh Singleton instances to avoid any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m05s)

[extra allocations or lazily loaded and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m08s)

[that kind of thing so there's there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m10s)

[extra stuff that could go along with](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m12s)

[this that is not there yet but um but it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m14s)

[is there and and works rather well and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m18s)

[it for the most part like at one point](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m20s)

[in time this entire project was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m23s)

[five one one yeah that's that's too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m27s)

[that's too much um but yeah and so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m32s)

[things like the the with keyword you'll](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m35s)

[note isn't a void return but this is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m37s)

[latest uh Branch not latest release and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m40s)

[there's kind of there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m42s)

[features that were we we're trying to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m44s)

[pop in before the next release goes out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m46s)

[but we're kind of due for one kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m48s)

[due for one like you can see the uh we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m50s)

[don't release often like last release](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m55s)

[was January of 2023 so we're at we're at](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h40m57s)

[a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m01s)

[year and and the one before that was six](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m01s)

[months it it's because there's not a lot](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m06s)

[that needs to get added or is highly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m08s)

[critical or whatnot like there haven't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m11s)

[really been bugs around the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m14s)

[library so but we picked up enough news](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m17s)

[we got a another one and a half million](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m23s)

[downloads so you know it's time it's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m26s)

[time to kick a release make it a little](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m27s)

[cooler and go through and do it and like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m28s)

[I said there's there's plenty of other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m30s)

[libraries um I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m31s)

[Auto is it there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m35s)

[another there's another Factory Library](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m38s)

[whose name I'm blanking on that that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m41s)

[adds similar type automatic mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m43s)

[functionality for mock um that a lot of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m45s)

[people like using um and some people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m48s)

[like it over Auto marker because it also](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m50s)

[has um built-in support for things like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m53s)

[um kind of like Faker support where](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m57s)

[it'll gen instance of of fake objects](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h41m59s)

[with prean data which is great there's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m02s)

[nothing stopping people from plugging](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m05s)

[the libraries together too and mixing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m07s)

[and matching so we've tried to leave](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m08s)

[Auto marer open enough to where people](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m10s)

[can extend it uh in whatever uh way that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m13s)

[they need](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m17s)

[so okay there's Auto marcker did I miss](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m19s)

[any features of Auto marker that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m22s)

[wanted to cover I think I think I hit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m24s)

[everything I think I hit](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m29s)

[everything oh there was one that I](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m31s)

[skipped that I didn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m33s)

[cover um there is one last feature that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m35s)

[is in here if you have this is going to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m38s)

[look](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m41s)

[weird](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m44s)

[if you have autom marer tracking](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m46s)

[disposable instances for you you can do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m51s)

[um or or something or something similar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m54s)

[to this right uh if you do as disposable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h42m56s)

[this will return back a disposable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m00s)

[instance for you that when it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m02s)

[disposed it will rip through all of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m04s)

[those instances that autom marer knows](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m07s)

[about and call dispose on them that's it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m09s)

[it's no it's no more fancy than that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m13s)

[it's just a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m14s)

[because often times if you're using like](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m16s)

[dowi do use Etc you may inject a bunch](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m18s)

[of things that are idisposable that you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m21s)

[want cleaned up right](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m24s)

[um and all auto marer does is give you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m27s)

[this um disposable bit to go through and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m30s)

[do um this was another big point of API](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m34s)

[discussion of whether Auto the auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m37s)

[marer itself should be should Implement](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m41s)

[ey disposable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m44s)

[or whether you should have to make a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m46s)

[call to get back a disposable and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m48s)

[ultimately we decided on um making a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m51s)

[call to get back uh an i disposable was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m54s)

[a more intuitive approach for what was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h43m58s)

[occurring rather than just having Auto](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m01s)

[marer itself be idisposable the other](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m03s)

[drawback is if Auto marer itself was](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m06s)

[idisposable um analyzers that flag you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m08s)

[for not cleaning up disposable things](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m11s)

[would then start flagging code like this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m14s)

[which was less than ideal we didn't](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m17s)

[want it's sort of on the developer to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m19s)

[decide whether they need to clean up](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m23s)

[their disposable instances or](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m25s)

[not right especially in a testing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m26s)

[context it's not uncommon to have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m29s)

[something that's I disposable that](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m31s)

[doesn't really functionally have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m33s)

[anything to clean up because it's a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m35s)

[testing instance everything's in memory](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m37s)

[so um this is an option so that you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m40s)

[don't have to like manually track and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m44s)

[dispose all of your stuff you can just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m46s)

[do uh using VAR as disposable I use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m48s)

[underscore because just to indicate this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m52s)

[variable name literally doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m55s)

[I'm just I'm just setting a disposable](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m56s)

[scope that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h44m58s)

[it when I when this guy falls out of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m00s)

[scope clean up all the things and We're](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m02s)

[Off to the](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m05s)

[Races and they all get cleaned up and is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m06s)

[and is highly](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m10s)

[useful um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m12s)

[yeah okay let me just real quick before](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m16s)

[I get no stop it stop it stop it just do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m20s)

[a quick scan here to make sure I'm not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m24s)

[missing anything](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m26s)

[weird I think](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m29s)

[that's oh there is one other thing one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m31s)

[other I know I keep I keep I keep doing](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m34s)

[this I keep I need to I need to stop it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m40s)

[okay so on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m41s)

[our uh uh uh we don't have a good method](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m43s)

[here well let's imagine we](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m48s)

[had](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m51s)

[um void uh way too many bring Fu in bar](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h45m54s)

[double](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m03s)

[baz](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m08s)

[object don't care Etc right so let's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m10s)

[imagine we've got a thing that has way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m14s)

[too many parameters on it or is not way](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m16s)

[too many but you get the point um in](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m18s)

[order to do a a mock setup what you](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m22s)

[would what you would oftentimes do is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m26s)

[you'd go mock uh setup and then you do a](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m28s)

[i web service and then you'd have to do](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m37s)

[XX uh way too many and then you have to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m39s)

[tell it inside of the expression what](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m42s)

[the parameter values are that you want](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m44s)

[to match on and it's very common to not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m46s)

[necessarily always care or not be or not](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m49s)

[be able to know right so uh it is or it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m51s)

[is any is the common thing so it is any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m55s)

[int uh or I'm sorry it is any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h46m59s)

[string uh it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m04s)

[any uh](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m07s)

[in uh this is I'm already annoyed and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m10s)

[I've only typed two uh it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m13s)

[any](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m17s)

[double it is](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m21s)

[any object right so all this work all](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m24s)

[this typing to to build this out just so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m30s)

[that we could do a setup it's kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m32s)

[pain in the neck so the auto marer does](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m34s)

[offer you a convenience method marker](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m37s)

[setup uh setup with any you have to give](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m40s)

[it a generic because it needs to know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m43s)

[what type to act on and then you give it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m45s)

[a name of let's see](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m47s)

[I web service way too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m50s)

[many boom](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m54s)

[so this uses some](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h47m56s)

[reflectionyoutube to set up on this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m13s)

[method I don't care about the parameters](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m15s)

[just give me the setup we're moving on](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m17s)

[right so not overly common to need this](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m20s)

[because you do have to do like a name of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m23s)

[because it has to find the method by](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m25s)

[string obviously it doesn't play nice if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m27s)

[you have uh multiple overload overloads](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m29s)

[multiple overloads is something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m34s)

[different um because if you have](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m36s)

[multiple overloads it wouldn't know](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m39s)

[which overload you are intending which](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m41s)

[is why mock makes you specify those so](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m43s)

[that the compiler can disambiguate which](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m46s)

[one you're going for um in this case](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m48s)

[because it's all reflection base it goes](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m51s)

[just give me the string and as long as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m52s)

[it's not an overloaded method it'll go](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m55s)

[yeah I got you and it'll plug it in and](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m57s)

[and build up the setup for you so as](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h48m59s)

[long as that's all you care about um](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m02s)

[it'll work great two parameters if](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m06s)

[there's a return type and you're Off to](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m08s)

[the Races and then you can get something](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m10s)

[with a a very simple setup so again](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m12s)

[another one of those kind of just](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m15s)

[smoothing over features that I kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m17s)

[wish was possible to do in a different](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m20s)

[way because this kind of](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m22s)

[syntax is is way too much typing way too](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m25s)

[much](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m28s)

[typing so okay I think that's](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m30s)

[it yes I think I covered everything one](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m33s)

[last one less look set up with any use](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m37s)

[verify verify all with with self mock](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m40s)

[create any scope](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m43s)

[oh um I will call this out](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m45s)

[because because the autom marer instance](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m49s)

[implements I service provider if you are](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m52s)

[referencing like the Microsoft di](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m56s)

[libraries or anything that you leverages](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h49m58s)

[them that adds extension methods on it](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h50m00s)

[the extension methods aren't guaranteed](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h50m03s)

[to work right if you call create](https://youtu.be/vHfzqVrmC6A?t=02h50m05s)
