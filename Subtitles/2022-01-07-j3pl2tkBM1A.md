[hello everyone welcome back](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m03s)

[um tonight i figured i would uh kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m05s)

[continue on i got a lot of feedback from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m08s)

[people uh after the last stream that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m10s)

[sort of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m12s)

[more training content focused on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m14s)

[different concepts specifically around](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m16s)

[wpf maybe some more advanced c-sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m18s)

[related stuff would be beneficial uh so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m20s)

[i thought tonight i would start with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m23s)

[doing some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m25s)

[i guess app architecture and dependency](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m26s)

[injection related uh bits with wpf so i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m28s)

[figured i would take one of the existing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m31s)

[apps so if you go back to my previous](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m33s)

[few streams um i built a wpf app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m35s)

[called color cracking for tweaking the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m39s)

[themes of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m41s)

[your get cracking client which is great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m42s)

[and cool and awesome i love it um but i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m44s)

[figured i would convert that thing over](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m47s)

[to doing um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m49s)

[a better architecture style it was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m50s)

[definitely written in a quick and dirty](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m52s)

[go as fast as i can on stream style](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m54s)

[mentality but i figured it would be a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m57s)

[good example of a real a real looking](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h00m59s)

[application to actually start to convert](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m02s)

[over and look at the benefits of it so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m03s)

[pow wow here real quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m08s)

[boom okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m11s)

[that is not useful](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m13s)

[that's more useful and let's go bigger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m19s)

[for those people who want the repository](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m20s)

[we'll drop a link if you want to follow](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m24s)

[along if anybody's catching the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m27s)

[recording of this on youtube just be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m29s)

[aware i've probably already pushed these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m31s)

[changes so um you'll have to go back in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m33s)

[history if you want to start from the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m35s)

[the beginning part](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m37s)

[so let's pull this guy up and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m39s)

[why not have it open nope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m42s)

[you can see my preparation was minimal](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m45s)

[let's go let's go through and just take](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m49s)

[a quick look at this application and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m51s)

[look at sort of some of the problems](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m52s)

[that are that are built into it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m54s)

[because i very conveniently built in a a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h01m57s)

[lot of them hey justin bieber thanks uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m00s)

[good to have you back again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m03s)

[i was going on some of your suggestions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m05s)

[around doing more kind of architectural](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m07s)

[design of this so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m09s)

[hopefully something like this will be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m11s)

[be useful to people](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m14s)

[so okay so this app here is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m16s)

[i won't say uh overly complex as you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m19s)

[see most of the the files this is a very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m22s)

[flat structure well who needs namespaces](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m24s)

[put everything at the root right so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m27s)

[there's there's a bunch of stuff here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m29s)

[but the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m31s)

[the main window here is is the primary](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m33s)

[ui](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m36s)

[so we'll just fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m37s)

[come here come here yeah there you go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m41s)

[drag](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m44s)

[using a mouse is hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m47s)

[tell them about them later awesome i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m49s)

[seriously i i've been uh keeping your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m51s)

[your ideas on a list so please feel free](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m54s)

[to feel free to shoot him at me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m56s)

[so main window it's got a group box it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h02m58s)

[got a list there's some stuff in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m01s)

[this is great we can change colors do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m04s)

[that manage our manage our different](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m06s)

[color profiles everything's great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m08s)

[from uh from a code perspective the main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m11s)

[window in its code behind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m16s)

[all right sorry not in its code behind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m17s)

[do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m20s)

[collapse this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m22s)

[collapse this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m25s)

[where is your data context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m27s)

[collapse the resources so the the data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m30s)

[context for the main window is just set](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m32s)

[straight in the xaml so there's nothing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m34s)

[fancy about it just directly creates it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m36s)

[so this will just invoke the default](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m38s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m40s)

[um and everything goes so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m41s)

[comes in here default constructor you'll](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m44s)

[note that it's got a static property for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m46s)

[this i messenger which is one of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m48s)

[things we're going to clean up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m49s)

[builds up all the related bindable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m51s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m54s)

[a bunch of stuff in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m55s)

[and that's all well and good uh we get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m57s)

[down to where we actually create](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h03m59s)

[or was it down here somewhere](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m02s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m05s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m07s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m09s)

[new theme view model uh nope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m11s)

[color picker view model one of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m15s)

[view models in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m16s)

[okay i've already lost track of my own](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m19s)

[code this is how this is how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m21s)

[disorganized this is i can't even find](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m22s)

[my own stuff anymore](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m24s)

[um where was this messenger reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m26s)

[that's that was the other one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m28s)

[i'm sorry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m31s)

[in this theme object right more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m32s)

[specifically this is just a record class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m35s)

[um we end up having to reference that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m38s)

[messenger property directly and things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m40s)

[start to get very uh coupled and a mess](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m45s)

[with dependency injection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m46s)

[there are there are two kind of main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m48s)

[problems that it aims to solve](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m50s)

[one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m52s)

[this coupling problem because without](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m53s)

[things like dependency injection you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m55s)

[start to run into this situation where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h04m58s)

[things get linked together so what i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m00s)

[mean by that this theme color class is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m03s)

[tightly linked to this messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m05s)

[property in my main window view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m08s)

[and there's not a great way for me to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m09s)

[break that link this is just a static](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m11s)

[property statics tend to make things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m12s)

[tightly coupled together the other thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m14s)

[that people often forget about is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m17s)

[when you invoke a constructor that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m20s)

[actually a static call or or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m22s)

[the it's the coupling equivalent of a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m25s)

[static call so you when you new up a new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m28s)

[object or class what ends up happening](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m31s)

[is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m33s)

[that allocates the memory and then the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m34s)

[the constructor gets invoked for you as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m36s)

[a method but all you did was new type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m39s)

[name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m41s)

[which is great but the class that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m42s)

[newing up the other class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m44s)

[those two things are now tightly coupled](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m47s)

[if i say that hey okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m49s)

[i don't want to use this static property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m51s)

[more i'd really like this guy to take in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m53s)

[an eye messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m55s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h05m57s)

[that way i can get away with something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m00s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m01s)

[i now have to start walking my way up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m03s)

[the food chain so i have to go okay that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m05s)

[that's now going to cause a compile](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m07s)

[error where do where did that guy go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m09s)

[thinking compiling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m12s)

[preview compiling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m15s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m18s)

[so now i realize okay everywhere where i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m20s)

[instantiate this i have to make sure i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m22s)

[pass it in my messenger and this thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m24s)

[just kind of starts to propagate up this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m26s)

[is a fairly small app so it's only gonna](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m27s)

[nothing in here is gonna propagate more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m30s)

[than maybe a couple layers but it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m31s)

[still going to propagate you can imagine](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m34s)

[in a much larger application this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m35s)

[problem starts to get really problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m37s)

[the other thing that it um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m40s)

[that this coupling ends up doing because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m43s)

[things are so tightly linked it makes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m45s)

[testing the application really hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m47s)

[and by testing i don't mean starting up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m49s)

[the app and just clicky clicky all the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m52s)

[way through the things test to make sure](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m53s)

[it works that's we'll call that manual](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m54s)

[testing but automated tests tend to get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m56s)

[much more difficult when everything's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h06m59s)

[tightly coupled um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m00s)

[dependency injection helps resolve those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m03s)

[things and gives you i guess clearer](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m05s)

[lines where you can shear things off so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m08s)

[let's let's look at means of doing we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m11s)

[going to look at implementation first](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m13s)

[and then go back to theory oftentimes i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m15s)

[do theory first but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m16s)

[i'm feeling i'm feeling funny tonight so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m19s)

[we're gonna go backwards](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m21s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m23s)

[so uh web developers](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m24s)

[have had](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m27s)

[a um i've had it nice for quite a while](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m28s)

[so if we do um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m32s)

[generic host](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m36s)

[c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m38s)

[the docs page for this is actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m39s)

[rather nice](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m40s)

[uh the asp.net](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m43s)

[folks um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m45s)

[they kind of started down this path](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m47s)

[back in the early uh.net core days](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m50s)

[with this idea of building out a web](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m53s)

[host builder and then it became apparent](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m55s)

[that that sort of generalized pattern](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m57s)

[that what people were wanting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h07m59s)

[was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m01s)

[some sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m02s)

[hosting thingy that could give any app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m04s)

[dependency injection logging](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m06s)

[configuration some sort of um service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m08s)

[implementation handling shutdown all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m11s)

[those types of things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m14s)

[are pretty common across a lot of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m15s)

[different apps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m17s)

[they're they're fairly common across](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m18s)

[even wpf applications console](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m21s)

[applications all of that kind of stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m23s)

[goes hand in hand](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m25s)

[so what ended up happening is now we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m26s)

[have this generic host that we can use](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m28s)

[and oftentimes people forget about this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m30s)

[inside of wpf wpa](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m34s)

[wpf predates all of this it was not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m36s)

[built with this generic host of mind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m38s)

[because this did not exist there's been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m40s)

[a lot of frameworks that have come along](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m42s)

[prism's the first one that comes to mind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m44s)

[that attempt to work around the fact](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m46s)

[that wpf was built before a lot of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m48s)

[nicer patterns uh were really in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m50s)

[existence and to um give you that kind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m53s)

[of nicety behavior but you don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m55s)

[necessarily need to go down that route](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m57s)

[what i was going to do tonight is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h08m59s)

[actually show using sort of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m00s)

[in the box they're microsoft nuget](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m03s)

[packages uh we'll call them first party](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m05s)

[nuget packages um to go through and get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m08s)

[that sort of same setup in your wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m11s)

[application for people who have done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m14s)

[um or played around with maui at all i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m17s)

[know i've talked about it a bunch on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m19s)

[last couple streams um this is going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m20s)

[start to look a little familiar because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m23s)

[the way they've structured the the di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m25s)

[inside of maui to be able to create your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m28s)

[your views and your view models and all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m30s)

[that is going to look really close to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m32s)

[what we end up building here so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m34s)

[so we come in here um and for people who](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m37s)

[have done asp net core stuff these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m40s)

[couple lines should look remarkably](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m42s)

[similar this if you do file new project](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m44s)

[on the web stuff you'll get a program cs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m47s)

[that looks kind of almost identical to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m49s)

[this or pretty close uh it'll have some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m52s)

[asp.net bits in it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m54s)

[um but this is what we're going to start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m56s)

[with and the the first thing to note is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h09m58s)

[that this is going to require setting up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m00s)

[a main method which is the typical place](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m02s)

[to do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m03s)

[now inside of a wpf application we don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m04s)

[usually write main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m07s)

[right we we are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m11s)

[just used to letting the framework](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m12s)

[handle all of that for us and say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m14s)

[get us get us the main one you want so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m16s)

[we need to start with actually getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m18s)

[ourselves a main method rather than](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m20s)

[using the auto-generated one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m22s)

[because wpf will auto-generate a main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m24s)

[method for us which is great but that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m27s)

[not actually what we want here so i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m29s)

[gonna just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m31s)

[i'm gonna move some stuff around](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m32s)

[because i cheated at this and did did a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m34s)

[little prepping ahead of time because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m37s)

[i felt the i felt the urge to do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m41s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m43s)

[let's make sure i'm going to just revert](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m44s)

[my current changes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m48s)

[real quick so that we go back into a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m50s)

[boom a working state because i'd like to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m53s)

[be in a nice compiling state](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m55s)

[and then we'll break stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h10m57s)

[okay so let's take let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m03s)

[what we want to do so i typically when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m05s)

[i'm going to do this you can go and put](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m08s)

[it in a program cs if you want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m09s)

[but what we need to do is actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m12s)

[create a main method so just like you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m13s)

[would in any other app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m15s)

[public static void main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m17s)

[string](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m20s)

[args](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m21s)

[boom and actually we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m24s)

[gonna just blatantly steal](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m25s)

[all of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m29s)

[i guess i didn't need to write that if i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m31s)

[was gonna copy and paste it so we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m32s)

[just gonna we're just gonna take all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m33s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m35s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m38s)

[and then i guess we actually need the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m39s)

[nuget package for this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m44s)

[something something microsoft](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m46s)

[uh let's look at the docs i think that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m49s)

[those are probably the easiest place to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m51s)

[get it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m52s)

[uh microsoft extensions hosting that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m54s)

[the magical nougat package we want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h11m58s)

[let's go here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m00s)

[boom let's turn off preview for the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m03s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m05s)

[uh i would like to browse](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m06s)

[that one pretty please](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m10s)

[great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m13s)

[and while we're in here we're gonna grab](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m15s)

[the dependency injection one two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m17s)

[and then see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m20s)

[injection so it just and i will call out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m22s)

[you want the dependency injection ones](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m25s)

[not the abstractions library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m27s)

[so this is kind of the base classes this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m30s)

[is the one that adds uh the microsoft](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m32s)

[default implementation with the way that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m35s)

[we're going to set this up because this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m37s)

[dependency injection is built on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m39s)

[abstractions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m41s)

[if you do want to plug and play a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m43s)

[different](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m45s)

[dependency injection container there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m45s)

[lots of them out there artifact inject](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m47s)

[unity structure map etc um all the major](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m50s)

[di container um they all have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m54s)

[uh packages that will let you work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m57s)

[they'll they'll sometimes they'll call](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h12m59s)

[them asp.net core dependency injection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m01s)

[they're not actually usually tied to asp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m04s)

[net core they're usually tied to this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m06s)

[dependency](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m08s)

[injection abstractions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m10s)

[and they'll usually just give you a nice](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m12s)

[extension method that you can um fire up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m13s)

[and do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m16s)

[okay now that we got the nuget packages](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m17s)

[we should be able to get the using](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m19s)

[statements loaded up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m20s)

[okay and then the first thing we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m22s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m23s)

[we're not going to have a host server so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m25s)

[we're going to get rid of that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m26s)

[okay so we've got our main method and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m28s)

[let's go through and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m31s)

[we now need to change up where this goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m33s)

[so if we go into here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m35s)

[so just right click on the project go to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m37s)

[properties and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m41s)

[startup object so you'll note](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m42s)

[not set is typically where you want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m45s)

[go but you can define your own entry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m47s)

[point so in this case we are going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m49s)

[set it to here so once i've written the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m52s)

[method it's able to find it and it knows](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m54s)

[hey you've got a custom one in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m56s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m58s)

[now if i fire this up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h13m59s)

[this is going to fail](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m01s)

[uh because this is not actually what you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m03s)

[want your main method to look like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m05s)

[is fine for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m07s)

[the the generic host bits but this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m09s)

[less fine for actually getting a wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m12s)

[application to go so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m14s)

[let's actually look real quick um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m16s)

[i'm gonna go back here and turn this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m20s)

[off](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m23s)

[uh let's just go into the cs proj](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m25s)

[so i can comment this out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m27s)

[and let's look](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m30s)

[because if once you write your own main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m32s)

[method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m35s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m36s)

[yeah we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m38s)

[shouldn't write a main method and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m39s)

[okay so my main method is commented out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m44s)

[just to be clear](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m46s)

[okay so then let's you can pick your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m48s)

[you can pick your favorite decompiler um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m52s)

[i currently like dn spy but that may end](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m55s)

[up needing to change as dn spy appears](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h14m58s)

[to be not getting much maintenance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m01s)

[uh let's go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m03s)

[let's just look at what this main method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m05s)

[does](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m07s)

[we go bin debug](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m11s)

[compilation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m14s)

[and then for wpf apps you actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m16s)

[you typically want to go after the dll](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m19s)

[not the exe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m21s)

[um that is the exact opposite if you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m24s)

[compiling for framework everything will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m28s)

[be under your exit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m30s)

[okay so if we go and look in here what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m31s)

[we are hunting for is the main method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m34s)

[and the generated main method that wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m36s)

[builds they actually put inside of that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m39s)

[app class as well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m41s)

[so there's a couple things to note right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m42s)

[away uh when we look at this main method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m45s)

[first of all the code that we actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m48s)

[want to do is instantiate a new app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m49s)

[object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m52s)

[call initialize component on it which is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m54s)

[actually what's going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m55s)

[run through all of the the generated](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h15m58s)

[xaml](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m00s)

[um and get all of that set up for us](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m01s)

[so you'll note it loads up the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m04s)

[app.xaml file sets the startup to our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m06s)

[main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m09s)

[and gets all of that content loaded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m11s)

[which is great and then it calls run and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m12s)

[this is this is what actually makes a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m14s)

[wpf application go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m16s)

[the other key thing that it does is it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m18s)

[sets um sta thread on top of your main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m20s)

[method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m23s)

[this is important um there are two types](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m24s)

[of threads sta and mta mta i won't dive](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m27s)

[into them too much](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m31s)

[feel free to google around](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m32s)

[the short version sta is for ui threads](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m34s)

[uh mta is not so that's the the 30](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m38s)

[second implementation but what we want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m40s)

[is we want this code here because we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m42s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m44s)

[make our main method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m46s)

[work like a real one because we actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m48s)

[need to start up the app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m49s)

[okay so there's there's that but we now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m52s)

[need to kind of separate some of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m54s)

[stuff apart](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m56s)

[so let's see here we want to not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h16m58s)

[necessarily do this because this run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m00s)

[call will be blocking this run call is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m02s)

[also blocking so we kind of have a a bit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m05s)

[of a mismatch of what is going on here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m07s)

[so first thing we're going to do is we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m10s)

[are going to do uh let's see i host](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m11s)

[and then let's break apart](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m15s)

[the run calls because that's that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m18s)

[ultimately what's going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m20s)

[problematic for us because we want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m22s)

[build up the host so that we can get all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m23s)

[of the benefits of our host builder](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m25s)

[and then that's actually a disposable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m28s)

[guy so we'll put them on a using](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m30s)

[statement](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m31s)

[clean up our app target type new we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m32s)

[on new c-sharp so we can get away with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m35s)

[that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m36s)

[um and then rather than calling run on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m37s)

[here what we're going to do is call](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m39s)

[host.start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m43s)

[and then we also need that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m44s)

[s t](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m46s)

[s t a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m48s)

[red](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m50s)

[attribute on there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m51s)

[because we need our method to behave](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m53s)

[uh we need our method to behave like a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h17m57s)

[real wpf app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m00s)

[okay so we've created the generic host](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m02s)

[builder](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m05s)

[we've we've started it so that it will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m06s)

[have done all of its setup stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m08s)

[we'll then do the regular wpf stuff and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m11s)

[then we will call go the only other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m14s)

[thing that's not really going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m16s)

[handled nicely for us here actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m18s)

[let's fire it up we might be able to get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m21s)

[away with this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m24s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m25s)

[oh program has more than one entry point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m26s)

[didn't i uncom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m29s)

[did i not set that up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m32s)

[uh there there there there's the entry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m36s)

[point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m39s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m40s)

[close all but this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m41s)

[boom what did i miss](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m45s)

[what did i miss oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m47s)

[ah that's what i missed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m50s)

[look at this sexy programmer](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m52s)

[james](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m56s)

[so my comment a moment ago about how the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h18m58s)

[um app.xaml is what uh wpf uses to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m00s)

[generate that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m05s)

[what actually triggers the generation of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m06s)

[that main method is the the ms build](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m08s)

[type of this guy so unfortunately by](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m12s)

[default you don't see it in your cs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m14s)

[project because it's just on by default](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m16s)

[which is convenient but it's actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m18s)

[this guy here this application](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m20s)

[definition by having it be an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m22s)

[application definition](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m23s)

[that causes it to generate um the main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m25s)

[method so what we want to do here is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m28s)

[downgrade this guy to page](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m29s)

[and of course it's gonna](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m31s)

[it's gonna be dumb so we're gonna cheat](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m34s)

[so it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m36s)

[i i don't i think this might be a vs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m38s)

[2022 bug because i ran into this before](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m41s)

[i don't know why um so you'll know it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m44s)

[turned off the application definition](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m46s)

[which is great but it did not add it to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m48s)

[the page set which is ultimately what we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m50s)

[want so let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m52s)

[because we still need it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m55s)

[we still need it to be run through the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m57s)

[xaml compiler so that we generate up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h19m59s)

[that initialize component method but we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m02s)

[don't want it to be treated as an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m05s)

[application definition where it also](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m06s)

[generates a mate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m11s)

[x-a-m-l spelling counts](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m14s)

[okay now let's try to build this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m18s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m23s)

[let's launch it and just make sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m24s)

[our app still works because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m26s)

[hopefully it should](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m28s)

[okay app has started we're happy we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m33s)

[running](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m36s)

[we've gone through the effort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m37s)

[actually setting up this generic host](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m39s)

[builder so we haven't actually gotten](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m40s)

[any di set up but we do have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m42s)

[we do have at least uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m46s)

[the the structure of the app going and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m49s)

[you can use this generic host builder](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m51s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m53s)

[in any of your apps the one other thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m54s)

[i will call out that you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m56s)

[should not do um in c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h20m58s)

[7.27371](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m03s)

[late 7 range](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m07s)

[microsoft added the wonderful ability to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m09s)

[do async main methods](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m11s)

[the problem if you do this because this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m13s)

[is great because you'll know there was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m16s)

[like start async and and what not on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m17s)

[here which is which is great because now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m20s)

[you can write this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m22s)

[this doesn't work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m23s)

[and specifically what does not work here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m26s)

[when you do an async uh main method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m28s)

[is this sta thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m32s)

[yeah you'll note the calling thread must](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m34s)

[be sta because many ui components](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m36s)

[require this it requires us to go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m38s)

[through and set up the sta thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m41s)

[well once you do an async main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m44s)

[this no longer will get applied to your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m47s)

[entry point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m51s)

[that's a problem don't do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m55s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h21m59s)

[short version four wpf applications](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m00s)

[where you need to set the sta thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m03s)

[attribute on top of your main do not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m04s)

[make it an async main because you will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m06s)

[not get an sta to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m09s)

[okay so let's go through and actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m16s)

[get this set up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m19s)

[let's talk about a little bit about what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m21s)

[the dependency injection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m22s)

[is so you'll hear people use the words](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m25s)

[uh container a lot when referring to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m26s)

[dependency injection because dependency](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m29s)

[injection is basically like a recipe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m31s)

[book](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m33s)

[so you can imagine if you want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m34s)

[build something up let's let's imagine](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m37s)

[and just ignore code for a moment let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m38s)

[pretend that i actually know how to cook](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m40s)

[and that i would like to make a cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m43s)

[when you go to make a cake it's going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m45s)

[take a bunch of things i'm going to need](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m47s)

[milk eggs flour lots of sugar sugar is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m49s)

[important um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m52s)

[all of these ingredients or pieces go in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m54s)

[and they're a dependency of actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m57s)

[being able to build up a cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h22m58s)

[so what your di container is is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m00s)

[effectively a recipe book telling you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m02s)

[okay where do i find the milk well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m04s)

[hopefully in the fridge right where do i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m06s)

[find the flour probably in the pantry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m08s)

[those types of things it knows all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m11s)

[the pieces that it has and so when you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m14s)

[say i would like to build a cake it goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m16s)

[got it let me look up the recipe for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m19s)

[cake okay cake takes the following](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m20s)

[things let me go get those things if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m22s)

[those things have other dependencies of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m25s)

[their own let me build those up and it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m27s)

[just kind of recursively gets all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m29s)

[that stuff and then hands you back a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m30s)

[cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m32s)

[which is great so that problem that i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m33s)

[had mentioned earlier where hey i want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m35s)

[to add in an imessenger so that i don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m37s)

[have the static property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m39s)

[now that whole recursive nature of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m41s)

[needing to add it to all the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m42s)

[constructors all the way up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m43s)

[that now goes away we now have a way of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m45s)

[creating things we simply ask our di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m47s)

[container hey i want one of these things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m49s)

[please give it to me and it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m53s)

[giving it to me whether that means](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m56s)

[creating it giving it back the other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h23m58s)

[thing that it can do is manage what's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m01s)

[called the lifetime of your objects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m02s)

[because some objects for example your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m04s)

[main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m06s)

[oftentimes you'll probably want only one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m08s)

[of them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m10s)

[hypothetically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m11s)

[some some objects you may want multiple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m13s)

[instances maybe you've got some sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m16s)

[like pop-out window and you want to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m18s)

[able to pop out multiple instances of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m19s)

[these things great your di container can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m21s)

[help you manage when you say give me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m24s)

[back a cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m25s)

[you can set up the lifetime of that cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m27s)

[to either be okay i only ever want one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m29s)

[cake we're not gonna make a bunch of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m31s)

[these for the birthday party we're doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m33s)

[one um or you can say you know what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m34s)

[every time somebody asks for a cake you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m36s)

[get a cake and you get a cake and you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m38s)

[get a cake](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m40s)

[that works too you can start to do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m41s)

[kind of centralized management of all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m43s)

[your dependencies and resources that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m46s)

[one of the nice things that the di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m48s)

[container gives you the other thing it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m49s)

[can do and i will see how far we get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m51s)

[tonight with it is um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m53s)

[once you start structuring your app for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m55s)

[those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m57s)

[for the di container to be able to build](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h24m58s)

[those up you can start doing what is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m00s)

[referred to as inversion of control so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m03s)

[you start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m05s)

[inverting how how the stuff is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m06s)

[structured which usually involves having](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m08s)

[your object constructors taken](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m11s)

[interfaces your objects built against](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m13s)

[the interface and then that helps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m15s)

[facilitate testing because now rather](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m17s)

[than having to create all the things for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m19s)

[the cake you only need that first layer](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m20s)

[so only the immediate dependencies for a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m23s)

[cake are what are after um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m26s)

[by the way watch your calamity stream](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m30s)

[and the c sharp building custom controls](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m32s)

[very interesting to watch oh thank you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m34s)

[very much justin bieber so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m36s)

[shameless self-promotion time because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m39s)

[for for people who are interested in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m46s)

[those ones as well so the the calamity](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m48s)

[stream is actually hosted](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m50s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m52s)

[go back to the beginning uh the calamity](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m53s)

[stream is actually hosted by my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h25m56s)

[uh on my the the company i work for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m00s)

[their youtube so feel free to check them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m02s)

[out they've been they host all of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m04s)

[local um user groups and so they we've](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m06s)

[been trying to do recordings and get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m08s)

[those posted that was one of them it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m09s)

[took a while to come up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m11s)

[so um if you are interested that one i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m13s)

[had a lot of fun doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m15s)

[um and building out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m17s)

[so if you want to see fun ways to abuse](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m20s)

[c](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m22s)

[um hopefully learn something there are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m23s)

[good techniques in there it's just i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m25s)

[take a useful technique and go to as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m28s)

[extreme off the end of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m30s)

[thing as i can so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m33s)

[also for anybody watching](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m34s)

[there's my youtube channel](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m38s)

[for those people who need it oh it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m40s)

[also you know right below me there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m42s)

[that too](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m45s)

[so let's look at actually setting this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m46s)

[up so di containers being that recipe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m49s)

[book are fairly stupid they do not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m51s)

[magically know how to make a cake they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m53s)

[do not know how to instantiate any](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m56s)

[objects you don't tell them about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h26m58s)

[there are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m00s)

[the non-microsoft di containers](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m01s)

[oftentimes will add in functionality](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m03s)

[that uses reflection so it uses code to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m06s)

[examine all of the the types in your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m09s)

[assembly and just automatically register](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m11s)

[them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m13s)

[that reflection comes with a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m14s)

[a hit because that takes processing time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m17s)

[to go and do but sometimes the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m19s)

[convenience of making sure your di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m21s)

[container knows about all your classes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m23s)

[is worth that hit so it's up to you to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m25s)

[decide if that's a good idea or not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m27s)

[it's something you can do the microsoft](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m30s)

[one by default doesn't do it because it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m32s)

[it wants to be performant you have to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m34s)

[tell it about all the types there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m36s)

[something you care about you have to add](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m38s)

[it so how we end up doing that in this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m40s)

[configure services this is effectively](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m42s)

[where we are going to lay out what goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m45s)

[in our recipe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m47s)

[so in our case we are going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m48s)

[services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m50s)

[uh add singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m51s)

[and then we're going to start with our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m54s)

[window because we would like it to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m55s)

[instantiate windows](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h27m58s)

[and you will note it doesn't know what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m00s)

[add singleton is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m01s)

[because it's an extension method so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m03s)

[for those people who missed it using the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m06s)

[the name space here um if it helps the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m08s)

[name of the two nuget packages we added](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m11s)

[are the same as the using statements you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m13s)

[need here to be able to do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m14s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m18s)

[our thing now knows how to call the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m19s)

[constructor of our main window so if we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m21s)

[tell it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m23s)

[create a window it will go through and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m24s)

[invoke the constructor now currently](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m26s)

[that's easy because right now our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m28s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m31s)

[is a default constructor any any di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m32s)

[container can figure out how to invoke a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m36s)

[default constructor it gets a lot more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m37s)

[interesting when we say okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m39s)

[by the way i want you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m41s)

[i want you to actually pass in my view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m45s)

[model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m46s)

[and so now what we're going to do and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m48s)

[actually let me put that property back](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m50s)

[real quick we're going to keep the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m51s)

[property around for a minute because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m53s)

[that's actually mildly helpful](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m55s)

[so let's go here and what we will do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h28m58s)

[we will go data context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m00s)

[gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m03s)

[a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m04s)

[view model gets view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m05s)

[okay so we'll just assign we'll take the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m10s)

[parameter and just assign it all the way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m12s)

[through](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m13s)

[um technically this does two assignments](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m14s)

[this to here this to here not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m17s)

[necessarily uh in there uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m19s)

[any type at any nesting level can get an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m22s)

[instance or only top level type any type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m25s)

[at any level and we're we're going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m27s)

[get into doing the nested instances](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m29s)

[because our main window view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m34s)

[creates up that theme object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m36s)

[and that we want to be able to get this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m38s)

[messenger in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m40s)

[so we'll get to that in a minute](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m42s)

[so as soon as we do this now now it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m43s)

[gotten interesting because in order for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m46s)

[the di container to instantiate the main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m47s)

[window it needs to know about main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m49s)

[window view model which currently](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m51s)

[doesn't so let's add that too](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m53s)

[we'll do services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m55s)

[add singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h29m58s)

[main window view model and in case it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m01s)

[not clear from the name add singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m03s)

[means that the di container is going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m05s)

[have one of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m07s)

[so it'll create the main window the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m08s)

[first time and anybody else who asks for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m10s)

[a main window is gonna get that same](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m11s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m13s)

[so singleton single one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m15s)

[done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m17s)

[no thinking](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m18s)

[um it's worth noting that oftentimes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m19s)

[singletons what maybe a singleton in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m21s)

[your running application](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m23s)

[may not be a singleton when it comes to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m25s)

[say running it through unit tests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m27s)

[because unit tests you oftentimes want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m29s)

[to run them fast in parallel quickly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m31s)

[which means you can't have one thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m34s)

[which means statics not so good because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m36s)

[then things can't run in parallel](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m40s)

[but for running application in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m41s)

[we're saying you know what main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m43s)

[we only want one of these things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m44s)

[okay and so our main window view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m47s)

[this guy here i believe still has a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m51s)

[default constructor and we're going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m53s)

[leave him this way for now we're going](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m55s)

[to change up this messenger in a minute](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m56s)

[but right now let's actually get the app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h30m58s)

[working with just the di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m00s)

[creating both of these now the the first](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m02s)

[problem we run into is initialize](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m05s)

[component](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m08s)

[do to do ah add singleton thread safe if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m11s)

[i ask it many times at the same time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m14s)

[great question so it's worth no so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m15s)

[um add singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m19s)

[i don't think so but it isn't going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m21s)

[but the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m25s)

[the ad call isn't going to be run on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m26s)

[multiple threads so specifically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m28s)

[this is going to be evaluated at the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m31s)

[point we call build](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m33s)

[so your di container is expected to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m34s)

[built up once at the beginning of your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m38s)

[running application and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m40s)

[the calls to getting things out those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m43s)

[will be thread safe for you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m46s)

[so that's where it actually matters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m47s)

[because typically getting the instances](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m49s)

[back out this guy can lazily](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m51s)

[it's not going to instantiate a main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m54s)

[window at the point where i call build](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m56s)

[it's going to wait to instantiate main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h31m58s)

[window until the first time i ask for an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m00s)

[instance out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m02s)

[so and that part will be threat safe for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m04s)

[you so i don't think ad singleton is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m05s)

[because i think the implementation for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m08s)

[almost all of these ad methods](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m09s)

[is just putting things into a dictionary](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m11s)

[or similar i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m14s)

[there's a bunch of nesting in here but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m15s)

[ultimately it comes down to what call in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m18s)

[adding a service descriptor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m20s)

[which i think those going to a list](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m22s)

[regardless um this thing i don't think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m24s)

[is but i don't think the ad call itself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m27s)

[matters just the retrieval](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m31s)

[but if i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m32s)

[uh ask for the first time many times](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m34s)

[that will be thread safe so if you run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m37s)

[into a situation where you say give me a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m39s)

[main so after you call build um and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m41s)

[actually we're about to do it here real](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m43s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m45s)

[let me show that real quick because i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m46s)

[think that will hammer home what we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m47s)

[doing so what we actually want to do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m49s)

[we actually want to get the thing out so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m51s)

[it's going to be host](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m53s)

[services get required service so there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m55s)

[are two methods on here that are worth](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h32m58s)

[noting there's get service and get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m00s)

[required service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m01s)

[the difference between them get required](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m03s)

[service throws an exception if it gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m06s)

[back a null get service might hand you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m08s)

[back a null](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m11s)

[so for what it's worth so but what but i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m12s)

[what i think you're proposing here is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m14s)

[what happens if i if i put this off in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m17s)

[multiple threads and call](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m19s)

[get service multiple times really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m21s)

[quickly you'll still only get the one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m23s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m25s)

[this guy here will be threat safe for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m26s)

[you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m28s)

[this guy i don't think is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m29s)

[but again this guy should be done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m31s)

[at build time because you really can't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m35s)

[start running your app until after](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m37s)

[you've gotten your the host for your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m39s)

[application up and running](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m43s)

[for what it's worth which is another](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m45s)

[reason why the the microsoft eye](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m46s)

[container doesn't necessarily do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m48s)

[reflection iterating over all the types](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m51s)

[in your assembly because um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m52s)

[uh because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m56s)

[that would add startup hits](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h33m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m00s)

[uh you have asked synchronously uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m02s)

[correct but for example if i were to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m09s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m22s)

[innumerable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m24s)

[i don't have any of my using statements](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m26s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m29s)

[stop stop stop stop helping me uh repeat](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m31s)

[and uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m34s)

[zero and give it to me i don't know 100](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m36s)

[times right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m40s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m43s)

[we're gonna just throw that guy away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m44s)

[but i think this is what you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m48s)

[proposing so if i if i do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m50s)

[i think the question is how many that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m52s)

[how many times is main window going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m54s)

[be instantiated](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m56s)

[right because this is now going to spin](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h34m57s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m00s)

[some number of threads](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m01s)

[probably 10](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m02s)

[based upon what i know about my system](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m04s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m07s)

[start hitting this very rapidly so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m08s)

[effectively giving those two calls](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m11s)

[simultaneously here we can do roofing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m12s)

[putting right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m16s)

[i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m38s)

[returns the incremented value perfect](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m42s)

[if this is greater than one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m44s)

[uh breakpoint](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m48s)

[all right so that'll that'll get us in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m51s)

[here and so this should](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m52s)

[do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m55s)

[i'm going to leave this here we'll come](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m56s)

[back to it but i've got it set with a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m58s)

[breakpoint we'll prove this out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h35m59s)

[um but we have to change out our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m01s)

[initialize component first real quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m03s)

[because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m05s)

[what's what's wrong with this right now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m06s)

[is the the startup uri](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m08s)

[in our app.xaml is set to main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m11s)

[which is fine except for the fact that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m14s)

[we don't want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m16s)

[wpf created in the main window for us](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m18s)

[we want to create it from our di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m21s)

[container that way we can deal with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m22s)

[dependencies so step one we're going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m24s)

[just get rid of that because we don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m26s)

[want that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m27s)

[i don't know why that's up on the same](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m28s)

[one so we'll clean that up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m30s)

[so what we want to do instead is we want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m32s)

[to actually go through and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m35s)

[create the main window ourselves just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m37s)

[like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m39s)

[wpf would end up doing it for us](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m40s)

[and then building that out so what we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m43s)

[want to do here is app.main window gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m45s)

[i'm just going to steal this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m48s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m52s)

[so we will grab the instance there and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m55s)

[there's a fun little bug in here well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h36m57s)

[it's not a bug it's by design i think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m00s)

[it feels dumb](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m02s)

[but when you when you manually do the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m04s)

[main window you have to make it visible](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m06s)

[it's kind of dumb it's kind of dumb it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m09s)

[something that the when it would pull it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m11s)

[out via the xaml it would do that for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m14s)

[you when you do it in code you got to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m15s)

[it yourself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m17s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m18s)

[it's annoying um but that should be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m20s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m24s)

[i'm gonna move this down below the 4-h](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m26s)

[it doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m28s)

[okay now we should be able to launch the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m31s)

[app and we should be able to confirm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m34s)

[that we don't get multiple counts](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m36s)

[fire it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m47s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m50s)

[oh and we run into a lovely little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m52s)

[problem where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m55s)

[i'm trying to instantiate a ui object on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h37m58s)

[a background thread so my world falls](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m01s)

[apart so that's that's exciting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m07s)

[you know what i'm gonna just comment](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m09s)

[this out and not think about it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m10s)

[there should only be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m13s)

[one reference to it anyway](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m14s)

[so we're just gonna do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m17s)

[this for the moment and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m19s)

[and not worry about it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m22s)

[uh oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m29s)

[i am cree](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m31s)

[okay fine fine fine fine so when i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m32s)

[calling that parallel for each it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m36s)

[doing it on a background thread and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m37s)

[creating a window on a background thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m39s)

[no bueno um let's do let's do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m42s)

[instead rather than doing it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m45s)

[we can prove that we don't have to prove](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m48s)

[it with the window class we can prove it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m49s)

[with a different class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m51s)

[but let's do it with a different class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m53s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h38m56s)

[go back here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m00s)

[because we can we can just do it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m08s)

[oh because it was the main window where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m09s)

[we did the count so let's just move this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m10s)

[into the view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m12s)

[and we'll do it on the viewmodel class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m14s)

[because the viewmodel was also](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m22s)

[registered as a singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m23s)

[so we'll just we'll test it on that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m26s)

[uh message queue oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m34s)

[the uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m38s)

[humbug](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m40s)

[the message queue is still](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m42s)

[i uncommented that thinking that was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m45s)

[inside of my window and it's not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m47s)

[oh hang on hang on we can we can prove](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m50s)

[this we can prove it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h39m52s)

[and there we go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m05s)

[app launches](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m07s)

[let me just make sure i had my break](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m08s)

[point set on that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m10s)

[well of course i didn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m12s)

[try this again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m14s)

[oh hello houston](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m19s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m22s)

[that's exciting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m25s)

[where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m32s)

[oh that's why okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m39s)

[okay i was like something is not jiving](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m42s)

[with what i know um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m44s)

[we missed a change](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m46s)

[so the the fact that i saw that the call](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m49s)

[stack went through initialized component](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m51s)

[meant that it's been done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m53s)

[here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m55s)

[we got to take it out of our xaml](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m56s)

[okay we only want to do it in one place](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h40m59s)

[one place one place is good one place is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m02s)

[good let's try this again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m04s)

[try this again i was i was going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m07s)

[very shocked because i was like i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m08s)

[pretty sure that's problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m15s)

[now it is working as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m16s)

[expected something something scared me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m18s)

[it's like there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m21s)

[i'm i'm very confident in this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m23s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m26s)

[view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m28s)

[only one instance was created we never](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m30s)

[got inside of our increment more than](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m32s)

[once](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m34s)

[when we were only getting when we were](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m34s)

[only creating it via the di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m36s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m40s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m41s)

[so yes the the get service and get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m42s)

[required service those things will be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m45s)

[thread safe for you those are those are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m46s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m48s)

[so you don't have to worry about you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m50s)

[know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m52s)

[somehow getting multiple instances of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m53s)

[something you declared singleton because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m54s)

[certain objects like maybe a cache](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m56s)

[object or similar you probably only want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h41m58s)

[one okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m00s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m03s)

[much better](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m06s)

[great question though](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m10s)

[i'm gonna turn that off](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m11s)

[because in c sharp you don't performance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m13s)

[problems you have memory problems memory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m15s)

[problems and memory problems](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m16s)

[okay let's talk](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m18s)

[interfaces then so specifically this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m20s)

[messenger so this is one of the ones and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m23s)

[initially when i had done this i did](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m29s)

[the messenger class just as a static](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m30s)

[property because i needed to share it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m32s)

[because in this situation this messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m34s)

[all objects for this thing to work need](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m36s)

[to get the same instance so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m39s)

[for people who may not have seen this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m41s)

[before this is something that comes from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m43s)

[the microsoft mvvm toolkit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m44s)

[it's effectively a published subscribe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m46s)

[model or pub sub that you'll hear it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m48s)

[called](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m50s)

[two things get a hold of it one piece of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m51s)

[code sends a message another piece of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m53s)

[code can register up for a given type of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m55s)

[message and then all the people who](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m57s)

[registered for it get it back you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h42m58s)

[kind of think of it like a distributed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m00s)

[event um some people call them event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m01s)

[hubs and someone right this is just kind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m03s)

[of a small in-memory one because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m05s)

[oftentimes in your application you kind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m07s)

[of need that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m09s)

[small distributed messaging um things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m10s)

[like xamarin forms and maui have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m12s)

[built-in class to do similar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m14s)

[in the mvvm toolkit there are a couple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m16s)

[implementations of imessenger one is the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m18s)

[weak reference messenger which is the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m21s)

[name implies](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m23s)

[if you register for a message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m24s)

[um you have to pass an instance to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m26s)

[yourself to say hey i want to know about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m28s)

[messages and this guy here only](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m30s)

[maintains a weak reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m32s)

[which means if the messenger is the only](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m34s)

[thing holding a reference to you you get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m37s)

[garbage collected this reference is weak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m39s)

[so and then there's also another strong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m41s)

[reference one i tend to favor the weak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m43s)

[reference one um the mvvm light library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m45s)

[that this was based on that was how that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m48s)

[implementation worked that's usually how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m50s)

[i i build my code with the idea that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m52s)

[registering for a message is weak and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m55s)

[not gonna hold a strong reference to me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m57s)

[um if you use the other one the strong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h43m59s)

[reference one you gotta make sure to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m01s)

[unregister so that you get garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m02s)

[collected](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m04s)

[so uh depends on what you're doing you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m05s)

[can pick your favorite um this is my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m07s)

[preference though so but the fact that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m08s)

[this thing needs to be a singleton and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m11s)

[shared](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m13s)

[that doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m14s)

[uh week reference events slower than](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m16s)

[common events](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m19s)

[um so the pub sub model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m20s)

[uh can certainly be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m23s)

[slower than than regular events or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m26s)

[common events um because c sharp if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m29s)

[use like the event keyword what that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m31s)

[ends up giving you is what's called a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m34s)

[multicast delegate it's effectively a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m35s)

[delegate object that's actually a list](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m37s)

[of delegates and when the event gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m38s)

[raised it just goes down the list and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m40s)

[goes fire fire fire fire fire fire](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m44s)

[this one here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m45s)

[i don't know if they necessarily](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m47s)

[performance tested it against a regular](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m49s)

[event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m51s)

[but there was a bunch of work done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m52s)

[oh shoot i am blanking on the guy's name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m55s)

[at the time he was an open source](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h44m59s)

[contributor but he's i believe he now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m00s)

[works for microsoft uh on the project](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m02s)

[but when they rewrote this from the mvvm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m05s)

[light library um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m08s)

[they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m10s)

[they did a lot of performance tuning and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m12s)

[so the api for the imessenger is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m14s)

[little different than mvvm light](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m16s)

[it's a little more obnoxious but the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m18s)

[performance gains were like a hundred](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m20s)

[fold](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m21s)

[it's it's insane so this this one is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m22s)

[fairly performant uh can we build all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m25s)

[applications](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m27s)

[uh only on weak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m28s)

[references um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m30s)

[yes uh so in c sharp the weak reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m33s)

[there there is just a straight up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m36s)

[uh weak reference class that you can use](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m39s)

[to hold on to a weak reference it is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m41s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m45s)

[the only thing with a weak reference and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m46s)

[you can build things up that way right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m48s)

[so this by default everything's a strong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m51s)

[reference when the garbage collector is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m53s)

[looking at your app to figure out what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m54s)

[objects aren't being referenced anymore](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m56s)

[these strong references are you know how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h45m58s)

[it follows down through the tree to know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m00s)

[what it can clean up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m02s)

[weak references don't count for that so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m03s)

[those references don't go across so you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m06s)

[can build an entire app on weak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m07s)

[references](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m09s)

[the problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m11s)

[with it and i think oftentimes why the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m13s)

[the weak references being slower it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m15s)

[comes into play is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m17s)

[then every time you go to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m20s)

[access it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m22s)

[you now need to check and make sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m24s)

[you actually got something back and that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m25s)

[week ref because you have to first take](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m28s)

[that weak reference into a strong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m30s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m32s)

[and then invoke on it there's now two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m32s)

[steps where there used to be one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m34s)

[um i wouldn't build an entire app on it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m36s)

[but i definitely build entire apps on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m38s)

[just using the weak reference message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m41s)

[um so let's come back to our app.xaml](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m44s)

[and let's add that guy in so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m47s)

[services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m50s)

[add singleton because once again this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m51s)

[something i only want one of and i want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m53s)

[it to be an i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m55s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m56s)

[and specifically the implementation that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h46m58s)

[i want for that guy is going to be the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m00s)

[weak reference messenger so we'll slap](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m02s)

[both of those in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m04s)

[and sometimes i like to move this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m08s)

[configure services and the host builder](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m10s)

[off into its own class you'll note that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m12s)

[the registration for these services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m14s)

[uh oftentimes this means you get a using](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m17s)

[to like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m19s)

[the recipe book for all the stuff we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m26s)

[going to build up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m29s)

[this thing can kind of get fairly large](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m30s)

[and definitely definitely](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m33s)

[test this we'll see if we get all the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m35s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m39s)

[hoping we do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m40s)

[because that shows off the other the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m41s)

[other big part and i want to be clear on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m43s)

[something too if you are just starting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m46s)

[out on wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m47s)

[i wouldn't tell you to jump into this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m49s)

[first just like when i was talking about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m50s)

[the mvvm if you're just learning wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m52s)

[just get the app working first get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m55s)

[something small up and running make sure](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m57s)

[you're familiar with xaml get yourself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h47m59s)

[over that learning hurdle first then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m01s)

[tack mvvm on it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m03s)

[get that get over that learning hurdle](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m05s)

[next](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m07s)

[then start to bring in some of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m08s)

[more advanced concepts if you try to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m09s)

[bite the whole thing off there is a very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m11s)

[steep learning curve and if you aren't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m13s)

[familiar with a lot of this stuff that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m14s)

[a lot to chew off at once take it in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m16s)

[bite-size pieces highly recommended okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m18s)

[so we've told our di container about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m21s)

[imessenger which now means we can come](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m23s)

[back here and we can get rid of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m25s)

[sort of get rid of this guy here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m27s)

[we'll eventually kill him off almost](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m31s)

[completely um but this guy in this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m33s)

[messenger here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m35s)

[we can now bring him in so i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m38s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m41s)

[messenger and you'll note i downgraded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m42s)

[him from a static property to an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m45s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m47s)

[because in this case i don't want my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m49s)

[view model making assumptions about how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m51s)

[many instances of messenger there are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m53s)

[i want it to just trust whatever it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m56s)

[given and use that so what we'll do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h48m58s)

[first is we will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m01s)

[messenger gets messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m02s)

[and just and just for fun it's it's not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m05s)

[reasonably possible for this to happen](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m08s)

[but we'll just make darn sure that we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m10s)

[don't get a null because i'd rather get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m12s)

[an argument no exception here than a no](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m13s)

[reference exception here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m16s)

[because no reference exceptions are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m18s)

[almost](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m19s)

[exclusively programmer messed up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m20s)

[that's pretty much what a no reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m24s)

[exception means](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m26s)

[always](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m27s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m31s)

[so we'll do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m32s)

[we'll get that built up and then i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m34s)

[thought there was going to be one more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m36s)

[case where this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m38s)

[bit us where did that theme class go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m40s)

[uh you're here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m44s)

[ah this guy so now that this guy is no](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m47s)

[longer a static property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m50s)

[this class here now needs to know about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m52s)

[that messenger so what we're gonna do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m54s)

[we're gonna just pass it in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h49m55s)

[uh messin](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m00s)

[jer spelling is hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m03s)

[oh and we are we capitalize it so for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m05s)

[people unfamiliar with this this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m08s)

[called a positional record so positional](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m09s)

[record meaning i've done this sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m12s)

[declaration up here right in line next](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m13s)

[to the class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m16s)

[this ends up doing several things for me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m17s)

[this will generate a constructor with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m21s)

[this signature this will then also take](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m22s)

[each of these parameters and create](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m25s)

[properties with them uh the which is the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m26s)

[reason why i capitalized them because it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m29s)

[looks a little weird because these are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m31s)

[used for two things both the properties](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m33s)

[and the constructor signature it's gonna](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m35s)

[look the casing is gonna look weird for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m37s)

[one of them because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m39s)

[normally lowercase the constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m40s)

[parameters and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m42s)

[uppercase the the property names](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m43s)

[so i can't have both](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m48s)

[so the compromise is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m50s)

[make the constructor signature look a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m52s)

[little weird and make the properties](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m54s)

[look correct because ultimately with di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m56s)

[we don't call the constructor anyway so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h50m59s)

[eh doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m01s)

[okay so now we take this guy in as a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m03s)

[constructor and then this guy goes away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m05s)

[right so back to where we were](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m09s)

[and then if we jump back over to here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m10s)

[we now have little red box here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m14s)

[and this guy here takes in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m16s)

[a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m19s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m20s)

[but i need to make this method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m22s)

[non-static so it can access the instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m23s)

[property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m25s)

[poof](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m28s)

[uh it may be that the injection is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m28s)

[unsafe from the point of view any](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m31s)

[developer for anywhere can get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m33s)

[everything he wants](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m35s)

[although his place of work may not imply](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m36s)

[work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m39s)

[with a certain service but he gets it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m40s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m46s)

[i think i would probably so i don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m51s)

[doubt that there's probably cases like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m53s)

[that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h51m55s)

[but i think that i would use that as an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m01s)

[exception case not necessarily the way i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m04s)

[would design it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m06s)

[and i think that might be a little more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m09s)

[clear down when we get to getting rid of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m10s)

[this constructor here because right now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m13s)

[this theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m15s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m17s)

[this is tightly coupling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m18s)

[main window to this guy's constructor if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m20s)

[i go and say okay now theme color needs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m22s)

[another dependency messenger was easy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m24s)

[because i already had it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m27s)

[uh oh don't worry don't worry at all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m28s)

[justin bieber](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m32s)

[but if i add another dependency so you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m33s)

[know you know my service as a third](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m36s)

[parameter now i have to add it to the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m38s)

[constructor but then main window view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m40s)

[model needs that just so that it can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m42s)

[pass it in here we want to break that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m44s)

[coupling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m46s)

[but we're going to do that in a minute](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m47s)

[but let's make let's once again make](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m48s)

[sure the app works still so we should be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m49s)

[in a we should be in a good state with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m52s)

[the messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m53s)

[working](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h52m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m01s)

[this should work and then just for fun](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m04s)

[what we're going to do is we'll come in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m06s)

[here i think this is set to the same](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m07s)

[theme but i think if i change this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m10s)

[background here to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m14s)

[i don't know if that's going to make a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m17s)

[big difference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m18s)

[yeah you can see the green the green](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m20s)

[color change](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m21s)

[so the met that's the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m26s)

[so this apply button is what's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m27s)

[triggering that message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m28s)

[back back out so i know that my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m30s)

[imessenger instances work so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m32s)

[perfect huzzah it's flying](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m35s)

[let's go back here so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m38s)

[right now i had just been registering](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m39s)

[all of my services as singleton and that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m41s)

[is that is one end of a spectrum when we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m44s)

[talk about object lifetime of getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m46s)

[back just one thing the other side of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m49s)

[the spectrum is always create a new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m51s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m53s)

[so on the other side of it is what we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m54s)

[got is service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m57s)

[uh and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h53m59s)

[transient and so transient](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m01s)

[is the opposite end of the spectrum from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m04s)

[singleton rather than getting one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m06s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m07s)

[always create a new one every time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m08s)

[somebody calls get service or get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m10s)

[required service always give back a new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m12s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m14s)

[what's uh i i don't know if this this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m15s)

[completely clear or not but even though](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m17s)

[i'm i'm using the phrase every time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m19s)

[someone calls get service or get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m22s)

[required service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m23s)

[typically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m24s)

[you aren't making those calls yourself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m26s)

[typically you don't once you get the di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m30s)

[container set up and you get everything](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m32s)

[rolling at the top which is what we did](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m34s)

[here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m38s)

[oftentimes you won't so this like the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m39s)

[services property is a nice service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m42s)

[provider typically you won't access the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m43s)

[service provider directly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m45s)

[beyond that point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m48s)

[this will be the one time effectively](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m49s)

[because wpf doesn't the framework](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m52s)

[doesn't have built-in support for this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m54s)

[that we basically retrieve the top level](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m56s)

[thing from our di container and then we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h54m58s)

[let di handle the rest of our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m00s)

[instantiation for us](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m02s)

[and we just go hands off so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m04s)

[i'm saying get required service but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m06s)

[understand that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m08s)

[when i call main window the di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m09s)

[is actually responsible for calling get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m12s)

[required service or get service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m14s)

[for everything that my that my view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m17s)

[model actually needs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m19s)

[which is great that is ultimately what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m21s)

[we what we want to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m26s)

[so let's let's change this up because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m27s)

[right now we have this really tight](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m29s)

[coupling down here to this constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m31s)

[and i would like i would like to break](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m34s)

[that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m39s)

[well actually real quick before before i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m40s)

[do that one comment i will make so there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m41s)

[there's ad singleton ad transient and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m44s)

[those are the two built-in ones there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m46s)

[a handful of di containers that if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m48s)

[add them instead um they'll add a little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m50s)

[bit more fine-grained control on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m53s)

[spectrum for where for how often you get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m55s)

[a new instance the other built-in one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m57s)

[that's worth noting is add scoped um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h55m59s)

[this is kind of so if if you've got add](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m02s)

[singleton here add transient here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m05s)

[add scoped is kind of in the middle so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m08s)

[what this does is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m10s)

[if you were to create a scope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m12s)

[all instances within that scope will be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m15s)

[resolved will be resolved as though they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m17s)

[were a singleton but once you jump out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m19s)

[of that scope now and into a new scope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m21s)

[then you're going to get new instances](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m24s)

[again so it's a way of uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m25s)

[basically i where you kind of want a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m27s)

[singleton but kind of don't so for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m30s)

[example um in asp.net core when you have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m31s)

[a controller](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m35s)

[the controllers by default are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m36s)

[registered as scoped so that each](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m38s)

[request that comes into the server gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m40s)

[a separate instance because you don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m42s)

[necessarily want um two requests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m43s)

[potentially sharing data across that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m46s)

[could be bad](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m48s)

[um and so the controllers by default are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m49s)

[registered as scoped instances so when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m51s)

[those come in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m53s)

[each uh request will get its own](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m54s)

[instance of the controller those get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m56s)

[returned away we go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h56m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m00s)

[uh task run build theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m01s)

[this place runs synchronously ah close](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m07s)

[no and that's actually another thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m08s)

[that i'd like to clean up here in a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m10s)

[minute as well so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m11s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m13s)

[this is putting load themes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m15s)

[and this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m17s)

[this is bad practice so don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m18s)

[don't trust this we'll we'll make this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m20s)

[we'll make this better this was quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m22s)

[and dirty approach so the problem is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m24s)

[load themes is going off to the the hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m26s)

[drive and reading all of those files](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m29s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m33s)

[that can occasionally be slow](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m34s)

[and crea and typically inside of your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m36s)

[constructor you don't want to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m38s)

[large amounts of work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m40s)

[and in theory you shouldn't do this in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m42s)

[the constructor anyway but this is quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m44s)

[and dirty so task run what is what it is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m45s)

[doing is it is creating a task and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m48s)

[registering it for the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m53s)

[the background worker queue to process](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m54s)

[those tasks so anytime you have a task](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m56s)

[the background worker yeah i'm not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h57m59s)

[awaiting it so it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m01s)

[creates the task cues it up on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m02s)

[background worker](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m04s)

[so it will start running](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m06s)

[some point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m08s)

[but it allows the constructor to return](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m10s)

[immediately this is oftentimes very bad](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m12s)

[because this is this gets you into the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m15s)

[case this is subtly an um like having an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m17s)

[async void thingy in here because it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m20s)

[not a weighted if an exception gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m22s)

[thrown up out of this um it bubbles all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m24s)

[the way up and then crashes the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m27s)

[application so that's that's not not a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m28s)

[great thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m30s)

[which is why this thing has an explicit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m31s)

[try catch to prevent any exceptions from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m33s)

[bubbling out because i know it's being](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m36s)

[invoked](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m38s)

[poorly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m39s)

[in general you should not do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m42s)

[large work in the constructor that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m45s)

[problem one normally this should go into](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m46s)

[an async method somewhere else that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m49s)

[maybe invoked after the window is shown](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m51s)

[or similar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m53s)

[the only two places this gets invoked is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m55s)

[when the refresh button gets clicked or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m57s)

[at startup](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h58m59s)

[so but we will we will pull this apart](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m00s)

[because this static call here because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m02s)

[task.run is another static it is tightly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m04s)

[coupling us](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m07s)

[and so if we were to try to write tests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m09s)

[over our main window view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m10s)

[this could quickly become problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m12s)

[you can imagine wanting to write a test](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m14s)

[that tests for an empty directory and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m16s)

[writing a test that tests loading a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m19s)

[single file](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m20s)

[well that now becomes really problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m22s)

[because i can't control that anymore at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m24s)

[least not in parallel i'd have to run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m27s)

[those tests one at a time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m30s)

[but we will we will clean this guy up so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m32s)

[even though it's not awaited this still](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m34s)

[will get cued up and executed it just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m36s)

[means that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m38s)

[uh the completion of instantiating the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m40s)

[constructor um the constructor will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m42s)

[finish before this before load themes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m44s)

[does](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m46s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m49s)

[where are we going all right we want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m50s)

[clean up our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m52s)

[our theme creation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m57s)

[um the other the other problem with this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=00h59m58s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m00s)

[object here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m02s)

[is this constructor contains sort of two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m03s)

[types of parameters it contains](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m06s)

[something that's going to be resolved](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m09s)

[from the di container the messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m10s)

[and it contains some bit of data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m13s)

[and so we now have two sources of where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m17s)

[this stuff needs to come from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m20s)

[when we when we instantiate this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m22s)

[because if we look uh at where we build](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m24s)

[this guy up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m26s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m28s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m35s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m36s)

[so if we look here one of the parameters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m38s)

[is coming here one of them is coming](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m40s)

[from the messenger but really we could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m42s)

[have the di container resolve this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m43s)

[so when you run into this kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m45s)

[situation which is oftentimes one of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m47s)

[first things people hit when they start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m49s)

[using di containers is they go well hang](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m51s)

[on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m53s)

[my constructor has data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m53s)

[and it also has di stuff now one option](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m56s)

[is refactor your object such that that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h00m59s)

[not possible](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m01s)

[right you can see value here isn't a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m02s)

[problem it's not going into the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m04s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m05s)

[but color name is and so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m08s)

[if you can reasonably refactor your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m10s)

[object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m13s)

[fine go for it but in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m13s)

[i would say it really doesn't make sense](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m16s)

[we only want to set this name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m18s)

[once](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m20s)

[and we don't want to do it again we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m21s)

[don't want to have this situation where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m22s)

[this property exists](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m24s)

[or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m26s)

[could be assignable we want to keep the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m28s)

[nice immutable record that we have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m30s)

[so the generalized pattern for doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m32s)

[this is what is called a factory pattern](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m34s)

[so rather than having](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m37s)

[the di container necessarily know how to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m40s)

[create theme colors what we do is we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m42s)

[tell it how to create a factory for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m45s)

[theme colors and then we will use that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m47s)

[and that way a factory can take in any](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m50s)

[amount of dependencies that we have and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m53s)

[it can deal with kind of crossing that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m55s)

[boundary](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m56s)

[now um i'm going to do this the long way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h01m58s)

[first and then we're going to clean this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m01s)

[up so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m02s)

[a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m03s)

[a naive implementation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m09s)

[might look something like this fat](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m11s)

[nope nope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m14s)

[battery](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m15s)

[get my mic out of the way so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m19s)

[and we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m21s)

[theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m23s)

[we'll call it create string](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m25s)

[uh name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m28s)

[okay so we'll have a theme factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m30s)

[and then we so this is a lot of code](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m32s)

[there is there's a one liner we can do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m35s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m36s)

[oh man the auto code is so so strong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m38s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m40s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m42s)

[so we've got this method here which is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m43s)

[great i'm just gonna expression body](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m45s)

[this guy um and the and typically when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m47s)

[you're writing these factories the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m50s)

[factory's job is really just to call the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m51s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m53s)

[he is basically the glue that allows you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m54s)

[to link incoming data with um di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h02m57s)

[dependencies so we do this and we do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m00s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m04s)

[and then we come over here and we go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m06s)

[well where are we going to get the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m07s)

[messenger from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m08s)

[well we can come in here we can do i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m10s)

[uh autocode a property for me please and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m16s)

[now i've got a nice easy easy way of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m19s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m21s)

[so i've got this nice theme factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m23s)

[great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m25s)

[so there's a nice interface here i'll](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m26s)

[explain the the purpose of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m28s)

[interface here in a moment](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m30s)

[um but you'll note](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m32s)

[calling the constructor for theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m35s)

[now comes partially from some incoming](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m36s)

[data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m39s)

[and partially from a di dependency that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m40s)

[was resolved from the constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m42s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m46s)

[we come over we come back to our di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m47s)

[registration and we need to we need to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m49s)

[teach it about that factory so services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m50s)

[add a singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m53s)

[uh i theme color factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h03m56s)

[so we'll register that up and then our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m00s)

[main window view model this guy changes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m02s)

[because he really doesn't care all he](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m04s)

[needs to know is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m07s)

[i have a string i want a theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m08s)

[back i don't want to think too hard so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m11s)

[we can do something like i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m13s)

[theme color factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m17s)

[theme color factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m19s)

[let's see create an assign property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m21s)

[great great great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m23s)

[uh add a null check for me great and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m24s)

[then we're gonna come down here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m27s)

[and then rather than call a new theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m29s)

[color here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m30s)

[what we're gonna do is we will go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m32s)

[colors add](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m34s)

[theme color factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m36s)

[and we'll call the create method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m38s)

[and actually we might we might go one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m43s)

[step further let's pass value in two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m45s)

[while we're at it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m47s)

[uh let's see oh and it is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m48s)

[color name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m52s)

[but this guy's unhappy because my my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m56s)

[signatures don't match but let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h04m58s)

[let's fix this uh what is value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m01s)

[string nullable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m04s)

[uh how about initial](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m06s)

[value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m10s)

[we'll have this we'll have this guy just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m11s)

[do the value assignment for us too](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m13s)

[because why not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m17s)

[this needs to be added to both the class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m20s)

[and the interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m22s)

[blah blah blah that goes there that goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m24s)

[there that goes there and now this works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m26s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m29s)

[that was a lot of code let's let's one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m30s)

[run it make sure it works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m33s)

[so this is what the those individual](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m35s)

[lists of colors on the main screen](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m37s)

[if we see that list show up with values](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m39s)

[we'll know that we were able to create](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m41s)

[the instances](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m43s)

[so if we bring this guy over](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m47s)

[okay so we can see it loaded up all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m49s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m52s)

[this is a lot of typing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m53s)

[so just to reiterate this is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m56s)

[generalized pattern that can be applied](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h05m58s)

[in any number of ways](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m01s)

[there are shortcuts though however it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m02s)

[important to understand the the basic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m05s)

[pieces of the pattern so in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m07s)

[rather than tightly coupling ourselves](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m10s)

[to one particular instance of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m12s)

[factory we put an interface out there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m13s)

[this will will largely come into play](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m16s)

[when we get to testing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m18s)

[this interface here is backed by this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m20s)

[particular implementation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m23s)

[but in terms of our main window view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m24s)

[model it doesn't know about the actual](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m26s)

[implementation all it knows about is i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m28s)

[have a thingy that can create theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m30s)

[colors for me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m33s)

[and that thingy can create me a theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m34s)

[color given a a couple strings](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m36s)

[perfect easy mode i don't have to think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m40s)

[too hard that's exactly what i want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m43s)

[because that's all my main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m45s)

[actually needs it doesn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m46s)

[care](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m49s)

[how that thing got created it just cares](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m50s)

[that it does get created so if there are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m52s)

[any additional dependencies i've now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m55s)

[isolated them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m56s)

[well within here which is great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h06m58s)

[um and i don't have to in the event that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m01s)

[you know this guy's constructor changes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m03s)

[i update it in one place i don't have to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m06s)

[update it in multiple places](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m08s)

[perfect um the factory the the factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m10s)

[pattern is also a situation where you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m14s)

[might actually want to do things like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m16s)

[bring in the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m19s)

[i service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m20s)

[uh provider because occasionally your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m22s)

[factories may need to do some sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m25s)

[resolution stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m27s)

[depends on depends on your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m30s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m31s)

[but in general if you do need to have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m33s)

[some sort of glue between](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m35s)

[how do i create objects there needs to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m37s)

[be some custom logic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m39s)

[and i need to do different stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m41s)

[oftentimes a factory pattern works very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m43s)

[well for this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m45s)

[it allows you to kind of make that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m47s)

[separation and break apart that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m48s)

[constructor call](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m52s)

[okay but i promised there was an easier](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m53s)

[way to do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m55s)

[because this is a lot of typing i do not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m56s)

[want to do this every single time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h07m58s)

[in general if i can refactor a way to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m02s)

[have my constructor not take in data and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m04s)

[have my constructors only take in um di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m07s)

[resolvable dependencies that's generally](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m10s)

[preferable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m13s)

[and the the exception cases tend to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m15s)

[things like this that are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m19s)

[sort of doing multiple things so in wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m20s)

[i often run into this situation where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m22s)

[i'm creating a view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m25s)

[um like for example i've got a view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m27s)

[model to pull up in a dialogue i want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m29s)

[pre-populate that dialogue with some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m31s)

[data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m33s)

[and that data really needs to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m35s)

[available in the constructor i don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m36s)

[want to pass it in later](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m38s)

[therefore i need to do something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m40s)

[this so those are the types of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m42s)

[situations where i typically run into](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m43s)

[this um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m45s)

[for things like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m47s)

[for most other cases it's usually better](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m48s)

[to try to consider whether that data](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m51s)

[really needs to be available in the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m53s)

[constructor or whether that data could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m54s)

[be provided later is it really a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m56s)

[dependency is my theme color going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h08m58s)

[in an invalid state if a name isn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m00s)

[immediately provided](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m03s)

[if the answer is yes then it really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m05s)

[should go into the constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m06s)

[if it could be provided later](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m09s)

[maybe a property maybe some sort of init](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m10s)

[method etc](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m13s)

[uh i register instant](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m17s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m18s)

[i register instances for all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m22s)

[applications i can get any of them from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m24s)

[any place](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m26s)

[and from any related library yes so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m27s)

[the anything that you register in your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m31s)

[configure services is now available for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m34s)

[consumption](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m37s)

[so now that i've registered up my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m39s)

[imessenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m41s)

[if i put an imessenger in any objects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m42s)

[constructor that the di container goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m45s)

[to resolve it now knows how to do it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m47s)

[so it's it's very common in a big](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m49s)

[application to have you know a few](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m51s)

[hundred of these ad calls so maybe some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m53s)

[of them will be transient maybe some of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m56s)

[them will be singletons um depends on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h09m58s)

[what what the object is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m00s)

[but yeah any anything that you could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m03s)

[reference by a type name in c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m05s)

[you can put into your di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m08s)

[which is which is pretty powerful pretty](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m10s)

[quick um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m13s)

[it also means that when i go to test](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m17s)

[my main window view model i can now pass](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m18s)

[in um test doubles for it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m23s)

[and one other video i will call out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m24s)

[uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m28s)

[there is another one that i have called](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m32s)

[polishing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m36s)

[polishing your unit tests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m38s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m40s)

[there's this one here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m42s)

[uh nope back to the beginning this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m44s)

[another one so it's specifically if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m46s)

[you're getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m48s)

[into the idea of writing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m49s)

[tests um and structuring your objects in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m52s)

[this way such that they have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m54s)

[dependencies coming in through the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m56s)

[constructor i definitely take a look at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m57s)

[that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h10m59s)

[because when you get to writing tests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m01s)

[that can often quickly become a time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m03s)

[sync and it doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m05s)

[there are a lot of different ways of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m07s)

[providing those dependencies sort of in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m09s)

[an auto magical fashion which is cool](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m11s)

[um but there are trade-offs to all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m14s)

[the approaches in that video i kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m16s)

[go through](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m18s)

[um four basic approaches of just write](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m19s)

[it by hand use a library like uh mock or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m21s)

[mock you um use something like auto](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m24s)

[marker to make that process even faster](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m27s)

[and then go back to writing it by hand](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m29s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m31s)

[it goes full circle](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m32s)

[but i try to outline kind of the pros](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m34s)

[and cons of each i think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m36s)

[outside of the first approach the latter](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m38s)

[three there are use cases for each of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m40s)

[them where they make sense and it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m43s)

[important to understand their blind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m44s)

[spots](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m45s)

[because typically in an app i'll use](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m47s)

[some combination of all three](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m49s)

[typically there there's a few cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m53s)

[where you can get away with only doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m54s)

[the very last one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m56s)

[okay so uh let's look at simpler case so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h11m59s)

[in the case where we've got a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m06s)

[a factory where it really just is this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m08s)

[this sort of pattern because sometimes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m12s)

[your factories perhaps we want to have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m13s)

[factory that's even simpler](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m16s)

[right we could we could say you know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m18s)

[what maybe we want an overload of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m19s)

[that that doesn't take a string or maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m22s)

[we have one that takes an int or similar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m24s)

[right we could start making these these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m26s)

[factories](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m27s)

[fairly complex if we wanted to and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m28s)

[adding more functionality to them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m30s)

[but in the case where you really just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m32s)

[have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m33s)

[single interface a single create method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m36s)

[this feels a little overkill](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m38s)

[and it kind of is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m40s)

[so a simpler option is to abuse the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m42s)

[delegate type in c sharp so if we go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m45s)

[c sharp delegate uh theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m48s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m52s)

[we will call it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m55s)

[just call it create theme i think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h12m58s)

[and then string](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m00s)

[name in fact the auto code is hitting on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m02s)

[point for this it's really creepy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m05s)

[kind of love it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m10s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m13s)

[for those people who may not be familiar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m14s)

[with delegate types oftentimes in c](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m15s)

[sharp you don't need to declare your own](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m17s)

[delegate types](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m20s)

[this is something that was really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m22s)

[important back in ye olden days](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m24s)

[um especially when you were defining](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m26s)

[your own events and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m28s)

[nowadays most people just use funk and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m30s)

[action for almost everything unless](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m31s)

[you're doing things with like outer ref](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m33s)

[parameters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m35s)

[funk and action pretty much rule that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m37s)

[rule the day](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m41s)

[but the one thing that declaring a a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m42s)

[custom delegate gets you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m44s)

[is that allows you to put a name to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m47s)

[and so action and funk are great for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m50s)

[kind of smaller scoped things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m53s)

[but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m55s)

[you could use them in your di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m57s)

[but they lose a little bit of that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h13m59s)

[meanie because they they don't really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m01s)

[have names associated with them maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m02s)

[they're fine in your particular](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m04s)

[application](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m05s)

[i'll leave it up to you i i know one of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m06s)

[my colleagues says that he enjoys using](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m08s)

[funk for the trick i'm about to show you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m10s)

[but i think it really depends on context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m12s)

[so i prefer custom delegate because it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m15s)

[allows me to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m18s)

[uh to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m19s)

[put a name to it so in this case i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m20s)

[just saying hey i'm gonna have a method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m23s)

[it's gonna return a theme color it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m25s)

[going to take in a name and initial](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m27s)

[value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m28s)

[but the name of this this delegate is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m29s)

[create theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m31s)

[what we can do is we can come back over](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m33s)

[here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m35s)

[uh nope here and rather than doing theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m36s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m39s)

[but this is this is alternate technique](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m40s)

[um we can go add singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m43s)

[and we can register up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m47s)

[uh a create theme now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m49s)

[you'll note on all these other ad](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m52s)

[singleton calls i just specified the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m53s)

[type so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m56s)

[that will let the di container create it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h14m57s)

[when it's ready however maybe creating](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m00s)

[up one of these types requires a little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m03s)

[more know-how something that perhaps the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m05s)

[di container doesn't know about or maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m08s)

[you want to provide your own](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m10s)

[customization or whatever](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m11s)

[but inside of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m13s)

[add singleton method and any of the add](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m15s)

[ones you'll note there are overloads so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m17s)

[specifically this funk](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m19s)

[that allows you to to get an instance of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m21s)

[the service provider so this will get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m24s)

[invoked](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m25s)

[after your di container has already been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m26s)

[set up so this gets this callback gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m28s)

[invoked once the first time somebody](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m30s)

[asks for this thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m34s)

[we'll do service provider even though we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m36s)

[don't really need it and then we will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m38s)

[create a new create theme object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m40s)

[which is going to be which is going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m44s)

[be this guy here and then inside of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m45s)

[create so just like we were](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m47s)

[instantiating a normal delegate what we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m49s)

[would do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m51s)

[we will wrap this up with string](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m52s)

[name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m55s)

[uh string](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h15m57s)

[and knit value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m00s)

[and then we will do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m03s)

[new theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m06s)

[and so this will be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m08s)

[name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m10s)

[provider](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m13s)

[get required service](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m14s)

[i messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m18s)

[running out of horizontal space very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m20s)

[rapidly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m22s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m24s)

[value gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m27s)

[initial init value okay so let's let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m29s)

[break this onto multiple oh we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m31s)

[debugging that's part of why that's part](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m33s)

[of why this thing is is angry at me so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m35s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m37s)

[let's break this guy down into uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m38s)

[to its individual parts because this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m40s)

[this is big](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m45s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m48s)

[multiple white space white space to make](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m50s)

[code readable definitely white space to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m52s)

[make code readable so let's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m54s)

[i think we do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m57s)

[something like that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h16m59s)

[okay so what this is doing is it's it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m01s)

[adding a singleton for this delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m04s)

[type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m06s)

[and it's saying okay when when somebody](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m07s)

[needs this delegate type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m08s)

[here's the here's the instance that i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m11s)

[want you to use because i'm i'm creating](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m12s)

[a new instance of this delegate so this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m14s)

[is going to be that singleton instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m16s)

[um and it's going to take in the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m19s)

[when creating a delegate this is no](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m22s)

[different than than old school c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m24s)

[we just set it up like this with the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m26s)

[right signature so string or knit value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m29s)

[this could just as easily be pointed at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m31s)

[a method somewhere if i wanted to put it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m33s)

[there but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m35s)

[i'll do it in line here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m36s)

[um you'll note then this guy is doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m38s)

[the exact same work that our factory was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m40s)

[doing it passes the the name parameter](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m42s)

[into the name of the theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m45s)

[theme color constructor and then it uses](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m47s)

[provider get required service to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m49s)

[actually reach back into our di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m51s)

[container and say hang on i need that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m52s)

[imessenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m55s)

[pulls it back out and then assigns the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m56s)

[value](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h17m58s)

[and what we can do instead then is back](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m00s)

[in our main window view model rather](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m02s)

[than using this theme factory you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m03s)

[get rid of that guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m05s)

[and what we can do instead i'm just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m07s)

[going to comment this out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m09s)

[is we can go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m11s)

[create theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m14s)

[uh create theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m15s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m18s)

[we'll just we'll do that again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m20s)

[so once again i'm taking in a delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m23s)

[and then i can come down here and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m26s)

[rather than calling theme color factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m28s)

[create on the delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m30s)

[uh what is it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m33s)

[what i call it theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m35s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m40s)

[so then i just invoke it as i would any](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m50s)

[other method so just to be clear in case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m52s)

[people didn't get it catch it the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m54s)

[constructor brings it in assigns it to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m56s)

[this property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m58s)

[but because it's a delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h18m59s)

[it just holds on to that reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m01s)

[and then i can go through and invoke it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m05s)

[whenever i need it as th the same as i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m08s)

[was invoking the factory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m10s)

[um and actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m13s)

[i'm going to copy this and then undo](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m14s)

[undo](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m16s)

[undo](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m18s)

[i'll leave them all sitting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m24s)

[all right next to each other for the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m26s)

[moment just so that that it's clear the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m27s)

[the different methodologies here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m29s)

[so old school without di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m32s)

[me writing up a whole theme factory me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m35s)

[doing a custom delegate so oftentimes if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m37s)

[you have a factory pattern that you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m40s)

[implementing and the factory is simple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m42s)

[uh meaning that it's it's really just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m44s)

[one method there's not a lot going on in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m46s)

[there it's really just taking in some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m49s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m50s)

[munging it together and spitting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m51s)

[something back out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m52s)

[you can get away with a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m54s)

[using a delegate type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m57s)

[the nice part about the delegate type is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h19m59s)

[when it comes time for testing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m01s)

[unlike having it being like a concrete](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m04s)

[instance because that the delegate still](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m05s)

[has](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m08s)

[effectively its implementation that you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m09s)

[need to define inside of it because a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m11s)

[delegate just defines a signature](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m12s)

[right when i when i lay out this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m15s)

[delegate it's kind of like an interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m17s)

[in that all it's doing is laying out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m20s)

[one single method signature for me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m22s)

[just pretty much all this is doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m24s)

[so you can imagine this kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m28s)

[correlates to the interface name this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m29s)

[core](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m32s)

[uh or i'm sorry this correlates to the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m33s)

[return value this maps to the interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m34s)

[name and then this signature lays it out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m41s)

[not from new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m42s)

[new is glue we must hide all types over](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m43s)

[interfaces so yes i i like that phrase](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m45s)

[new as glue i've heard that a couple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m49s)

[times and that is that is exactly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m50s)

[correct new is tight coupling it glues](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m52s)

[your stuff together](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m56s)

[but in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m57s)

[the the delegate is being created via](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h20m59s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m02s)

[um from the container so specifically in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m02s)

[here so if you're asking can we do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m06s)

[something like uh services just add](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m08s)

[singleton of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m11s)

[create theme](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m13s)

[not quite because something ultimately](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m16s)

[is going to need to to know how to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m18s)

[create this and delegates aren't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m20s)

[something that have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m22s)

[i hate using the word default](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m25s)

[constructor but that's the best way to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m26s)

[describe it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m28s)

[there's not a way to just instantiate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m29s)

[them not giving them anything a delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m31s)

[is going to need to know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m34s)

[what to actually invoke because the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m36s)

[delegate is really just laying out the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m38s)

[signature ultimately what gets in vote](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m40s)

[will be either some other lambda or some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m43s)

[other method um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m46s)

[that ends up creating this so you could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m48s)

[end up rather than putting all of this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m51s)

[here you know maybe move this this bit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m52s)

[off into a static method somewhere if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m55s)

[that makes sense](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m57s)

[it's up to you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h21m58s)

[oftentimes i like doing them in line](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m00s)

[here because this is this is quick and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m02s)

[easy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m04s)

[and if i want to change things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m06s)

[and because you also have access to the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m08s)

[the service provider in this delegate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m11s)

[um it means that you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m13s)

[recursively kind of reach back into the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m15s)

[the di container and get out anything](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m17s)

[that you need so if there's something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m19s)

[else that your object might need like in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m21s)

[this case the imessenger we can kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m23s)

[reach in and do a little grab bag style](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m25s)

[of well i want the name here i want the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m27s)

[imessenger from here i want to grab my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m29s)

[init value and call a property center](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m31s)

[here and build that up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m35s)

[this is this works in the simplest of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m36s)

[use case however the simple use case is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m40s)

[far more common than the complicated](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m42s)

[case so i'll put it that way so it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m44s)

[worth keeping it uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m46s)

[it's worth noting that sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m48s)

[setup for the um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m53s)

[that sort of setup for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m58s)

[building out your objects and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h22m59s)

[structuring them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m00s)

[okay there's one more thing that i did](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m02s)

[really poorly that i would like to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m04s)

[address](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m07s)

[i'm going to leave this guy sitting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m09s)

[right i'm going to leave the theme color](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m11s)

[stuff sitting alongside just for for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m13s)

[it may be deleted in a future commit but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m16s)

[at least for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m18s)

[this uh must we hide all types over](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m20s)

[interfaces for example](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m23s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m25s)

[that is a great question that is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m26s)

[wonderful question](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m30s)

[must you no um and in fact i would](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m32s)

[actually encourage you not to hide it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m35s)

[behind an interface until you have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m38s)

[reason to do so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m42s)

[i think we'll get to starting to write](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m45s)

[tests tonight so we'll probably get into](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m46s)

[a little bit about that when i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m48s)

[teaching people about interfaces in c](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m50s)

[sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m52s)

[i usually warn people that interfaces um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m53s)

[are easy to write but hard to get right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h23m59s)

[they are very easy to declare you it is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m00s)

[anyone can write an interface that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m03s)

[very simple but making the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m05s)

[but making the interface correct](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m08s)

[meaning it has the right abstraction is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m10s)

[oftentimes more difficult and quite](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m12s)

[often i see people just blindly throwing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m14s)

[interfaces in and then copying and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m17s)

[pasting signatures around if you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m18s)

[doing that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m20s)

[stop back up for a minute and think um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m22s)

[because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m25s)

[i don't like the blind hiding things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m26s)

[behind interfaces](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m28s)

[oftentimes it's important to note doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m31s)

[it that way does](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m33s)

[decouple two classes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m35s)

[um but if you have a poorly designed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m37s)

[interface you may not have actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m39s)

[decoupled it as much as you think you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m41s)

[have so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m43s)

[i oftentimes tell people don't do it so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m44s)

[for example we don't have to hide things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m47s)

[behind interfaces for the di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m49s)

[to work so main window is an example of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m51s)

[that there's no interface going in it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m53s)

[a concrete class as long as the di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m56s)

[container knows how to create the thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h24m58s)

[you're good](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m01s)

[um it is worth noting too](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m05s)

[there is a concept of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m06s)

[the type that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m08s)

[the implementing type and the register](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m10s)

[type so for example if i were to have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m12s)

[constructor that took in a weak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m15s)

[reference messenger the di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m16s)

[would not know how to resolve that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m19s)

[because i've told it that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m21s)

[um you can almost think of the the first](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m24s)

[type as like if you were to look up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m26s)

[something in that wrestling recipe book](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m27s)

[and say an index or a glossary](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m29s)

[um weak reference manager is indexed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m31s)

[under imessenger so it only will resolve](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m34s)

[it if somebody asks for an imessenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m37s)

[if you ask for this specific type i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m39s)

[would end up having to to do um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m41s)

[i'd end up having to do something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m46s)

[this you could actually think of this as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m48s)

[uh or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m51s)

[that's the wrong one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m53s)

[you could actually think of this this uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m56s)

[single generic parameter as shorthand](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h25m58s)

[for having the double generic where the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m00s)

[the first one in the double generic is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m03s)

[the the register key of what it's what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m05s)

[it will be used to look up from and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m08s)

[this being the implementation if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m10s)

[have one it just uses the same value for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m12s)

[both](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m14s)

[great simple that's that's just nice](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m15s)

[convenient shorthand um but in this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m18s)

[situation this is one of those cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m20s)

[where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m22s)

[you would then want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m23s)

[you were passing in the same instance to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m24s)

[both of these because these are two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m26s)

[separate registrations](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m28s)

[so that's fun](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m32s)

[um this is another case where oftentimes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m34s)

[um i might do something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m41s)

[register like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m43s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m50s)

[do something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m52s)

[something like this for shorthand um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h26m59s)

[that way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m02s)

[both of these two registrations even](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m03s)

[though they're registered under separate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m05s)

[keys you can make again separate items](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m07s)

[in like a glossary or an index](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m09s)

[even though they're under two different](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m11s)

[listings](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m12s)

[they're both going to go back to the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m13s)

[same place rather than going back to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m14s)

[different instances so making sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m16s)

[if you do register something under](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m18s)

[multiple keys](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m20s)

[that you do it that way this can also](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m22s)

[happen if maybe a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m24s)

[single type implements multiple maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m25s)

[disparate interfaces](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m28s)

[and so you want to register it under two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m30s)

[different interfaces so that people you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m32s)

[know if they have re so i may end up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m33s)

[getting this messenger if i ask for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m36s)

[imessenger but i also may end up getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m38s)

[it if i ask for you know like my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m40s)

[sender or similar because i think i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m43s)

[messenger i think i messenger is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m44s)

[composite anyway](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m49s)

[uh what do you think about property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m52s)

[field injection or same stuff some di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m54s)

[libraries provide those functionalities](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m56s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m57s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h27m58s)

[i think it depends they they serve a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m04s)

[purpose um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m08s)

[confession time i've actually written my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m09s)

[own di library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m11s)

[that that does support](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m13s)

[property injection as well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m15s)

[so there there are definitely use cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m18s)

[where where it is nice effectively](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m21s)

[property injection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m23s)

[um from the di containers perspective](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m25s)

[isn't that different than this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m28s)

[like from the from the outside](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m34s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m35s)

[all it does is instantiate the object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m37s)

[and then call the appropriate setters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m39s)

[for you which is great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m43s)

[i i don't necessarily have a problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m45s)

[with it the only thing to keep in mind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m47s)

[is oftentimes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m49s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m52s)

[your your there's sort of an implicit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m53s)

[coupling there the moment you start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m55s)

[using those those types of features](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m56s)

[because if you were to ever move away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h28m59s)

[from that di container to a different](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m01s)

[one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m02s)

[and the new di container didn't support](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m04s)

[that same stuff you now run into a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m06s)

[problem where parts of your app may be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m08s)

[broken in very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m10s)

[non-obvious ways because something that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m12s)

[was previously magically handled for you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m15s)

[is no longer magically handled](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m17s)

[but practically you don't usually change](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m19s)

[out your di container that often i mean](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m21s)

[i've been on apps where it's changed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m24s)

[once maybe twice](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m26s)

[over the light over years so it's not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m28s)

[exactly a common thing that happens very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m31s)

[often](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m32s)

[and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m34s)

[anytime you do it you're kind of ripping](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m35s)

[out a foundational piece anyway there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m36s)

[oftentimes a lot of testing that goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m38s)

[into making sure that things are still](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m40s)

[working](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m42s)

[uh anyway](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m43s)

[so i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m44s)

[yeah i don't necessarily have a problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m46s)

[with it the only thing i would say is if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m48s)

[you're using it make sure it's obvious](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m50s)

[to the the programmers on the team that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m52s)

[that is a thing at play because some di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m55s)

[containers it just works by magic and it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h29m57s)

[can be very counter intuitive to a new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m01s)

[developer on the team that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m02s)

[how did this property get assigned it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m05s)

[just poof showed up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m08s)

[i say that and i'm also very guilty of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m10s)

[it my di library um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m12s)

[does il manipulation to make magic occur](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m15s)

[so that said i'm definitely on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m18s)

[guilty side of that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m21s)

[but yeah i i have no no problem with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m23s)

[some of those things that the that the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m25s)

[third-party di libraries provide](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m27s)

[there is often good use cases for them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m30s)

[too like microsoft for their one they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m32s)

[were like performance is our top](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m34s)

[priority everything else can come in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m36s)

[second](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m38s)

[so they made theirs really fast](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m39s)

[at the cost of features and other people](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m42s)

[like but i want the features](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m43s)

[okay sure you pick which one makes the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m45s)

[most sense for for what you're doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m48s)

[startup time on a wpf app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m50s)

[is not overly significant especially if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m53s)

[you've already got some startup work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m55s)

[that's happening maybe you're popping a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m56s)

[splash screen already adding you know a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h30m58s)

[half a second not a big deal](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m00s)

[and away you go so maybe it matters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m04s)

[maybe it doesn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m06s)

[like a command line app startup time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m08s)

[really significant](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m10s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m17s)

[okay so the other thing that i that i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m20s)

[had broken is i did something bad here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m22s)

[this knack bar message queue and this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m25s)

[this works by accident now so if we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m28s)

[start this up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m30s)

[so what what is not obvious](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m38s)

[from just this code here and i'll pull](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m41s)

[it open and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m44s)

[show so so this now works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m46s)

[magically um and it and again it works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m50s)

[kind of by accident it fell apart when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m53s)

[we had this code in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m55s)

[because this parallel for each this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h31m57s)

[delegate was going to get invoked on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m00s)

[background threads](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m01s)

[but now the only place where main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m03s)

[view model is actually being created](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m05s)

[is on a an sta thread so it works and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m07s)

[the reason it's problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m11s)

[is because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m13s)

[if we look at this snack bar message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m15s)

[view i only know this because this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m17s)

[coming from the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m18s)

[material design library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m21s)

[so this guy down here is where is it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m23s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m29s)

[he's looking for a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m30s)

[and ultimately](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m32s)

[to get a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m34s)

[it's looking at the current thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m36s)

[so it's got this helpful constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m40s)

[which is great it lets me instantiate it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m42s)

[inside my view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m44s)

[but it's only going to work if my view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m45s)

[model is created from a ui thread which](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m48s)

[isn't great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m50s)

[is it isn't great at all so but you'll](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m52s)

[note it very helpfully has this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m54s)

[this guy right here right so this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h32m57s)

[convenient it has a snack bar message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m00s)

[queue so let's come back here and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m02s)

[let's let's change this guy up a little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m06s)

[bit so rather than this being a hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m08s)

[instance we're gonna we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m10s)

[we're gonna we're gonna use the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m13s)

[interface instead because i'm pretty](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m14s)

[sure the interface is fairly thin](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m15s)

[yeah it's just got a bunch of nq methods](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m19s)

[we could actually even make the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m21s)

[interface thinner with extension methods](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m22s)

[but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m24s)

[we'll add that to my back one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m25s)

[um but let's come down here so now we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m27s)

[gonna go here and i'm gonna put it up at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m29s)

[the beginning](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m31s)

[because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m32s)

[uh snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m34s)

[okay we'll do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m41s)

[auto code can you figure it out oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m43s)

[nope can't figure it out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m46s)

[we'll go with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m48s)

[uh what was it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m50s)

[oh it did find the right one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m55s)

[i just thought it got the wrong one oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m57s)

[okay i'm sorry intellisense i didn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h33m59s)

[realize you were smarter than me okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m00s)

[okay and there's this guy here now in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m06s)

[this case this snack bar message queue](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m08s)

[this is something that i would not want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m11s)

[to necessarily register as a singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m12s)

[because this queue is expected to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m15s)

[support a single snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m17s)

[so in this case especially if somebody](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m20s)

[else in the app decided they wanted a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m22s)

[snack bar control it for the material](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m24s)

[design library that's just a little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m26s)

[message that pops up at the bottom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m27s)

[in this case i'm just using it for when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m29s)

[errors occur as a way of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m30s)

[i don't like the intrusive dialogue for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m32s)

[errors i find those obnoxious](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m35s)

[but in this case it's still you want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m37s)

[notify of problems](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m39s)

[so we will we will go that route](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m41s)

[so that means down here on my services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m43s)

[what i what i want to end up doing is i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m46s)

[want to do a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m48s)

[services ad](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m49s)

[transient](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m51s)

[uh and i want stack bar message queue](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m53s)

[and i think what we're going to do here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m57s)

[is we're going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h34m59s)

[we'll include the wpf library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m04s)

[we will go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m05s)

[i don't even think we need a full fledge](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m07s)

[provider so we're just gonna underscore](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m10s)

[and discard that guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m12s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m15s)

[navbar grabs the synchronization context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m16s)

[of the main app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m19s)

[this allows the components to interact](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m21s)

[yeah so this is one of those areas where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m23s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m26s)

[it's not a great design in the material](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m28s)

[design library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m30s)

[the the snack bar message queue](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m31s)

[is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m34s)

[it requires because it's going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m35s)

[directly interact with the the snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m37s)

[specifically rather than having the ui](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m40s)

[respond to events from it it actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m43s)

[deals with the the timing of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m46s)

[okay when do i pop the next message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m48s)

[because there has to be some sort of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m50s)

[waiting like if you queue up a bunch of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m52s)

[messages](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m54s)

[in material design you expect the first](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m55s)

[message to come up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m57s)

[wait for a little bit because the user](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h35m58s)

[might interact with or move their cursor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m00s)

[over it or click on it so it needs to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m01s)

[able to pause and wait if that happens](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m03s)

[and then dismiss and bring in the next](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m06s)

[one and then there's extra functionality](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m08s)

[built in there about okay if i queue up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m10s)

[the same message three times](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m11s)

[do we do we show it three times do we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m14s)

[consider those duplicates and dedupe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m16s)

[that as things go in so it's got all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m18s)

[that kind of functionality in there so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m19s)

[the only reason it's grabbing that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m21s)

[synchronization context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m23s)

[is because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m25s)

[the implementation in the material](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m27s)

[design library like it's an interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m29s)

[but it's an interface that's really only](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m30s)

[expected to get the material designed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m32s)

[one if you're in a real app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m34s)

[because the real one is going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m36s)

[interaction with the control directly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m38s)

[um expecting to be able to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m43s)

[to use it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m44s)

[so what we are going to come down here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m46s)

[and do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m49s)

[is let's see we're inside of a static](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m50s)

[yeah so let's do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m53s)

[how do we want to get a dispatcher back](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m56s)

[out because ultimately what i'd like to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h36m58s)

[do is i would like to grab a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m01s)

[so let's we'll write it this way uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m03s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m05s)

[uh dispatcher so we'll just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m08s)

[we'll just pretend like we got one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m11s)

[and then what we're gonna do is we will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m14s)

[do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m16s)

[a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m17s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m18s)

[uh invoke](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m20s)

[and then we will do new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m25s)

[knack bar message queue](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m27s)

[so you want to be careful with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m33s)

[dispatcher calls in your di container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m36s)

[like this especially with transient](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m37s)

[things because that could i could bite](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m39s)

[you that could be bad](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m40s)

[but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m45s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m46s)

[most of the time you you should be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m47s)

[you should be just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m50s)

[you should be just fine in this case as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m52s)

[long as your constructor is cheap and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m53s)

[light which this one is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m56s)

[just because this guy needs it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h37m58s)

[and i think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m00s)

[we're going to be explicit about the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m04s)

[time span because if we're going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m05s)

[retrieve the dispatcher i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m07s)

[i think what we're going to do we can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m09s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m11s)

[actually we we don't even need oh we can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m13s)

[we can be more clever we can be more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m15s)

[clever we don't need to do dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m17s)

[invoke here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m18s)

[that's better let's let's do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m20s)

[let's do this because the only reason](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m23s)

[it's it's needing to to go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m25s)

[after that synchronization context is to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m27s)

[get the dispatcher but if i already have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m29s)

[an instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m31s)

[let's just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m32s)

[pass it in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m34s)

[uh time span from seconds](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m35s)

[was it was 0.3 the default](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m39s)

[three seconds it's the default](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m42s)

[i guess that makes sense](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m46s)

[gotta give users time to read okay and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m48s)

[so here what i think i'm going to do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m50s)

[i am actually going to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m52s)

[let's let's retrieve this provider](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h38m55s)

[provider](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m01s)

[get required service and we are going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m03s)

[pull back the dispatcher out of it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m05s)

[now currently nothing's actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m09s)

[registered the dispatcher so when this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m11s)

[callback gets invoked this is going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m12s)

[throw so we need to fix that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m14s)

[so let's go with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m16s)

[services](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m19s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m20s)

[singleton](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m24s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m27s)

[but in this case the way we want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m28s)

[actually get this is going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m34s)

[application.current.dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m35s)

[we'll just retrieve it that way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m39s)

[uh simplify member](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m42s)

[all right because i'm inside of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m44s)

[application](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m48s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m49s)

[i understand that i can omit the generic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m50s)

[parameter but this is not clear to me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m53s)

[we're leaving that there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m56s)

[we're leaving that there so now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h39m59s)

[i should be able to recreate my main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m03s)

[window view model because my main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m04s)

[view model needs this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m07s)

[snack bar message queue this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m08s)

[needs the dispatcher dispatcher is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m10s)

[registered here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m12s)

[okay so that should work and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m14s)

[let's go down here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m18s)

[do you do leak code](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m23s)

[i have in the past but it has been a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m24s)

[very long time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m32s)

[can we rule the dispatcher in regular](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m35s)

[tasks or control the dispatch priority](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m37s)

[to allow him](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m38s)

[uh to manage to all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m40s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m43s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m48s)

[you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m51s)

[um i i i'm pausing on that because i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m53s)

[don't the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m57s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h40m58s)

[i don't think that's actually the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m02s)

[structure you want um let's get to doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m03s)

[the task.run case um and i think that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m06s)

[will probably show a cleaner approach to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m08s)

[handling that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m11s)

[so but let's make sure our snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m13s)

[message stuff still works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m19s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m23s)

[we launch i just realized that even](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m24s)

[though i launched we haven't done it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m29s)

[milo uh uh was there something specific](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m32s)

[about lead code that you were interested](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m34s)

[in or just looking for uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m36s)

[people who do it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m41s)

[let's come in here i want to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m42s)

[i want to just validate](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m45s)

[did i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m49s)

[oh no i did validate i could have gotten](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m50s)

[enough so it did resolve my instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m51s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m53s)

[okay so let's let's talk about this task](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m56s)

[run because i assume this is part of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h41m58s)

[what the question comes to is there is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m00s)

[there's oftentimes this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m03s)

[this struggle](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m06s)

[inside of wpf related stuff because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m07s)

[there is a a rule with almost all ui](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m10s)

[frameworks](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m13s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m15s)

[that says only the ui thread can touch](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m16s)

[not a good day](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m26s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m28s)

[we've registered the dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m29s)

[inside uh inside of our di container so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m32s)

[there's nothing stopping us from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m34s)

[accepting it as a constructor parameter](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m36s)

[that's a thing we could do the reason](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m38s)

[i'm hesitant to do so is the dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m41s)

[i will often classify as a ui class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m43s)

[um and there's a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m47s)

[in general you don't want to get your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m49s)

[your ui classes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h42m51s)

[below the ui itself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m00s)

[the climbing stair problems i know it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m03s)

[easy i i just can't understand the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m05s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m07s)

[i will admit i am not familiar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m12s)

[see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m16s)

[i assume this is what you're referring](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m25s)

[to so slight detour and i'm welcome by](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m27s)

[the way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m30s)

[um you're climbing a staircase it takes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m31s)

[n steps to reach the top](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m33s)

[each time you can climb either one or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m35s)

[two steps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m37s)

[and how many distinct ways can you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m38s)

[oh this is the game](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m41s)

[what's the name of it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m44s)

[oh i've seen it because i've seen this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m48s)

[i've seen this problem worded in a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m50s)

[different way where you and an uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m52s)

[opponent are pulling matchsticks out of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m54s)

[a pile and you can pull](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m56s)

[either one or two and you need to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h43m58s)

[to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m00s)

[and you don't want to be the guy who](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m01s)

[picks up the last one so there's a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m02s)

[there's a similar algorithm that seems](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m04s)

[that immediately jumps out to me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m09s)

[it's got a short name pin](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m10s)

[min](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m12s)

[oh man i'm blanking on that name um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m14s)

[you can either climb one or two steps in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m18s)

[how many distinct ways can you climb to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m20s)

[the top](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m22s)

[uh so if n equals two the output is two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m23s)

[because you can either go up one step at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m26s)

[a time or just jump both steps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m28s)

[got it okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m39s)

[i know it's easy i just can't understand](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m43s)

[the solution so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m44s)

[in this case it's asking for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m48s)

[um identifying the count of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m52s)

[permutations so how many how many](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m53s)

[different solutions are there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h44m57s)

[trying to think of an easy way of of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m01s)

[putting this down so in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m03s)

[there's there's kind of a cheater way to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m10s)

[do this with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m12s)

[binary but it doesn't expand out very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m14s)

[nicely but so in it rather than doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m16s)

[one or two you could count it as zero or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m18s)

[one and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m20s)

[you can kind of quickly find your way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m21s)

[through](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m24s)

[in that case because you can start to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m26s)

[you can start to see the count out of of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m28s)

[how this is going to end up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m32s)

[because whatever n is the very first](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m35s)

[solution will be always just go one step](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m37s)

[at a time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m39s)

[one one one all the way up so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m40s)

[n of 45 the very first solution will be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m42s)

[jump 45 times and then do it um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m46s)

[with the next solution being go two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m50s)

[steps at a time then one one one one one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m52s)

[one all the way up to 45](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m54s)

[and then you can shift that two over one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m56s)

[do one step two steps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h45m59s)

[then a bunch of ones again um and so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m01s)

[it's you start to get a pattern that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m04s)

[very much almost looks like um if you've](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m06s)

[seen like the binary clocks where you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m08s)

[see the counting which is why i say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m10s)

[because they're because they're the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m12s)

[the limits on how many you can take are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m14s)

[only two values one or zero you could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m17s)

[you could almost do it in the same way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m20s)

[that a binary clock counts](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m22s)

[and count up from there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m26s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m30s)

[does that does that help](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m34s)

[i i don't know if that that's familiar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m39s)

[i'd be curious to know um what your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m41s)

[background is if when i say counting in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m44s)

[binary if that makes if that makes sense](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m46s)

[to you or not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m48s)

[uh i'm kind of getting it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m55s)

[here i'll](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m57s)

[we'll write out just a couple of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h46m58s)

[of conceptually how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m00s)

[and again i i suspect there's multiple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m02s)

[ways to solve this problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m05s)

[and this is just the first one that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m07s)

[comes to my mind so other people can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m09s)

[have different ways of doing it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m11s)

[so picking on their](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m13s)

[their built-in sample and by the way i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m15s)

[definitely don't mind getting distracted](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m18s)

[with questions so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m20s)

[um circle back to the di stuff in just a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m22s)

[minute](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m24s)

[so if we pick on n equals three](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m25s)

[and one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m28s)

[step will equal zero](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m30s)

[two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m32s)

[uh steps will equal one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m33s)

[so where n is three the solution is zero](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m36s)

[zero zero](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m39s)

[the solution is zero uh what have they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m41s)

[got zero one zero](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m44s)

[and one zero](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m46s)

[because for each of these things you end](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m48s)

[up um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m50s)

[so i guess we could rather than rather](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m53s)

[than doing this in binary](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m55s)

[we can actually think of it like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m57s)

[one one one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h47m58s)

[uh one two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m00s)

[uh two one and the the result is that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m02s)

[all of these things sum together must](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m05s)

[equal three](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m07s)

[right so if we if we go up one more](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m09s)

[beyond what they what they have there so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m12s)

[four it would be one one one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m14s)

[uh one two one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m16s)

[uh one one two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m19s)

[oh i missed one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m22s)

[two one one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m24s)

[uh let's see and then we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m27s)

[and then we increment one more time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m30s)

[right because those that that adds to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m33s)

[four that adds to four that adds to four](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m34s)

[and then two two i believe is the next](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m36s)

[one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m38s)

[i believe for n equals 4 that's the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m44s)

[total number of solutions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m47s)

[so in terms of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m49s)

[if i was to write code to do this this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m52s)

[starts to look](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m54s)

[to me like a recursive algorithm a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m55s)

[little bit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m57s)

[where you start with all ones](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h48m58s)

[then you add in a two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m01s)

[work it forward](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m04s)

[add in two twos work it forward and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m06s)

[actually let's go n equals five just so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m08s)

[that we can see the process of adding](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m10s)

[the second two and working it forward](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m12s)

[right so we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m14s)

[we start here so it's gonna be one one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m15s)

[one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m19s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m20s)

[this one then becomes that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m23s)

[so you can kind of start to see the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m26s)

[pattern as we bring in a two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m28s)

[it it kind of walks all the way down the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m29s)

[line](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m32s)

[then we bring in a second two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m33s)

[and then this goes two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m36s)

[one two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m39s)

[uh right and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m43s)

[one two two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m46s)

[i believe that's all of them there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m50s)

[so and the the interesting part about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m56s)

[this algorithm is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m57s)

[unlike a lot of normal counting where um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h49m59s)

[like in base 10 if you're just going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m03s)

[count up to 100 you know that you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m04s)

[only going to have those two digits up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m07s)

[through 99 whereas this because the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m08s)

[the total is shifting you're losing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m11s)

[digits basically as you're as you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m14s)

[counting out the solutions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m16s)

[so oftentimes on some of these i like to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m19s)

[go through and just do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m21s)

[start doing out the the smaller numbers](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m23s)

[that i can brute force](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m25s)

[because unfortunately with like n2 and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m28s)

[n3](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m30s)

[they're fine examples to explain the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m32s)

[problem but i think you have to go out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m34s)

[to four or five maybe six before you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m36s)

[start actually seeing the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m38s)

[the pattern to it because once you start](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m41s)

[once i start seeing this pattern i can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m44s)

[now start imagining what my um what my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m46s)

[for loop is gonna end up looking like to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m48s)

[kind of do this or what my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m51s)

[recursive function might look like in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m54s)

[order to go through and do this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m56s)

[summation](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m57s)

[so hopefully that helps](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h50m59s)

[hopefully that helps a little bit](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m04s)

[okay task run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m08s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m10s)

[um static methods are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m12s)

[pain in the neck oh thank you for the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m14s)

[follow i appreciate it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m18s)

[specifically with di um statics are a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m20s)

[huge pain](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m25s)

[but there are a few statics that are in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m27s)

[uh and put an interface to another](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m30s)

[library to allow us to untie the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m32s)

[consumer to get only an interface yes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m33s)

[yes yes yes yes yes i will sh let me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m35s)

[show that with the dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m42s)

[yeah i'll show a quick implementation on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m45s)

[the dispatcher um public](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m46s)

[interface and i've seen this written a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m49s)

[number of times](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m52s)

[right and so you could have something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m53s)

[like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m55s)

[what is it what is the invoke signature](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m56s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h51m59s)

[invoke right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m00s)

[so it's just void action so we could do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m03s)

[void](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m07s)

[invoke](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m08s)

[taking an action](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m09s)

[action](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m12s)

[right and the the only drawback is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m13s)

[um we can't put our own interface on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m16s)

[dit on the actual wpf dispatcher class](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m19s)

[so what we end up doing is usually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m22s)

[wrapping it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m24s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m27s)

[no no](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m29s)

[so this guy ends up being](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m30s)

[public](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m32s)

[class my](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m34s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m36s)

[and then usually you do something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m38s)

[so this class exists simply for for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m41s)

[store and forward it's literally all he](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m44s)

[does](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m46s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m47s)

[right and then this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m49s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m51s)

[i dispatcher not disposable those are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m53s)

[different implement interface and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m56s)

[this guy literally just forwards on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h52m58s)

[right and you can you can imagine a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m03s)

[you can imagine a similar pattern being](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m07s)

[applied to any number of things that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m09s)

[could be in disparate libraries that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m10s)

[kind of thing it's actually not uncommon](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m12s)

[to do this especially on libraries that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m14s)

[have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m16s)

[some class that you'd like to register](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m18s)

[in your di container but there's it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m19s)

[doesn't have a reasonable interface or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m22s)

[their interface sucks and you want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m24s)

[clean it up or similar right like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m25s)

[kind of pattern has its use cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m28s)

[um and you can certainly do this and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m31s)

[i've seen people register it and then](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m33s)

[your your view model takes in an eye](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m34s)

[dispatcher and it's got access](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m36s)

[everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m40s)

[the one thing i hate about this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m43s)

[and this this applies in a lot of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m45s)

[different situations this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m46s)

[my comment earlier about interfaces are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m49s)

[easy to write but hard to get right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m51s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m55s)

[a general architecture pattern called a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m56s)

[leaky abstraction and what it means is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h53m59s)

[oftentimes your interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m02s)

[leaks out the details of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m04s)

[implementing class behind it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m06s)

[in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m09s)

[it's not horrible because it's only it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m11s)

[only leaking this out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m13s)

[but usually the moment you start to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m17s)

[write a second](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m20s)

[implementation of an interface that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m21s)

[usually starts to tease out those those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m23s)

[bad abstractions because if you if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m26s)

[have to put a method on an interface and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m28s)

[then only implement it in one or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m30s)

[or only in some of your implementing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m33s)

[classes that's probably an indication](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m35s)

[that your interface abstraction is wrong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m38s)

[because once you start getting those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m41s)

[tight couplings of well it'll this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m43s)

[method only really applies to this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m45s)

[implementation it's like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m49s)

[but if you're exposing that out of your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m50s)

[interface you're saying all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m52s)

[implementation should match that and so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m53s)

[you start to get into that that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m55s)

[situation which is another reason why](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m56s)

[writing tests over your classes um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h54m59s)

[really start to help tease out those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m02s)

[things um it's also a great reason why](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m04s)

[on that uh testing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m10s)

[video i posted earlier](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m11s)

[why](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m12s)

[the the last step that i advocate for is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m14s)

[writing your own implementation of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m16s)

[interface as a simulator because by the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m18s)

[time you've done that you've probably](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m20s)

[teased out a lot of those potentially](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m22s)

[bad abstractions](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m25s)

[um and that's the only thing i don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m27s)

[like about idispatcher is it tends to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m29s)

[a leaky abstraction](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m32s)

[with that said i'm pretty sure i've](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m34s)

[added this exact interface to multiple](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m36s)

[projects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m40s)

[if you can get away without having your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m41s)

[code depend on the dispatcher that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m43s)

[preferable so ways to avoid it depending](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m45s)

[on the dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m49s)

[do i have a good example buried in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m56s)

[i don't know if i do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h55m58s)

[so for example if the the other way we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m00s)

[could have handled the snack bar message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m03s)

[cube since this is a ui object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m05s)

[is this thing is only being used inside](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m08s)

[of the view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m10s)

[for um showing error messages](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m19s)

[so you'll know when it goes to show an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m20s)

[error](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m21s)

[all it's doing is putting a message on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m23s)

[that message cube](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m24s)

[and let's assume that the snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m26s)

[message queue didn't have an interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m28s)

[on it that we could that we could use we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m30s)

[could wrap it up and put our own](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m31s)

[interface on it that that is one option](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m33s)

[another option would be to actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m36s)

[leverage that uh the messenger the pub](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m38s)

[sub model to decouple those things um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m41s)

[apart so rather than having show air](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m44s)

[um directly at it do something like uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m47s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m51s)

[send](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m52s)

[a new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m54s)

[this is total pseudo code so show air](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h56m56s)

[message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m00s)

[message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m02s)

[message stop helping me details](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m05s)

[so we could have it just post a message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m09s)

[and then in our code behind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m11s)

[create our snack bar message queue here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m14s)

[and there's no reason this guy couldn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m16s)

[also be a recipient for that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m18s)

[message](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m21s)

[and have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m22s)

[the the ui object say oh okay when you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m23s)

[want to share one error message what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m26s)

[that means is i put it on to the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m28s)

[snack bar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m31s)

[great now all of the code that's using](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m32s)

[ui objects lives in the ui or hey i need](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m35s)

[to make sure that because i'm touching a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m39s)

[ui object when i receive a message i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m41s)

[should probably make sure that's invoked](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m43s)

[on the dispatcher and so oftentimes what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m45s)

[i'll try to do is rather than getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m47s)

[the dispatcher down inside of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m50s)

[view models or service code to get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m52s)

[access to have them use the dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m54s)

[my preference is usually to have those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h57m57s)

[those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m00s)

[objects post messages or similar out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m01s)

[and let the handler then decide](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m05s)

[oh does this need to be on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m07s)

[dispatcher or not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m09s)

[because the other thing that oftentimes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m11s)

[happens is if you do like dispatch or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m12s)

[invoke](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m14s)

[you're making the assumption that the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m16s)

[the code in your view model now knows](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m18s)

[something about your view because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m20s)

[anything that you put in that dispatcher](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m22s)

[invoke](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m24s)

[inherently what you're saying is i know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m25s)

[this has to be on a ui thread](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m27s)

[well by having that if you have that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m30s)

[knowledge about a ui thread down inside](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m32s)

[your view model you've kind of exposed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m34s)

[a little bit of coupling there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m38s)

[implicitly by having that knowledge so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m39s)

[again i usually try to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m42s)

[keep the dispatcher as as close to just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m44s)

[being in my view objects as i can get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m48s)

[that's that's that's my preference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m51s)

[and i i don't doubt that that people can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m53s)

[probably find use cases where just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m56s)

[passing it down makes more sense](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h58m58s)

[i would totally believe that those cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m01s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m02s)

[but i would also look to to restructure](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m04s)

[first that wouldn't be my go-to solution](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m06s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m09s)

[okay and a similar thing actually can be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m10s)

[applied to this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m13s)

[this task run so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m15s)

[and here what we've got is we've got](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m17s)

[this this load themes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m19s)

[problem here and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m21s)

[what we want to have happen is when the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m23s)

[window is shown](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m25s)

[we would like to actually kick off](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m26s)

[loading the themes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m29s)

[and so one very easy way to handle this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m34s)

[we're gonna get rid of that uh if we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m36s)

[have a multi-library app we need to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m39s)

[more careful about types without](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m41s)

[interfaces coupling one library can get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m42s)

[unnecessary references](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m47s)

[typically that doesn't end up being too](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m51s)

[big of an issue](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m54s)

[um you so you always have to be careful](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m56s)

[about coupling so that is that is always](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=01h59m59s)

[something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m02s)

[to to be conscious of um usually the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m03s)

[the easy way to work around it is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m07s)

[if you see the number of things in your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m11s)

[constructor getting big start looking](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m13s)

[for ways of refactoring your objects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m15s)

[view models are no different than any](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m17s)

[other c sharp object all the general](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m19s)

[good practices about hey try to keep](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m21s)

[your method small try to keep your the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m23s)

[number of your dependencies small all of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m25s)

[those things because smaller code is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m28s)

[usually simpler code easier to read](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m30s)

[easier to refactor maintain et cetera](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m32s)

[again those are guidelines not hard fast](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m34s)

[rules](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m36s)

[um all of those things apply](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m37s)

[in the multi-library approach i don't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m40s)

[think it changes too much](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m42s)

[you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m44s)

[you usually don't end up with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m45s)

[unnecessary references um but you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m47s)

[accidentally add coupling where where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m51s)

[you don't expect](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m53s)

[i highly recommend](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m56s)

[unit tests](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h00m59s)

[because unit tests typically tease out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m01s)

[where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m03s)

[where you've got coupling if you're if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m04s)

[you go to start writing a test over a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m06s)

[an object like this main window view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m10s)

[model and it's hard](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m11s)

[evaluate why it's hard because you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m14s)

[probably that's probably starting to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m16s)

[hint at a structural problem of coupling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m18s)

[or similar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m21s)

[should we strive for module applications](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m23s)

[where the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m24s)

[modules don't know each other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m27s)

[i will answer that abstractly yes ish](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m34s)

[that is that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m34s)

[good on paper and oftentimes what i try](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m37s)

[to do so if it is possible to have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m40s)

[things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m42s)

[i i will say this you should try to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m44s)

[reduce the amount of coupling you have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m46s)

[um the other one is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m48s)

[that you'll hear people talk about with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m50s)

[coupling is cohesion](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m51s)

[so the the golden standard is low](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m53s)

[coupling high cohesion](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m56s)

[so if it is reasonably possible to break](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h01m58s)

[things apart do so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m01s)

[but there is an extreme to that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m06s)

[so even though that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m08s)

[good](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m09s)

[and i think i like the word strive there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m11s)

[it is a good thing to strive for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m13s)

[but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m16s)

[there are there comes points where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m18s)

[you shouldn't it becomes overbuilt um at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m21s)

[a at a certain point so because you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m24s)

[you can refactor and decouple and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m27s)

[oftentimes decoupling is great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m29s)

[but with all of those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m32s)

[abstraction layers](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m34s)

[you can oftentimes make your code worse](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m36s)

[because now it becomes really difficult](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m39s)

[to work with](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m42s)

[there is an extreme and i would say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m43s)

[don't push it don't push it all the way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m45s)

[um again i like tests for for handling](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m47s)

[that because they they start to tease](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m51s)

[out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m53s)

[where where those layers should be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m53s)

[um okay i'm gonna deal with this task](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m56s)

[run real quick so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h02m58s)

[this guy is pretty easy because in this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m00s)

[case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m03s)

[i'm just going to make this guy public](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m04s)

[because i have no problem with this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m08s)

[being public or actually i don't even](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m09s)

[need to make him public](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m11s)

[because he gets invoked from the refresh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m13s)

[command](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m14s)

[and the refresh command is public so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m16s)

[here's what i'm going to do i'm just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m17s)

[going to get rid of task.run out of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m19s)

[constructor that just goes away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m21s)

[and then i'm going to go into my main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m23s)

[window because ultimately what we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m25s)

[saying is we would like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m26s)

[the the themes loaded when the window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m29s)

[launches](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m32s)

[so i'm just going to go down here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m33s)

[register up a loaded event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m36s)

[so when the main window is loaded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m40s)

[we're just gonna go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m43s)

[view model dot refresh command](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m49s)

[execute](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m51s)

[yeah i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m54s)

[i like that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m56s)

[i like that a lot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h03m58s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m03s)

[uh oh and it wants a parameter but that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m06s)

[command doesn't take any parameters](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m09s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m11s)

[we're going to do that and that should](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m12s)

[get rid of that ugly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m16s)

[ugly bit of stuff in our constructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m18s)

[let's first make sure our app still](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m36s)

[launches and works](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m37s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m40s)

[so it's still loaded everything up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m41s)

[that's great](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m44s)

[what we might do here as well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m50s)

[uh i won't worry about it i won't worry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m53s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m55s)

[should we unsubscribe from events like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m56s)

[loading button click can gc clear](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h04m59s)

[unsubscribed objects oh that is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m01s)

[wonderful question](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m03s)

[wonderful question so that is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m04s)

[specifically tied back to this loaded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m06s)

[event so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m08s)

[um this is one of the best and worst](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m09s)

[things about c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m11s)

[latest versions of c sharp they have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m12s)

[moved towards making the code easy to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m14s)

[write and so often times they um latest](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m17s)

[versions of c sharp hide away a lot of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m20s)

[the ceremony so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m24s)

[the i'm gonna write out what is actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m26s)

[happening here rounded event handler](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m33s)

[so when you type plus equals on the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m36s)

[event what it's actually doing is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m38s)

[instantiating a new delegate type](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m40s)

[um and pointing it at a method not that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m42s)

[uncommon to what we did when we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m45s)

[created a delegate here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m50s)

[in this case what is happening is the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m52s)

[main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m54s)

[is getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m56s)

[its loaded event is getting registered](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m58s)

[to a method here and what is subtly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h05m59s)

[happening](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m02s)

[is this is because this is an instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m03s)

[method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m05s)

[this is capturing the this variable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m09s)

[this uh event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m10s)

[will have a reference to um this method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m13s)

[as well as holding on to a reference of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m18s)

[main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m20s)

[now in this case we're fine](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m21s)

[simply because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m26s)

[it means main window is holding a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m27s)

[reference to itself and the garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m28s)

[collector in c-sharp is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m30s)

[top notch it is amazing um highly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m33s)

[performant](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m36s)

[but it doesn't mean you can't do really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m37s)

[bad things with memory and uh event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m39s)

[handlers when people have memory leaks](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m42s)

[they tend to be a big culprit so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m44s)

[knowing that when you do plus equals](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m47s)

[like this that it is implicitly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m49s)

[capturing the the this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m52s)

[the reference to your current object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m55s)

[that's really really important](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h06m57s)

[one of my colleagues actually made a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m00s)

[statement a couple weeks ago that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m02s)

[oftentimes events if you're if you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m03s)

[writing a custom event you're probably](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m05s)

[doing it wrong](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m07s)

[because using things like the messenger](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m08s)

[is probably a better solution in most](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m10s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m12s)

[but events still serve a purpose](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m14s)

[they will never completely go away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m17s)

[so it is important to know this and so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m19s)

[you do need to be conscious of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m21s)

[when you need to to unregister so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m24s)

[in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m27s)

[the loaded event exists on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m29s)

[the window and the window is capturing a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m31s)

[reference to itself which](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m33s)

[from the garbage collector's perspective](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m36s)

[that's fine when the window isn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m38s)

[referenced by anything else that it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m40s)

[not like it's reference counted it it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m42s)

[will collect objects that are basically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m44s)

[in a big ball if there's no reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m47s)

[linking back to the root](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m51s)

[that whole branch of objects gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m52s)

[consumed by the garbage collector and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m54s)

[cleans up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m55s)

[where things start to get weird](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m56s)

[is say we pass in an object and we do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h07m59s)

[like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m02s)

[view model dot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m03s)

[property change and we start registering](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m05s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m07s)

[right so now now things start to get a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m08s)

[little more interesting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m10s)

[because now what we've done is the view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m14s)

[model is going to have a reference to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m17s)

[the window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m19s)

[so this is now a bit more problematic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m22s)

[and this is why](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m24s)

[why two two lines of code that look](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m25s)

[very similar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m28s)

[right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m30s)

[very similar lines of code this second](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m32s)

[one is not problematic because it's the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m34s)

[window referencing the window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m37s)

[okay we're good those will get cleaned](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m40s)

[up in this case the view model is now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m41s)

[capturing a reference back to the window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m45s)

[so these things will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m49s)

[only be cleaned up together now in that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m52s)

[case or i should say in this case we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m54s)

[probably we'll be fine because i know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h08m56s)

[that my di container is registering](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m00s)

[those as singleton there's only going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m02s)

[be one instance of each of those the app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m03s)

[shuts down after the main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m05s)

[terminates yada yada but that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m06s)

[that's not a generalized statement that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m09s)

[i can apply to to any other apps i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m11s)

[because of outside knowledge i know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m13s)

[that's fine normally if you register up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m15s)

[an event on some dependency like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m17s)

[you want to be very careful that you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m20s)

[appropriately unregistered as well](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m21s)

[because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m23s)

[otherwise what will happen is this view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m24s)

[model is holding a reference to this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m26s)

[window now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m29s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m30s)

[this dot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m35s)

[so if we register a loaded event in for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m36s)

[example nested button instances down in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m38s)

[the tree yeah so in those cases if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m40s)

[are registering for you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m43s)

[i so i it depends a little bit on where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m46s)

[you do the registration but most of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m49s)

[times those will be just fine that you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m51s)

[won't need to unregister for so like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m53s)

[click events on button handlers and that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m55s)

[kind of thing um those will be just fine](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h09m57s)

[simply because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m00s)

[in my opinion unless you're doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m02s)

[something fancy inside of your app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m04s)

[typically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m06s)

[those buttons the time when you want](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m07s)

[those to be garbage collected is when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m09s)

[the window is closed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m11s)

[because oftentimes when that that the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m12s)

[the containing control is done](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m16s)

[it they can go as they can go away as a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m20s)

[unit now there may be times where maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m22s)

[you're doing some fancy dynamic swapping](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m24s)

[of ui stuff maybe that isn't always true](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m26s)

[in that case you might want to pay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m28s)

[attention to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m30s)

[in general it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m31s)

[in general if you're just registering](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m32s)

[for like button click handlers](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m34s)

[um and the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m36s)

[the place where you're doing the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m38s)

[registration is inside of its container](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m39s)

[like inside of its window or inside of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m41s)

[its user control etc](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m43s)

[you'll be fine because as soon as that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m45s)

[container has no outside references](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m46s)

[referencing it that whole chunk goes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m49s)

[away goes away as a unit because again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m51s)

[the the garbage collector if there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m53s)

[nothing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m55s)

[no reference is linking it back to the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m56s)

[root of your app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m57s)

[then it dies you can think of it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h10m59s)

[if there's nothing that links it back](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m01s)

[to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m05s)

[anything inside of main it just gets cut](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m06s)

[off so if they can't find a reference](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m09s)

[chain through the instances back to main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m11s)

[that whole that whole branch gets cut](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m14s)

[and garbage collected and thrown away](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m16s)

[which is good that that's that's what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m19s)

[you want you don't want to get into](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m21s)

[those cases where um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m22s)

[like in where in other languages where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m25s)

[you have to manage your memory or do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m27s)

[like reference counting um circular](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m29s)

[references in in ref counted languages](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m32s)

[get to be an interesting problem to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m35s)

[solve because if if a references b if b](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m37s)

[references a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m39s)

[they both have a ref count of one they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m40s)

[never get cleaned up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m42s)

[and c sharp with garbage collecting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m44s)

[because we follow that tree all the way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m45s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m47s)

[we can just say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m48s)

[no even though they reference each other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m49s)

[there's nothing coming there's no](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m51s)

[references coming into that group we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m53s)

[just get rid of the whole group](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m54s)

[and so it just goes away so in that in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m56s)

[that regard we're fine](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h11m58s)

[so okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m01s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m03s)

[well that was disappointing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m05s)

[that was disappointing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m07s)

[one second i just built some mountain](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m10s)

[dew](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m12s)

[thankfully not on anything important but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m13s)

[i now need to do a small amount of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m19s)

[cleanup uh this is true only for routed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m20s)

[events if we declare on uh c-sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m23s)

[events uh so no not not just for routed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m25s)

[events this applies to all c](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m29s)

[uh any any c-sharp event so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m31s)

[um anything that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m34s)

[where you're using plus equals](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m36s)

[um to register up for that will apply to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m38s)

[it so the the key thing to look for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m41s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m44s)

[you got to get the mountain dew up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m46s)

[before the sugar leaves a nice sticky](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m47s)

[residue on everything](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m49s)

[when you are registering for an event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m54s)

[just be aware of what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m55s)

[of what is going to be captured so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h12m57s)

[when you do plus equals on the event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m00s)

[what actually gets built up inside of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m02s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m04s)

[is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m07s)

[the instance as well as what's the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m08s)

[method info it's the system reflection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m11s)

[object that denotes how to call one of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m13s)

[these methods](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m16s)

[the other thing to note so this one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m17s)

[right here is capturing this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m19s)

[it's capturing the this variable of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m21s)

[window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m24s)

[however it won't capture that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m25s)

[this is a static method so you'll note](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m27s)

[before when i had this dot in front of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m31s)

[it it was perfectly fine to do the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m33s)

[registration because it was capturing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m35s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m37s)

[but now that it's static it wants me to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m38s)

[drop it and this just comes from the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m40s)

[fact that c sharp doesn't make you do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m41s)

[all this typing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m43s)

[which is which is great that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m45s)

[make you do the typing but it means you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m46s)

[need to know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m48s)

[what's actually going on when you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m50s)

[compile this because it will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m55s)

[because it's going to even though the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m56s)

[code has the same characters in it it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h13m58s)

[will do different things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m00s)

[so so that that's that's worth knowing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m03s)

[about and keeping track of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m06s)

[uh so if we declare our own custom click](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m08s)

[event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m10s)

[and another control subscribes to it and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m11s)

[don't unsubscribe can you see erase it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m13s)

[when the control is unloaded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m17s)

[it depends](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m21s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m23s)

[if the um if the other control is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m24s)

[inside of it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m31s)

[then i would say you don't need to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m32s)

[unsubscribe from it and you can just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m34s)

[assume that those things are going to go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m35s)

[as a unit and go it does depend on where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m37s)

[that other control is and how it gets a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m40s)

[reference to it so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m42s)

[typically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m44s)

[with in wpf you don't usually have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m46s)

[problems of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m48s)

[one control reaching reaching and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m50s)

[grabbing a control that's kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m52s)

[outside of its context](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m54s)

[however](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m56s)

[there you can there's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m57s)

[you from using like the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h14m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m00s)

[visual tree helper](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m02s)

[and just and just walking up and down](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m03s)

[your example finding a control grabbing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m06s)

[a reference and registering up a click](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m08s)

[handler on it there's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m09s)

[you from doing that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m11s)

[but that would be the case where i would](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m13s)

[be a lot more conscious about do i need](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m14s)

[to unregister the other case that often](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m16s)

[comes up where it can leak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m18s)

[is in like behaviors](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m23s)

[with wpf if you've done any of those](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m24s)

[like attached behaviors those can offer](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m26s)

[sometimes people will register event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m29s)

[handlers there and those can leak](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m30s)

[um so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m33s)

[i would say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m35s)

[in in general if you are registering on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m37s)

[a ui event or an event you create on a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m40s)

[ui object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m45s)

[you could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m46s)

[pay attention to what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m47s)

[what the the owner](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m49s)

[object is because when the event is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m51s)

[invoked or raised](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m54s)

[it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m56s)

[what has to happen is the runtime has to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h15m58s)

[know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m00s)

[where those handlers are to go and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m01s)

[invoke them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m02s)

[and so if those methods are instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m04s)

[methods in order to invoke this method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m07s)

[it needs to know the instance to invoke](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m09s)

[that on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m11s)

[which is great that that's exactly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m12s)

[that's exactly what we want i need to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m15s)

[know what instance to invoke this method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m17s)

[on if it's static](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m19s)

[i don't need an instance in fact i can't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m21s)

[have an instance in order to invoke it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m23s)

[so i think all i would suggest is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m27s)

[when you do a plus equals on an event](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m31s)

[just evaluate what the the owner](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m34s)

[instance is if any because again if it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m36s)

[static there won't be an owner instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m42s)

[and if that is problematic so for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m43s)

[example if i if i do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m46s)

[and sometimes it helps to type this dot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m48s)

[in front of the event because if it's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m51s)

[static you'll get a compiler telling you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m53s)

[hey this is static it's not actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m56s)

[going to capture it and if it's an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m58s)

[instance it will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h16m59s)

[it'll help you kind of reason about](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m01s)

[should view model](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m03s)

[have a hard reference to to this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m05s)

[variable here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m08s)

[and even if this method is on some other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m10s)

[object right no other dot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m12s)

[method](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m16s)

[should this should this guy have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m17s)

[reference to this guy](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m20s)

[it will that be a problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m24s)

[so if this is a ui element and this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m26s)

[if this is like a parent ui element and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m29s)

[this is a child ui element](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m31s)

[probably not an issue right window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m33s)

[closes when the window closes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m35s)

[oftentimes unless something is holding a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m37s)

[reference outside of the window if all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m39s)

[the things that are holding references](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m42s)

[to the window are inside of it like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m43s)

[their child buttons and that kind of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m45s)

[thing no problem garbage collector will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m46s)

[take care of it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m48s)

[but if there's something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m50s)

[outside of the window that's holding a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m51s)

[reference to it well now you have a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m53s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m55s)

[specifically the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m56s)

[the the common leaky case is if the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h17m58s)

[outside thing comes in via your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m01s)

[dependency uh injection container so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m03s)

[because your dependency injection](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m06s)

[container anything singleton it's going](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m07s)

[to hold on to those references for the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m09s)

[whole life of the application](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m11s)

[because they're single i should have one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m13s)

[and only one](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m15s)

[but that also means any references that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m17s)

[those singletons acquire](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m18s)

[they don't let go of unless you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m21s)

[explicitly let go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m24s)

[hope that answers the question](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m26s)

[but but good question about events](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m29s)

[because this is this is events are often](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m31s)

[a prime source of memory leaks](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m33s)

[um oftentimes when people track down ui](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m36s)

[interactions that are causing memory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m39s)

[leaks the first thing i do is just look](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m40s)

[for event handlers because very very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m42s)

[often that's that's where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m45s)

[where things are the the diagnostic](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m47s)

[tools are also gold for or tracking](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m49s)

[those things down](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m52s)

[okay so real quick](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m56s)

[how to determine when user control is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m56s)

[really deleted unloaded fires seems we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h18m58s)

[can't see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m02s)

[the element](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m03s)

[so i assume by deleted you mean garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m04s)

[collected](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m11s)

[and that's that's a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m13s)

[fun](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m15s)

[that's a fun one um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m17s)

[so there are so there's a couple things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m22s)

[to understand](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m24s)

[so first of all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m27s)

[one of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m28s)

[i will say quote unquote problems](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m29s)

[um is c sharp does not have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m32s)

[deterministic finalization meaning there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m34s)

[is no way for you to know exactly when a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m37s)

[control](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m40s)

[will be will be deleted or cleaned up by](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m41s)

[the garbage collector](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m46s)

[you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m46s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m48s)

[there is a destructor that you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m49s)

[declare](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m52s)

[this is what if you declare a destructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m55s)

[so this is a little tilde right in front](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m57s)

[of the class name](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h19m59s)

[this will get invoked um when the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m00s)

[garbage collector is cleaning up objects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m03s)

[and there are some absolutely horrible](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m06s)

[things you can do with this like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m08s)

[resurrect the object which](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m09s)

[you should not create zombie objects but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m12s)

[you can you shouldn't but you can um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m14s)

[so if you if you just want to know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m18s)

[when an object is being cleaned up via](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m21s)

[the garbage collector you could](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m24s)

[um you could do something like this uh i](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m27s)

[will i will caution on writing um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m30s)

[destructors though there is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m34s)

[performance hit by doing so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m39s)

[because now your garbage collector has](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m40s)

[to stop and invoke these methods that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m41s)

[previously didn't have to do so there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m43s)

[there's that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m46s)

[yeah not recommended to use a destructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m47s)

[at all and the other thing is you do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m50s)

[once you're inside of a destructor you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m52s)

[can't actually guarantee](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m55s)

[because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m58s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h20m59s)

[the cleanup isn't guaranteed to be in a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m00s)

[particular order you actually can't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m02s)

[guarantee that the references stored](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m04s)

[inside so for example](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m06s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m08s)

[view model right normally i would expect](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m09s)

[this is a read-only property](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m12s)

[i know it wasn't null when it came in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m14s)

[right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m18s)

[but it is actually possible](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m20s)

[to get into a situation where in here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m23s)

[it's null](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m25s)

[because the garbage collector could have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m27s)

[already cleaned that object up because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m29s)

[when when the uh garbage collector gets](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m32s)

[a group of objects to clean up those get](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m34s)

[thrown into a queue that get processed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m36s)

[and you can't guarantee where in that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m40s)

[queue you are which is another reason](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m42s)

[why a destructor is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m44s)

[really discouraged the the only useful](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m46s)

[part for this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m49s)

[is if you're dealing with unmanaged](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m50s)

[memory this can often be needed to make](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m52s)

[sure that you clean up unmanaged](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m55s)

[references so if you're referencing like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m56s)

[a a c plus library or similar where you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h21m58s)

[need to make sure you get stuff cleaned](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m00s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m02s)

[that's that's the use case for these uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m03s)

[is usually unmanaged stuff in c-sharp if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m05s)

[you do need to make sure that you know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m08s)

[when an object is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m10s)

[done or cleaned up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m11s)

[that is the you would use the eye](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m13s)

[disposable interface and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m15s)

[i will just uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m22s)

[there is i think this one has all of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m23s)

[docks on it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m26s)

[yeah and this yeah the eye disposable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m28s)

[docks are very good](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m31s)

[this is typically when people want to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m32s)

[know when an object is cleaned up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m34s)

[this is the way to do it um you'll note](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m37s)

[there's there's a lot of description in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m40s)

[here and the prop the proper way to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m42s)

[implement eye disposable can be quite](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m44s)

[complicated](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m46s)

[so complicated in fact](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m50s)

[visual studio 2022](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m51s)

[now has a nice built-in option to do it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m54s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m56s)

[highly recommend this it will steer you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m57s)

[into the path to success so if you do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h22m59s)

[decide that you want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m02s)

[you know what an object is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m04s)

[and i will clarify this isn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m07s)

[necessarily garbage collected this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m09s)

[disposed which is not quite the same](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m11s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m14s)

[uh no don't just implement interface](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m18s)

[so this will give you this pattern and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m22s)

[you'll note it comments out a destructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m27s)

[um which is different from a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m29s)

[deconstructor](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m30s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m32s)

[but it's worth](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m34s)

[noting that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m36s)

[that you only need this if you are](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m39s)

[freeing unmanaged resources](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m41s)

[and then the pattern of how to know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m44s)

[where where to dispose what where is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m46s)

[this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m49s)

[and so then the question of who invokes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m49s)

[disposing so for example i just made the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m51s)

[window disposable so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m54s)

[if you make something um eye disposable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h23m56s)

[what would then happen is that's what](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m00s)

[the using statement in c sharp leverages](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m02s)

[so view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m04s)

[uh var](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m06s)

[window gets new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m07s)

[main window right so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m10s)

[this this is this is horrible but we're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m12s)

[doing it anyway](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m15s)

[so and i'm i'm going to use the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m18s)

[the the specific using syntax so when](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m20s)

[you write a using statement like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m23s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m25s)

[the compiler has special support for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m27s)

[this eye disposable pattern what this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m29s)

[ends up doing is is building out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m32s)

[something that looks](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m34s)

[not exactly like this but it looks it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m36s)

[looks kind of like this so when you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m38s)

[write out this this using what the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m40s)

[compiler under the hood ends up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m43s)

[generating for you is something like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m45s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m50s)

[main](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m53s)

[window uh window oh i have to change the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m54s)

[name of it window 2](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h24m58s)

[right](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m00s)

[window 2](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m03s)

[dot dispose](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m06s)

[[Applause]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m07s)

[so it looks something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m10s)

[again this is this is not perfectly](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m13s)

[accurate but it's it's close](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m16s)

[window 2 gets new](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m21s)

[main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m22s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m25s)

[boom so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m26s)

[ignore the warnings something like this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m28s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m33s)

[using block here](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m34s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m37s)

[so the short version what ends up uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m39s)

[invoking dispose is typically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m41s)

[um usages of the using statement and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m45s)

[there are there are coding analyzers to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m48s)

[flag you if you if you if you have an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m50s)

[eye disposable object that you don't put](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m54s)

[in a user statement](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m58s)

[worth noting that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h25m59s)

[if you do want to say have an object](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m01s)

[where it allocates a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m03s)

[but in our case when a control is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m09s)

[deleted he can live](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m11s)

[i assume live half a day](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m16s)

[but in our case when when is the control](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m20s)

[deleted so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m22s)

[the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m23s)

[the easiest thing to do is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m25s)

[you you likely don't know and you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m29s)

[probably don't care](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m34s)

[and i'll i'll phrase it that that way so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m35s)

[the the garbage collector doesn't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m38s)

[it has](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m42s)

[built-in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m44s)

[heuristics to know when should it run so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m45s)

[oftentimes because when the garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m48s)

[collector runs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m50s)

[it ends up freezing your app](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m55s)

[you you want the garbage truck collector](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m57s)

[to run as fast as possible and as](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h26m59s)

[infrequent as possible](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m01s)

[those are the those two things can often](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m03s)

[be somewhat conflicting but because it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m05s)

[had because it can't necessarily work](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m08s)

[and i'm gonna put a little stardex to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m12s)

[because recent improvements have made](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m13s)

[this not true but it it can't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m15s)

[realistically work trying to clean up a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m17s)

[mess if your app is still busy making a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m19s)

[mess so oftentimes it pauses you cleans](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m21s)

[up the mess then lets you go again](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m24s)

[there's there's some fancy concurrent](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m27s)

[garbage collection stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m29s)

[and here are the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m30s)

[lots of ducks um c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m32s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m35s)

[collection there is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m40s)

[yeah there is a lot of a lot of depth](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m42s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m45s)

[in your case with using it creates and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m47s)

[deletes uh at a time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m49s)

[correct so in this case](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m52s)

[and it i shouldn't say it deletes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m54s)

[it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m56s)

[creates the window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m57s)

[calls dispose](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h27m59s)

[but i but i don't actually care when it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m01s)

[gets deleted because it's going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m04s)

[allocate some memory for my window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m06s)

[and then when this thing leaves scope so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m09s)

[even if i did this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m11s)

[even without the eye disposable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m13s)

[i'm going to instantiate a main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m15s)

[object it's going to live i'm going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m17s)

[fall out of scope and then no one's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m19s)

[holding a reference to this so this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m22s)

[going to be memory if you're familiar](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m23s)

[with like c programming this is going to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m25s)

[call malik it's going to allocate some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m27s)

[memory for my main window](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m29s)

[it's going to live](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m31s)

[and then once it falls out of scope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m32s)

[because no one's holding a reference to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m35s)

[this even though that memory has been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m36s)

[allocated at some point something needs](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m37s)

[to deallocate that memory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m40s)

[and this is where the garbage collector](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m42s)

[comes into play where](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m44s)

[at some point in time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m46s)

[it's going to run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m48s)

[and realize hey there was this variable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m50s)

[that got allocated no one's referencing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m52s)

[this anymore this variable is now out of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m55s)

[scope](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m57s)

[that memory that got allocated that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h28m58s)

[available to be reclaimed and that's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m00s)

[what the garbage collector will end up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m02s)

[doing is deallocating that memory and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m03s)

[taking it back at some point in the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m05s)

[future](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m07s)

[you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m09s)

[if there is a point](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m10s)

[where where you want to actually try to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m12s)

[get cleanup to happen like for example](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m15s)

[if i know that this view model is is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m17s)

[really big and i'm all done with it and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m20s)

[i and i kind of want to hint to the the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m22s)

[garbage collector please go clean this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m23s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m25s)

[i can break my references so so simply](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m26s)

[no longer having a reference to that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m30s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m32s)

[so i i throw away that instance and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m34s)

[we're going to pretend that the di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m36s)

[container isn't holding in it's a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m37s)

[reference to it but we we break our](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m38s)

[references to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m41s)

[and then you can tell the garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m42s)

[collector to to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m44s)

[or i should say](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m46s)

[you can force an immediate run over it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m47s)

[and try to tell the garbage collector to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m52s)

[run this this will make it go](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m54s)

[it won't guarantee that you're cleaned](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m57s)

[up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h29m58s)

[so we have no way to find out if the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m00s)

[control was removed to sum up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m02s)

[no way](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m04s)

[reasonably in code](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m06s)

[what you can do if you are on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m07s)

[visual studio or there's various other](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m10s)

[tools](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m13s)

[so for example uh am i debugging](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m15s)

[i am not](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m20s)

[here i'll show this so there's there's a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m22s)

[um if you poke around online you'll find](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m24s)

[various memory management tools i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m26s)

[gonna clean up some of this code real](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m28s)

[quick before i before i do something](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m30s)

[stupid like leave it in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m32s)

[because if what you're interested in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m35s)

[tracking down is hey has my control been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m36s)

[cleaned up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m40s)

[what you can do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m41s)

[so we'll start this app up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m43s)

[so these are the diagnos this is just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m48s)

[the basic diagnostic tools inside of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m50s)

[visual studio i believe this is only](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m52s)

[visual studio pro and enterprise though](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m54s)

[if you're on community i don't think it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m56s)

[has this tool](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h30m59s)

[don't quote me on that um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m01s)

[i think that's true](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m03s)

[i sometimes forget what's available in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m06s)

[different skus so the the important](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m07s)

[thing to note um when the app is up and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m10s)

[running oh stay big um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m12s)

[is where did it go there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m15s)

[is this process memory so this is the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m18s)

[stuff that's been allocated and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m20s)

[everywhere where you see one of these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m21s)

[little yellow](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m22s)

[um things this indicates that was a gc](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m24s)

[that was the garbage collector going](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m27s)

[through and cleaning stuff up so you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m29s)

[see right at the beginning when there](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m31s)

[was a bunch of allocations likely stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m32s)

[being created and destroyed um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m34s)

[things got](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m37s)

[got cleaned up fairly rapidly in rapid](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m39s)

[succession and then we got out here and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m41s)

[we're pretty stable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m44s)

[uh in case if we want to know and wait](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m46s)

[when the control is deleted to run some](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m49s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m51s)

[i would propose that you probably](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m54s)

[don't care about when it's garbage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m58s)

[collected and only care about when the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h31m59s)

[control is no longer in your view](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m01s)

[so in that case i would i would propose](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m08s)

[that what you are really looking for is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m10s)

[like the unloaded event on your control](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m11s)

[but in terms of memory usage what you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m18s)

[can do is take a snapshot](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m20s)

[which will](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m22s)

[this will look at all of the objects](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m23s)

[that are allocated and you can see them](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m24s)

[here and that's that's great and then we](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m26s)

[can do some stuff like i can open this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m28s)

[up you can see when i open when i open](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m30s)

[the pop-up there's a little a little](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m32s)

[bump in memory and what i'm what i'm](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m34s)

[mostly interested in is a small bump in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m36s)

[memory is fine because i'm now doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m38s)

[stuff but what i don't want to see is it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m40s)

[continually go up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m44s)

[no longer in the view doesn't mean that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m45s)

[the control is deleted correct i guess](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m48s)

[the question is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m51s)

[i would be interested to understand why](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m54s)

[deleted is the case that we're looking](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m57s)

[for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h32m59s)

[in general in c sharp you you usually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m05s)

[you don't usually care when an object is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m06s)

[deleted](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m08s)

[you may care to do something after](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m09s)

[it's been dereferenced](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m13s)

[so like after you've nulled out all your](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m15s)

[references to it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m16s)

[um but in those cases you typically](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m19s)

[would leverage](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m21s)

[the in those case because you're you're](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m22s)

[saying an object has a defined lifetime](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m24s)

[you would oftentimes use idisposable if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m26s)

[it's a wpf ui object you would](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m29s)

[oftentimes use like the the unloaded](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m32s)

[event or if it's a window the closed](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m35s)

[event to know okay this thing is now](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m37s)

[is now is now unreferenced because at](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m41s)

[that point the the item is is cleaned up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m43s)

[and then if there's some sort of um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m47s)

[like shutdown or similar code](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m50s)

[that's when you would typically go and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m52s)

[run it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m55s)

[usually so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h33m58s)

[but it's somewhat rare to need to run](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m02s)

[code after an item has been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m05s)

[and and i almost don't like the word](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m08s)

[deleted uh deallocated might be a better](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m10s)

[word](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m12s)

[because controls aren't necessarily](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m16s)

[deleted they are they're allocated in](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m18s)

[memory and they are deallocated from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m20s)

[memory](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m22s)

[which i've been equating deleted and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m23s)

[deallocated and perhaps that's not the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m25s)

[appropriate thing to do](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m28s)

[if i if i'm misunderstanding the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m29s)

[question let me know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m31s)

[anyway so pop-up i took a snapshot you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m35s)

[take a second snapshot and then usually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m37s)

[what you do is you compare these two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m39s)

[snapshots and look at and say oh okay so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m40s)

[between these two](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m43s)

[these two snapshots i've allocated](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m45s)

[an additional what is that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m48s)

[2.3 meg give or take um and then you can](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m50s)

[start to dive in and figure out okay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m54s)

[what are the differences between these](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h34m58s)

[we should not worry about the elements](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m01s)

[when they are removed should rely on gc](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m02s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m05s)

[correct the one thing you do have to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m06s)

[keep track of though is making sure that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m08s)

[that you have appropriately broken all](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m10s)

[of the the hard references that you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m12s)

[think you have](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m14s)

[so that is that is the one thing in c](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m17s)

[sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m18s)

[to very much keep track of is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m19s)

[making sure that you've cleaned it up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m23s)

[thank you for the answers very](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m26s)

[interesting talk no problem like i said](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m27s)

[i enjoy questions and i don't mind](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m28s)

[rabbit trailing off on on other things](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m31s)

[especially if something leads into](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m33s)

[questions about it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m35s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m38s)

[i think i am probably going to wrap up](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m39s)

[for the night though i was](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m42s)

[going to do some of the testing stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m44s)

[with this but i might leave that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m46s)

[i might leave that for another talk so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m48s)

[if people are interested and see so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m50s)

[we've gone through and talked about di](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m52s)

[and structuring our classes](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m54s)

[and this is this is all well and good](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h35m59s)

[but one of the main reasons for for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m01s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m03s)

[this uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m04s)

[more loose coupling um of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m06s)

[application is to make it more testable](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m08s)

[and easier to refactor so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m11s)

[i initially wrote this app quick and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m14s)

[dirty with with lots of coupling because](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m16s)

[i wanted to go fast and that that is how](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m19s)

[you go fast that method is just really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m22s)

[bad for refactoring and really bad for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m25s)

[testing so anything that needs to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m27s)

[maintained long term](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m29s)

[probably don't want to do that um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m31s)

[it tends to tends to add a lot of tech](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m33s)

[debt that you you end up having to pay](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m35s)

[back with interest](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m37s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m38s)

[um i think i will probably end up doing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m39s)

[a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m42s)

[a structure on testing um if people find](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m43s)

[that interesting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m46s)

[but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m47s)

[definitely send send me comments um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m48s)

[either in the chat or](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m52s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m55s)

[people if people haven't figured out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m57s)

[my url scheme yet it's pretty simple um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h36m59s)

[but yeah feel free to to drop me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m02s)

[feedback i've appreciated every](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m04s)

[everybody who's left comments so far on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m08s)

[on the videos or or or messaged me](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m11s)

[directly with ideas um i do keep a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m13s)

[running list so if there is stuff that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m17s)

[is interesting to people](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m18s)

[oh boy oh justin bieber you you are on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m20s)

[fire i'm gonna switch this here real](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m23s)

[quick so let's see more about yourself](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m25s)

[education programming language do you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m27s)

[know](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m29s)

[uh wpf client architecture multi-library](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m30s)

[applications](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m33s)

[uh useful programs in your opinion for](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m35s)

[programming stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m39s)

[oh this is great stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m41s)

[about one uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m45s)

[applications unit testing](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m47s)

[essentially](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m48s)

[oh this is this is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m51s)

[okay once again i'm going to just](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m53s)

[all of this is getting copied and pasted](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m56s)

[right onto my word document](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h37m58s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m01s)

[perfect i will i will keep this stuff](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m02s)

[coming um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m04s)

[for people getting started actually hang](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m07s)

[on let me switch back here um there is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m09s)

[so uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m13s)

[this is shameless](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m14s)

[shameless plug um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m16s)

[essential c sharp](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m20s)

[so there is a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m22s)

[book put out](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m32s)

[essential c sharp by mark michaelis uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m33s)

[let's see open image in new tab](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m35s)

[um but uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m38s)

[for those people who can't see it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m40s)

[shameless self plug i was one of the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m42s)

[technical editors so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m44s)

[if](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m47s)

[i am a little biased towards it](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m48s)

[um but if people are are interested in a](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m51s)

[c sharp book i will comment it's its](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m54s)

[intended audience is really for people](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m57s)

[um getting started](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h38m59s)

[uh so it is the like chapter one is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m02s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m05s)

[basic hello world so if if you haven't](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m07s)

[written any code and you're just getting](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m09s)

[into it this is this is expected to take](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m11s)

[you from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m14s)

[um almost nothing all the way up to](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m15s)

[competent in c-sharp so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m18s)

[just be aware that for some people who](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m21s)

[have a programming background some of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m23s)

[the early chapters may feel like they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h39m25s)

[setpro wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m28s)

[windowspresentationfoundation.net45](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m30s)

[yeah so and i will say this uh with wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m33s)

[specific content um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m36s)

[there has been](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m40s)

[very little that has changed in wpf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m42s)

[from](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m46s)

[net framework through the.net core](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m47s)

[versions there's only a handful of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m49s)

[really](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m51s)

[tiny](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m52s)

[tiny things that have even](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m55s)

[happened in there and most of the time](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m57s)

[people won't won't catch them so like](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h41m58s)

[there's a few namespace things and that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m01s)

[kind of stuff so even if you find an](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m03s)

[older wpf uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m05s)

[book](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m07s)

[like 95 of that content is still going](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m08s)

[to be spot on with wpf today](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m11s)

[even if it was written for wpf on.net](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m14s)

[framework 4.5](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m16s)

[there's going to be a few like there the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m18s)

[some of the c-sharp interf](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m20s)

[the c-sharp apis if they reference the](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m22s)

[base class library some of those there's](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m24s)

[going to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m26s)

[updated stuff on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m27s)

[up to some updated syntax things but](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m29s)

[again most of the content on wpf and](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m31s)

[especially all of the concepts are going](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m33s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m35s)

[pretty much identical](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m36s)

[so i i will say that if people if you](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m38s)

[find that people are recommending books](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m40s)

[that are older on wpf um their content](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m42s)

[is is](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m45s)

[usually still spot on](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m49s)

[um i would just disregard anything that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m50s)

[has version numbers in it so when they](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m52s)

[say install.net framework](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m56s)

[yeah yeah don't do that](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h42m59s)

[ignore version numbers but the rest of](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h43m02s)

[the content is probably pretty good](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h43m04s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h43m07s)

[yeah unfortunately the the twitch chat](https://youtu.be/j3pl2tkBM1A?t=02h43m08s)
