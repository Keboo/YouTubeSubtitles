[dive in on something it is very good I I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m00s)

[moved away from resharper because it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m04s)

[ended up being a bit of a a resource Pig](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m06s)

[on my visual studio and I went the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m08s)

[judgment call and I went nah I it's no](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m17s)

[longer worth it for me for people who](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m20s)

[are learning I will say the jet brains](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m22s)

[products are exceptionally good because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m24s)

[unlike the regular Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m27s)

[analyzers they like have little options](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m28s)

[to show you the why behind things which](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m30s)

[is really like resharper was an amazing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m33s)

[which was](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m40s)

[cool so if you have access to it it is a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m41s)

[really good tool and I think Ryder Ryder](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m44s)

[is like having Visual Studio Plus jet](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m47s)

[brains only without the slowdowns](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m49s)

[because resharper has to do battle with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m52s)

[the fact that it's limited by visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h13m54s)

[would I use it yes I think I need I I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m09s)

[think I need to spend some time with it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m12s)

[to actually feel like I am as proficient](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m13s)

[with it as I am in Visual Studio I think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m17s)

[right now um it is a tool that I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m19s)

[have as much knowledge or experience](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m23s)

[with and so I don't feel as productive](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m25s)

[but I know it has the power because I've](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m27s)

[got colleagues that use it very very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m29s)

[effectively uh I will also say the the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m31s)

[three-way merge tool in writer I think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m35s)

[might be the best three-way merge tool](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m38s)

[I've seen and it's only because it can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m41s)

[cheat um because it has knowledge of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m44s)

[the language it can do better than a lot](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m48s)

[of git uh three-way merge tools because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m51s)

[most git tools don't have language](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m54s)

[semantic knowledge they only have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m56s)

[textual BAS based comparisons so writer](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h14m58s)

[can be a little more intelligent about](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m01s)

[like if you've reordered a bunch of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m03s)

[right that you can do um Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m10s)

[keybinds into writer um and so it's it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m12s)

[one that like I said I think I just need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m15s)

[to spend some time to get a little more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m17s)

[maybe I'll throw that on on my stream](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m22s)

[list here as as ideas of things to to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h15m24s)

[the one that I assume is going to be the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h19m15s)

[easiest the material design Library rev](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h19m17s)

[so what what was your build failure](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h19m20s)

[update to this template they rerun it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h20m49s)

[and then go and correct all my mistakes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h20m52s)

[it's been quite wonderful Okay so we've](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h20m53s)

[got a bunch of updates](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h20m56s)

[uh we are not going to do preview](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m00s)

[release let's try this without it and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m01s)

[then we'll see what the thing is that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m02s)

[it's squawking about okay so let's start](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m04s)

[with the material design one because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m07s)

[that's that's going to be one of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m09s)

[easiest ones to update I think because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m11s)

[in theory I know something about this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m13s)

[update let's see there are two package](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m17s)

[sources defined in your configuration](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m19s)

[when using centralized packag M specify](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m21s)

[single package Source uh what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m24s)

[uh okay so this is also built on an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m29s)

[older version of my template that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m33s)

[doesn't include the new get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m34s)

[config where's my n get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m36s)

[config do I not have a n get config to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m39s)

[find in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m41s)

[here well that's just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m43s)

[dumb I'm an idiot okay so we we okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m46s)

[we'll fix that warning too while we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m51s)

[in here and we will learn something](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m52s)

[about nit package Source mapping](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m54s)

[um it says I have two oh I bet you I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h21m59s)

[have two sources defined in my you I do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m03s)

[I do because you'll see I have this like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m07s)

[net net 8 internal one here right this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m10s)

[is this one I believe is coming from](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m18s)

[my yeah cuz Local's in this list too](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m22s)

[these are coming from my my user profile](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m24s)

[n get config](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m27s)

[uh this is why it is good to have a Nate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m29s)

[config in your repository so that things](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m31s)

[like that aren't problematic okay so we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m33s)

[we go and launch and I am going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m36s)

[assume because I think it's this test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m38s)

[app one that uses material design yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m41s)

[and I'm going to go out on a limb and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m44s)

[guess that the breaking change is one of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m45s)

[the 50 changes which is going to be yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m47s)

[right there so one of the key changes in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m50s)

[the material design library on the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m54s)

[release so if we go to the discussions](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m56s)

[tab there's a 5 migration guide so and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h22m59s)

[if people find issues with it please](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m01s)

[flag me but this one here there's a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m03s)

[reason it's big and at the top because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m05s)

[it's the first thing people run into is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m06s)

[previously we used to use just a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m10s)

[default. zaml but we have both material](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m12s)

[design two and material design three](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m14s)

[styling so depending on which one you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m17s)

[want in your app please pick the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m19s)

[appropriate dictionary and update this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m21s)

[app was initi if you want the latest and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m23s)

[greatest stuff pick three if you want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m25s)

[change pick two right that's kind of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m28s)

[I just want to stay consistent I want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m32s)

[latest cool things that that's kind of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m35s)

[the choice you're making there if it if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m37s)

[that helps uh some styles are identical](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m39s)

[between two and three some of them are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m42s)

[different right um but that is almost](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m44s)

[assuredly the problem right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m47s)

[there right and then we can uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m50s)

[here we have test for the test app I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m53s)

[believe](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h23m57s)

[um and I think if we just launch this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m00s)

[one this will be good enough to validate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m02s)

[that it actually launches as you can see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m03s)

[that it runs uh app app test and we may](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m06s)

[see the thing pop here in a minute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m09s)

[ignore the green check marks I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m11s)

[believe it has not actually run the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m13s)

[window is opening on the side where no](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m15s)

[one can see it which is just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m18s)

[lovely okay but that now that now worked](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m20s)

[okay so that fixes that nougat issue](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m24s)

[we're going to just do a quick commit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m28s)

[here going to put myself not in front of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m29s)

[everybody's face okay stage changes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m31s)

[we're going to double check what we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m34s)

[did there's that there's that packages](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m37s)

[props uh bumping](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m41s)

[mdx2](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m43s)

[5.1.0 great bippity boppity first one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m45s)

[done okay uh let's see Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m49s)

[debugger](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m52s)

[interupt do that one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m53s)

[next oh actually let's do the the new](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m55s)

[get config one I think I want to address](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h24m59s)

[that before I get too carried away um if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m02s)

[I go to my templates](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m05s)

[repository and I look at my template](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m07s)

[this is why I like my templates because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m09s)

[I can steal from myself future Kevin](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m11s)

[likes current Kevin okay so this is what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m13s)

[a nit config ends up looking like and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m18s)

[the key thing here is you map what uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m20s)

[nugat sources your packages should](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m25s)

[restore from the idea here is to kind of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m30s)

[mitigate uh supply chain attacks where](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m31s)

[somebody posts out a different thing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m34s)

[because if you have more than one nougat](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m36s)

[Source uh as a potential do you know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m38s)

[which one the package comes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m41s)

[from the answer which everyone replies](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m43s)

[first right so the as a a supply chain](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m48s)

[attack what you do is you get yourself](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m52s)

[in the list of potential n get sources](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m54s)

[for the build box and you reply really](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m56s)

[really fast like you make your uh your](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h25m59s)

[are almost guaranteed to reply before](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m07s)

[every API call that's made and therefore](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m09s)

[your package gets brought in when](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m12s)

[soft. Json over the real one and that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m16s)

[the problem right but if there's a n get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m19s)

[of the Clone rather than just mucking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m34s)

[with something on the system so that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m36s)

[the that's the basic premise right so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m39s)

[we're going to go this we're going to go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h26m41s)

[I always like to add these things into](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m09s)

[my solution items because these are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m11s)

[things I like to see boom right now this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m13s)

[Nu](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m18s)

[157 should go bye-bye](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m20s)

[and the other way that you can test this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m31s)

[is yeah so you will](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m33s)

[note why did that yeah there they go I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m37s)

[was like why are they still there the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m39s)

[other way that you can um check this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m41s)

[if you go manage nougat packages you can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m43s)

[see I no longer have that list of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m46s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m48s)

[sources right because it's going to use](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m49s)

[the first nougat package uh or nougat](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m51s)

[config that it finds and since there's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m54s)

[one in the solution that one wins and it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m56s)

[doesn't walk up to my user directory one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h27m58s)

[which makes me question why I set some](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m00s)

[of those other ones in my user profile](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m02s)

[config when I probably only needed those](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m04s)

[for one or two projects past Kevin was](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m06s)

[probably an idiot so uh let's add that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m08s)

[in so let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m12s)

[see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m16s)

[adding you get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m18s)

[config okay see we're cruising right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m22s)

[along uh debugger interrupt this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m25s)

[gets to be a fun one so what was let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m28s)

[look real quick well go ahead and apply](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m31s)

[yep let's see do you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m35s)

[have if I go back to the poll](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m38s)

[requests do you have build logs that I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m42s)

[can look at you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m44s)

[do okay so compilation failure EnV DTE](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m48s)

[could not be found so there's a breaking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m53s)

[change in the new get package okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m56s)

[that sounds simple enough to show me Z](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h28m59s)

[breing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m01s)

[change look at that hey at least the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m06s)

[airs look like the the build pipeline](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m11s)

[so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hush hush](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m15s)

[hush hush hush okay so this is a bit of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m17s)

[code inside of zaml test that I am both](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m19s)

[proud and horrified of so I do not get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m23s)

[to take credit for this this was poached](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m26s)

[off of I think an obsolete blog post](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m28s)

[that I that I tracked down at one point](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m32s)

[um where somebody else actually showed](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m35s)

[off doing this I then promptly took it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m36s)

[and abused it for my own](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m39s)

[purposes uh because the blog post was](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m41s)

[not doing this with it and then I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m43s)

[promptly was like I'm doing that uh the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m45s)

[idea here is when you launch zaml test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m49s)

[it starts uh your your WPF app or its](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m51s)

[own app shell as a separate process](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m56s)

[process and then it connects to it via](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h29m58s)

[grpc and that's how it talks back and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m01s)

[forth so when it's testing uh your WPF](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m03s)

[components it's actually running inside](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m06s)

[of a WPF application there's no smoking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m08s)

[mirrors my opinion the best way to test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m10s)

[a WPF component is inside of WPF app](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m12s)

[shell because that's what the real app](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m15s)

[is going to be doing so it does that but](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m18s)

[then you want to be able to debug that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m22s)

[remote app that's been launched so that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m24s)

[you can see your stuff going this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m26s)

[when you run your test with zamble test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m29s)

[if it sees Visual Studio attached to the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m31s)

[running test process it'll reach across](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m33s)

[and automatically attach Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m36s)

[to the other one which is terrifyingly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m38s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m42s)

[um okay so this guy here we got to look](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m44s)

[and see what we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m47s)

[doing this is hunting](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m48s)

[out the object here and looking to cast](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m52s)

[it into a DTE what did we actually need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h30m59s)

[for um cuz we're just looking to get the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m00s)

[visual studio instance because we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m04s)

[looking for the thing with the debugger](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m05s)

[property to be able to pull that off and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m07s)

[before it was inside of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m10s)

[environment let's go with spelunking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m13s)

[real](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m15s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m16s)

[uh because what is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m18s)

[the what do we change in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m20s)

[here uh I want this one please this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m24s)

[so EnV DTE it was the old name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m28s)

[space that is apparently now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m35s)

[gone uh let me see here this might be a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m44s)

[search on the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m48s)

[interwebs uh Visual Studio debugger](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m51s)

[interop uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h31m55s)

[EnV](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m00s)

[DTE I wonder if it moved](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m04s)

[places uh it claims to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m08s)

[exist oh this is going to be one of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m13s)

[those things that bites me because they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m15s)

[broke the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m18s)

[change uh through the DTE object via](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m23s)

[yeah that's what I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m26s)

[that's what we trying to do let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m28s)

[Visual Studio interrup oh hold up hold](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m31s)

[up hold](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m35s)

[up I have a sinking suspicion I know the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m39s)

[problem I am noticing something a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m44s)

[different between my package name and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m47s)

[that package](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m49s)

[name yeah I have a sinking suspicion](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m53s)

[that's going to be the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m56s)

[kicker](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h32m59s)

[um where is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m02s)

[it where are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m05s)

[you yeah Visual Studio debugger](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m09s)

[interrupt and the API that I'm looking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m12s)

[for is inside of this package here so I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m15s)

[think they just reorganized their](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m19s)

[packages and that is what is hosing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m21s)

[me that is my working Theory so I need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m24s)

[that to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m28s)

[there yeah so you come into the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m35s)

[project okay we will deal with killing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m40s)

[the old one here in a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m43s)

[moment EnV](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m45s)

[DTE okay and now look at that we compile](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m48s)

[again okay so the key line in case it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m51s)

[wasn't obvious that caught my attention](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m55s)

[that right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h33m58s)

[there the fact that that did not match](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m00s)

[my package name that I had just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m02s)

[installed a moment](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m04s)

[ago okay so the short version they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m07s)

[reorganized their](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m09s)

[packages and mucked with some stuff okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m10s)

[we are going to while we're here we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m13s)

[going to inline some stuff because we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m16s)

[got clearly newer C syntax than what is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m19s)

[than what is being reported here um what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m24s)

[do you want me to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m28s)

[here introduce](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m29s)

[local no use discard I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m32s)

[want to do it so the the idea here with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m36s)

[um why the underscore equals versus just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m40s)

[doing this if you just invoke a method](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m43s)

[like this and it has a return value it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m45s)

[not clear uh to Future person whether](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m48s)

[the intent was to uh ignore the return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m51s)

[value or whether](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m55s)

[uh that's a mistake so if you do this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h34m58s)

[it's very clear then to Future person](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m01s)

[that no the intent here is I don't care](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m04s)

[about your return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m07s)

[value so it's a it's a very minor uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m09s)

[analyzer](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m13s)

[thing but as I don't trust future Kevin](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m14s)

[to actually do things properly uh we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m18s)

[going to do this um I do want to test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m21s)

[this really quick and I want to drop the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m24s)

[old package as well because I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m26s)

[believe I need that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m28s)

[anymore and then that means I don't need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m34s)

[anymore so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m38s)

[pretty okay let's make sure we still](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m40s)

[compile with the package gone and then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m43s)

[the the big test will be launching and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m46s)

[verifying that we can catch a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m48s)

[breakpoint uh the package](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m52s)

[reference oh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m55s)

[you shouldn't need that anymore either](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m58s)

[transitive dependencies](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h35m59s)

[please now why do I have this commented](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m04s)

[out here surprised I left this net core](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m07s)

[31 Net 5 both of those are dead](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m10s)

[Frameworks so uh no we don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m13s)

[support I do not support obsolete](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m17s)

[Frameworks I'm sorry](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m19s)

[um okay I think I think we're good there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m22s)

[uh so the the key thing that we want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m26s)

[test then is I would like uh I'd like a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m29s)

[break point here oh I got to show this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m32s)

[off too this is something that I hadn't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m35s)

[seen in a while okay do you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m38s)

[see this little icon right here it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m41s)

[little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m45s)

[icon so earlier this week I had somebody](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m48s)

[come to me and go I bet you I know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m51s)

[something about C you don't know and I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m53s)

[went okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m55s)

[surprised me and they showed me this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h36m58s)

[little button and I went I've never seen](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m00s)

[this button before this is something new](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m02s)

[I don't know if it's in the ga I I will](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m05s)

[point out I am running preview versions](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m07s)

[of Visual Studio specifically I am](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m09s)

[running uh Visual Studio 1712 preview 5](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m12s)

[so for what it is worth if your version](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m16s)

[is older than that it may or may not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m19s)

[exist this is a Nifty little button that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m20s)

[shows you where your Global usings are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m23s)

[coming from and and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m25s)

[it's worth calling out this is a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m28s)

[misleading because the the extra piece](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m32s)

[of data that you need to know in order](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m34s)

[for this to be useful is you have to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m36s)

[know that Ms build generates this file](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m38s)

[for you from Global usings that come in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m42s)

[Via Ms build like from your CS prods](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m45s)

[your directory build props are similar](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m48s)

[so some of these ones here and more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m50s)

[importantly in this particular case](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m52s)

[because I have a direct C build. props](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h37m55s)

[go away right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m00s)

[um I have a bunch of usings brought in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m03s)

[for me of just the common stuff and yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m07s)

[I am aware of implicit usings true](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m10s)

[right this this Project's a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m14s)

[special um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m16s)

[so if you know that and then you see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m19s)

[that you can now see what Global usings](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m22s)

[you have coming into your project and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m24s)

[where they are coming from if somebody](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m26s)

[puts a global using in a different C](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m28s)

[file it will tell you the name of set](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m31s)

[file and then you can go and open it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m33s)

[which is rather convenient so the lesson](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m35s)

[here is uh with the fancy new button you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m39s)

[can see where your Global usings are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m42s)

[coming from sort of sort of you can get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m44s)

[the file name that they're coming in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m47s)

[from you just have to know that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m49s)

[sometimes the file name may be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m51s)

[autogenerated okay so here's what we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m53s)

[going to do we are going to go here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m55s)

[and I've got a breakpoint in my test and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h38m59s)

[I've got a breakpoint in Main window.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m01s)

[xaml.cs and I expect to hit both of them](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m03s)

[when I debug this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m06s)

[test let's see if it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m08s)

[works I might need to check and confirm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m10s)

[that this thing enables debugging](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m14s)

[but oh look at that there's main](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m17s)

[window oh yes yes yes oh it makes me so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m21s)

[happy makes me so happy okay uh let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m26s)

[see so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m30s)

[that so you killed that got the right n](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m33s)

[get package there we're good cleaned up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m37s)

[some usings that's fine cleaned up some](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m39s)

[dead code cleaned up some formatting](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m42s)

[good directory your build props shows](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m44s)

[the package drop and the new package](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m47s)

[name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m48s)

[great uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m50s)

[updating uh what was the name of that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m52s)

[package this right here that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h39m55s)

[commit change okay two new gets done](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m00s)

[next Microsoft code analys code analysis](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m05s)

[analyzers okay let's go see do you have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m09s)

[a build failure I can look at let's go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m12s)

[back this is why I shouldn't ignore my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m17s)

[build failures because I'm sure I got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m19s)

[emailed about this I just get so many](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m21s)

[emails from GitHub I I apologize if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m23s)

[people think I'm ignoring you on GitHub](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m26s)

[I'm not I just get literally like 100 to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m28s)

[150 emails from GitHub a day it's a lot](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m33s)

[I and it's self-inflicted like I've set](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m36s)

[my notifications I've marked myself as](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m40s)

[watching particular repos and sometimes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m42s)

[I question my sanity in doing that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m45s)

[because I watch them and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m47s)

[then yeah I I then it unfortunately then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m50s)

[sends me emails about activity and often](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m53s)

[times I miss stuff](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m56s)

[okay uh is banned by analyzers](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h40m58s)

[non-incremental Source generators should](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m01s)

[not be used okay so we are going full](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m03s)

[aggressive mode got it okay this is a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m06s)

[good change this is a good change um but](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m09s)

[it is uh the overwhelm is real yes yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m13s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m17s)

[there this is something I need somebody](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m20s)

[to build for me with all of the AI stuff](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m22s)

[like there are things that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m24s)

[categorize and like summarize emails](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m28s)

[which is fine right what I would really](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m30s)

[like is to be able to tell an AI these](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m33s)

[are my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m35s)

[priorities please bubble up everything](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m37s)

[that is in line with my priorities and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m39s)

[like put everything else to the side for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m42s)

[me that's what I want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m44s)

[like I don't want summaries I don't want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m47s)

[groups I want to have a set of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m50s)

[priorities and be able to change it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m52s)

[somewhat arbitrarily on the fly as my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m54s)

[day goes and have it constantly Resort](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m56s)

[the stuff that's highest in my priority](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h41m59s)

[bucket but it would also be nice if it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m01s)

[could watch cuz it's like you know if my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m03s)

[boss emails me and says hey I need you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m05s)

[to do this thing right away that's an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m06s)

[email that should probably come to the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m08s)

[top probably like uh an old employer of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m10s)

[mine once told me he's like Kevin uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m14s)

[because he was a a manager that wasn't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m16s)

[directly above me he's like I don't sign](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m19s)

[your paycheck so if somebody who does](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m20s)

[sign your paycheck tells you to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m22s)

[something I do it and I'm like you know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m24s)

[what I remembered that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m26s)

[that one's stuck it's like yes got it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m27s)

[you're in charge but you're only kind of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m31s)

[in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m33s)

[charge okay incremental Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m35s)

[generators here we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m37s)

[go so uh Source generators are wow and I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m41s)

[even have typos in here man that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m45s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m48s)

[the this was written back in ye oldi](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m50s)

[Source generator API land and in the the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m53s)

[problem with The Source generators when](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m56s)

[Microsoft first released them is they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h42m58s)

[were good but they let people destroy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m00s)

[other people's Visual Studio performance](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m03s)

[which was not a good thing right they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m05s)

[could be written in a performant manner](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m07s)

[but the API kind of allowed people to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m09s)

[whatever they wanted and unfortunately](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m11s)

[that meant they did whatever they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m13s)

[wanted so the incremental Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m15s)

[generators kind of paired things down to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m17s)

[kind of force people down the right path](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m20s)

[of here's how you build an incremental](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m22s)

[Source generator properly and it's not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m25s)

[entirely trivial to do uh I myself have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m27s)

[screwed it up many times so we're going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m30s)

[to see how well I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m32s)

[do but that is the premise right Old](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m33s)

[Source generators dead incremental](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m36s)

[Source generators good they force people](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m38s)

[to do the right thing so that your](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m41s)

[Visual Studio performance doesn't tank](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m43s)

[and more importantly the generators can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m45s)

[all run and make everybody happy um if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m46s)

[you want to see some really good](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m49s)

[examples of source generators uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m51s)

[Community toolkit and M](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h43m55s)

[toolkit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m06s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m07s)

[Sergio he does some awesome work like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m10s)

[I've had the pleasure of chatting with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m14s)

[him before great guy really smart he can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m15s)

[build some high performance code so yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m19s)

[uh if you want good examples of source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m23s)

[generators they some nice ones in here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m25s)

[um for being able to G these things out](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m29s)

[so if you're interested in seeing some](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m31s)

[you know what I'm just going to throw](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m33s)

[this to the side because I might need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m34s)

[this in a minute we'll see we will see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m36s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m39s)

[specifically uh let's rev the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m40s)

[package and see what your problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m43s)

[is and actually you know what we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m53s)

[going to rev all of these together](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m55s)

[because I've had I've had bad](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h44m59s)

[experiences revving them in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m01s)

[independently of each other so we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m02s)

[going to rev all of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m11s)

[these let's see what's going on here now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m19s)

[good so now we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m23s)

[see debug](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m25s)

[yeah okay so this guy is all just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m28s)

[straight up I I hate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m30s)

[you and don't use this so we want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m33s)

[take the err and it's very clear](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m37s)

[Implement I incremental generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m39s)

[instead fine I incremental generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m41s)

[there we go now we are now we are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m45s)

[cruising okay what have I done I've got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m51s)

[way too much in one file](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h45m54s)

[now we have this guy and now I need to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m02s)

[remember how the heck to do this uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m04s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m07s)

[see yeah co-pilot that's not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m10s)

[right this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m13s)

[is uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m15s)

[register Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m18s)

[where I can't remember](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h46m22s)

[with it so let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h50m36s)

[context](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h50m45s)

[or oh they've got extra](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h50m49s)

[stuff see this is what I was worried](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h50m52s)

[about I might get bit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h50m54s)

[is the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h51m47s)

[kicker okay so maybe we start here that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h51m51s)

[gets me closer](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h51m54s)

[except for I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h51m56s)

[back](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m05s)

[um I am curious how they do some of this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m08s)

[maybe we'll leave it for the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m12s)

[there this is a this is just swing up a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m24s)

[values provider which is what is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m27s)

[actually needed](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m29s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m30s)

[work oh I see this is passing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m36s)

[in oh I go you so this is just uh values](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m39s)

[provider of types I've got a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m43s)

[types I build up visual Elements which](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m46s)

[have a visual element type and a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m50s)

[property so mine needs to just be visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m51s)

[element okay okay okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m53s)

[see now we're making progress](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h52m57s)

[incremental stop it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m01s)

[values provider of visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m04s)

[element uh I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m07s)

[know elements to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m11s)

[gener](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m15s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m18s)

[okay now the question is populating that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m20s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m25s)

[build](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m27s)

[enums so enom to generate create syntax](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m30s)

[provider so we need something akin to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m35s)

[this do a simple filter for enes blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m39s)

[blah blah right so this is going to end](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m42s)

[up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m44s)

[being co-pilot you are actually being](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m49s)

[more problematic than anything right now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m53s)

[because you are reading all the bad code](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m55s)

[and trying to help me let's see create](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h53m57s)

[syntax provider this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m00s)

[so okay co-pilot if you're going to help](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m04s)

[help otherwise get out of the way](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m07s)

[because you you're see see you're not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m09s)

[helping co-pilot you're you're actively](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m11s)

[sabotaging](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m13s)

[me I don't I don't want your help](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m16s)

[co-pilot I want you to go away so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m18s)

[predicate so this takes in a syntax node](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m19s)

[a cancellation token and a Bo which I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m22s)

[assume is what are the nodes that we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m24s)

[interested](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m26s)

[in and then it has a transform which](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m28s)

[lets us convert what I assume to be said](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m31s)

[nodes into RTS which in this case is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m33s)

[visual element conveniently I have that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m36s)

[code down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m39s)

[here so the syntax nodes that we are uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m41s)

[interested in grabbing are attribute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m45s)

[syntax nodes effectively this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m47s)

[my this is my check that I want that is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m50s)

[my wear Clause as I want attribute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m53s)

[syntax they need to have an argument and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m55s)

[they need to have a name that matches](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h54m57s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m00s)

[um and I think we might want that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m02s)

[too I'm just looking to I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m10s)

[the early returns is what I'm after in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m12s)

[here because that's an early return that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m14s)

[if breaks out so if we don't go inside](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m18s)

[this if I'm imagining the rest of it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m22s)

[doesn't matter this is a bunch of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m23s)

[transform](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m25s)

[stuff should use visual element blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m27s)

[blah blah blah blah that's a stat okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m30s)

[so I think this here is effectively my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m32s)

[if condition or my predicate so if we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m35s)

[come up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m38s)

[here all the way back up here um create](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m41s)

[syntax provider we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m46s)

[and we're going to go predicate cuz I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m48s)

[kind of like the having the name in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m50s)

[there and then none of what you have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m52s)

[done here is correct cop](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m55s)

[just shut up and go away hey give me the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m56s)

[syntax what were the what were the three](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h55m59s)

[parameters again syntax node](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m01s)

[cancellation token bu uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m03s)

[node cancellation token and then we need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m08s)

[to return a bu at the end of this sucker](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m14s)

[so we want this in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m16s)

[here this becomes node I think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m23s)

[hey thank you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m28s)

[pinkachu glad to see you again glad to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m30s)

[hear that you are hopefully back on the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m33s)

[mend and doing better so chat again](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m35s)

[soon uh okay so this is going to come](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m42s)

[down to a return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m45s)

[false and this becomes a return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m50s)

[true and this becomes a return false](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m53s)

[I think I think that's how this goes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h56m58s)

[yeah syntax node cancellation token](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m01s)

[predicate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m04s)

[okay and then we have a transform](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m07s)

[method](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m10s)

[transform and this guy takes in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m13s)

[a let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m16s)

[context right and then the comma there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m20s)

[uh let's see and he has a cancellation](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m26s)

[token and he wants to return a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m28s)

[t CT and actually we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m30s)

[do that and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m34s)

[then at the end of the day we want this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m37s)

[guy to be returning back a visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m40s)

[element so from Context we should have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m42s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m47s)

[node great okay so if we go down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m48s)

[here given the node and we've gotten all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m53s)

[the way through that this is the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h57m55s)

[bit that is actually going to build up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m00s)

[the visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m04s)

[element let's copy all of this because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m09s)

[this is this is doing elements add but I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m12s)

[think we're going to end up just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m14s)

[returning](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m15s)

[here we may even want to go as far as](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m21s)

[because I'm noticing there's technically](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m23s)

[this any check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m25s)

[but I think we probably want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m28s)

[to keep that so let's get rid of this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m31s)

[that's just in the way](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m35s)

[now uh you are also in the way so uh go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m36s)

[away great and then execute is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m40s)

[meaningless I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m43s)

[think we're going to keep it around](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m45s)

[because we might need some of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m47s)

[it okay so inside of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m49s)

[here uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h58m53s)

[how do we know it can we get the type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m01s)

[info](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m05s)

[uh what is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m18s)

[the might have to we might have to deal](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m21s)

[with not having access to the type info](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m23s)

[inside here it's also probably bad that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m25s)

[this thing was calling I guess it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m28s)

[calling type info on two separate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m29s)

[types but we would love to get the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m36s)

[attribute name of that we should be able](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m38s)

[to look at them the other one to see how](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m40s)

[did](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m44s)

[um not this one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m48s)

[the this guy here how did they identify](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m51s)

[which ones were](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m55s)

[theirs oh they've got their extra](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=00h59m58s)

[extension that tracks](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m00s)

[it interesting I might have to we might](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m07s)

[have to dive a little deeper into there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m12s)

[so sytax provider attribute list](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m14s)

[argument](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m17s)

[list and then down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m24s)

[here this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m27s)

[is this is effectively looking for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m31s)

[dupes okay and I need to indent this so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m38s)

[that I can see what the heck I'm doing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m40s)

[because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m42s)

[I uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m46s)

[return uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m51s)

[I think we want to get rid of this and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h00m57s)

[not do the filtering](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m00s)

[there and I think we just want to return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m03s)

[here and DD on the other side I think is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m10s)

[the game plan okay so what is your](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m13s)

[problem here uh that is the wrong for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m16s)

[Loop and we have lost specific number of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m19s)

[curly braces okay and that's the problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m22s)

[is we need extra closing curries okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m25s)

[the curly brace is now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m29s)

[balance that makes me feel](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m31s)

[better uh okay so here this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m34s)

[previously had the attribute syntax so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m38s)

[he needs to be able to go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m42s)

[context.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m44s)

[node um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m47s)

[right so I think we do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h01m58s)

[that um and actually we can name this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m03s)

[appropriately so I don't have to fight](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m06s)

[with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m07s)

[it okay and then argument](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m08s)

[list do that and then we can do double](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m14s)

[question mark double square](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m18s)

[braces for the empty](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m20s)

[collection that gets us through that and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m23s)

[now we have info.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m25s)

[type so info was coming from this and so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m29s)

[we were looking because we wanted to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m33s)

[walk up the base](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m35s)

[types uh let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m37s)

[see to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m39s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m42s)

[uh DD because the the issue here is if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m45s)

[two things derive from say element we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m49s)

[don't want to reprocess element multiple](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m51s)

[times](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m53s)

[because our attributes only going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m56s)

[exist on certain top level uh items like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h02m58s)

[the control](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m02s)

[types um ignore types we need we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m04s)

[going to need to pull](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m06s)

[up that is an easy one to do clean up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m08s)

[the collection](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m12s)

[initialization so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m15s)

[I'm going to copy rather than cut I'm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m17s)

[just going to put him right up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m20s)

[here so he can he can live there that'll](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m22s)

[make that one be happy is delegate is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m25s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m28s)

[somewhere and we kind of want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m29s)

[that so let's grab you and come up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m33s)

[higher with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m36s)

[you that's an is call which I assume](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m41s)

[that's the other one down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m44s)

[here which may or may not be a good way](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m46s)

[of doing this so we will double check it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m49s)

[but at least it gives us a starting](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m51s)

[point okay that compiles that comp](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m53s)

[files it gets me through a little bit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h03m56s)

[more should use visual element where is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m01s)

[that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m04s)

[declared should use visible](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m06s)

[element why it must be blind or](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m13s)

[stupid I don't see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m15s)

[it oh there it is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m21s)

[did I not bring down the local function](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m26s)

[when I copied it I probably](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m28s)

[didn't um why was it a local](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m31s)

[function just promote](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m39s)

[it problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m41s)

[solved so effectively it's limiting what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m43s)

[types of things it's going to go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m46s)

[after and abusing the two string method](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m48s)

[on elements to do type checks which is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m51s)

[not a good solution just to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m53s)

[clear okay I think that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h04m57s)

[gets the next bit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m00s)

[done we just need to figure out the type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m03s)

[type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m06s)

[remap I think this is that dictionary](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m07s)

[yeah yeah you you you you ugly little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m11s)

[thing um you can go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m16s)

[here I just needed to remap things from](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m19s)

[one to another so effectively The](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m22s)

[Collection types I map into a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m24s)

[generic ey](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m27s)

[list just so that they work nicely okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m30s)

[so that does all of that all of that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m34s)

[Maneuvers um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m38s)

[okay and now the question comes how the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m41s)

[heck do we get type information inside](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m44s)

[of here which is always a a fun thing so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m46s)

[we're going to clean this up because I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m50s)

[don't want to deal with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m52s)

[I want to keep this for a moment because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m57s)

[I have a feeling my other method](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h05m59s)

[contains that kind of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m02s)

[information uh let's see context target](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m05s)

[symbol containing type this might be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m08s)

[the the key up here so let's go up here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m11s)

[and take a look](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m16s)

[at uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m19s)

[context uh semantic model](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m21s)

[get type info well that certainly looks](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m26s)

[like something that could do what I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m29s)

[want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m35s)

[what is not no it's not in the best](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m40s)

[extension](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m43s)

[meth okay so let's let's find the actual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m45s)

[use case down here right so context](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m48s)

[do semantic](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m53s)

[semantic model get type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h06m56s)

[info uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m03s)

[info what is info](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m09s)

[here it wanted info](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m12s)

[before which was the type ARG man okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m16s)

[so we got we got to start this higher up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m19s)

[we got to start this higher up okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m21s)

[down in here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m24s)

[all I have is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m26s)

[node do I have enough information to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m28s)

[able to pull it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m31s)

[back missing is Tri raw](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m36s)

[kind SX](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m40s)

[tree I may not have enough information](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m48s)

[here that may not actually is uh so how](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m53s)

[do you check the type name because all I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h07m57s)

[want to do is a string comparison](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m00s)

[against the type name like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m02s)

[that that should not be hard once I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m04s)

[have uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m15s)

[here semantic model get type info](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m19s)

[uh where do you get the name of this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m34s)

[oh is it just right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m37s)

[there we're going to start with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m45s)

[that do that seems like the most likely](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m47s)

[explanation feels like something's wrong](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h08m52s)

[oh name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m07s)

[trivia so if we go here and look at uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m09s)

[where's the material design one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m14s)

[something like this right if we go to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m16s)

[sharab](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m19s)

[doio we'll look at something like this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m22s)

[right right and rather than iil we go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m25s)

[syntax](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m27s)

[tree right using](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m29s)

[directive attribute list because this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m38s)

[our attribute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h09m42s)

[want the name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h10m54s)

[name creates a new syntax no with all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h10m56s)

[the white space regular formatted what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h10m59s)

[for oh is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m07s)

[kind uh that's not is equivalent](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m10s)

[me okay let's go take a brief Gander](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m45s)

[back here is there any](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m49s)

[hint get semantic is Target for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m52s)

[Generation let's look at how this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m55s)

[implemented is syntax Target for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h11m59s)

[in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m13s)

[here get semantic Target for generation](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m20s)

[so you can return null out of this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m26s)

[thing you can return null](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m29s)

[limits it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m43s)

[here got it okay so I'm gonna take this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h12m50s)

[that's going to be a thing we have to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m08s)

[further](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m09s)

[down this is checking to make sure it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m11s)

[has a type expression specified on](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m13s)

[it um we do know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m18s)

[this so we can make one more filtering](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m22s)

[check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m36s)

[is type of expression](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m39s)

[syntax we can we can ensure that we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m43s)

[actually get that guy back](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m46s)

[properly so we expect a type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m49s)

[of and then the rest of this is just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m52s)

[figuring that out right so if we get to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m55s)

[here we find it now here we have to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h13m58s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m03s)

[equivalent of this guy to make sure that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m03s)

[the one that we found is in fact the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m07s)

[right one this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m09s)

[so we have this and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m13s)

[before we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m19s)

[do uh attribute syntax and can just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m22s)

[bring this guy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m25s)

[up right so this guy goes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m28s)

[here so this will give](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m35s)

[us the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m38s)

[type um and this is where I actually](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m42s)

[want to steal what I had](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m45s)

[previously because this is what we were](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m50s)

[actually checking against and so so we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m53s)

[want to grab that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h14m55s)

[information content type type name yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m00s)

[this is this is the check that we want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m04s)

[we want to invert](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m09s)

[it and return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m11s)

[early Robert welcome I'm not ignoring](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m17s)

[you by the way I saw the Ping on my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m20s)

[phone I just I was streaming so I I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m22s)

[didn't open](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m24s)

[so uh okay so this gets me my attribute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m26s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m30s)

[mobber unless of course you tell me you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m32s)

[need an answer right this moment and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m34s)

[then I can go look at it um okay so this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m35s)

[becomes you was pulling back the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m39s)

[containing type of it and getting all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m41s)

[this information and we don't care about](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m44s)

[this right so we don't need to do that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m46s)

[what we do need to do is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m49s)

[replicate the idea of check this guy in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m52s)

[here so uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m55s)

[if and we know we already got this much](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h15m59s)

[out of here so I'm comfortable with this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m02s)

[thing being a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m04s)

[cast otherwise how do we get here uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m06s)

[if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m10s)

[context just paste](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m12s)

[it uh all let's cash it I guess for a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m16s)

[moment uh bar](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m21s)

[let's call this control type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m25s)

[expression this is going to be type of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m28s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m30s)

[syntax move that down so I can see what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m32s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m34s)

[doing boom and we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m35s)

[do let's see here was just code on how](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m39s)

[to read really large Json files with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m42s)

[streams because Json converter results](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m44s)

[in an out of memory ah yes yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m46s)

[yes yeah Robert scared me earlier with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m48s)

[what I think is the largest possible](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m52s)

[Json file I have ever witnessed in real](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m53s)

[life admittedly it wasn't like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h16m59s)

[astronomically huge but typically Json](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m02s)

[is something that gets like returned](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m04s)

[from a service and so when we talk about](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m07s)

[gigabytes uh that's usually way too](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m10s)

[big if it's G to be that big it's uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m15s)

[something that uh an app serialized](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m19s)

[something massive](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m21s)

[uh okay so previously we were checking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m25s)

[the type to make sure that we could](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m28s)

[actually get the type from this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m29s)

[expression so we got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m31s)

[that and so if we go control type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m33s)

[expression this guy should have a type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m37s)

[on him yes and then we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m39s)

[want we want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m42s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m45s)

[and that goes here and then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m48s)

[if info . type is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m53s)

[null we return null and then we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h17m57s)

[bail uh notepad++ also struggles with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m01s)

[text files of two gigs so I had to get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m04s)

[past that a too interesting I wonder is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m06s)

[notepad++ a 32-bit application by any](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m10s)

[chance I wonder if that's part of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m14s)

[limitation](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m16s)

[sorry just took a drink of this Mountain](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m26s)

[Dew and it tastes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m28s)

[funny I don't think it's gone bad but it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m36s)

[doesn't taste like the last one and that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m38s)

[concerns](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m40s)

[me um okay ignoring that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m41s)

[detail uh let's see oh it wants the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m46s)

[cancellation token passed in here we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m48s)

[do that we can we can send in the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m51s)

[cancellation token we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m52s)

[I am very okay sending the token in okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m55s)

[so that gets me through there that gets](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h18m58s)

[me the type info that lets me pull all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m00s)

[this back that gets me info. type I now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m02s)

[have the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m05s)

[information](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m07s)

[uh unreachable code detected](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m18s)

[I might be missing how this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m25s)

[unreachable oh because I put my return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m34s)

[element down here this needs to oh oh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m37s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m45s)

[oh that's a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m49s)

[problem because given a single attribute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m52s)

[I need to return back a collection of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m55s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h19m58s)

[elements yeah so let's just change this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m02s)

[up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m07s)

[um because this is only going to exist](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m09s)

[in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m13s)

[here that's why it's unreachable because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m16s)

[it's saw that there was a return](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m18s)

[statement at the end of the four and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m19s)

[when you [ __ ] you can't get to this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m21s)

[right okay well you're right so stop](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m23s)

[making fun of me Visual Studio I'm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m26s)

[fixing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m27s)

[it uh okay elements gets empty and then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m28s)

[we will](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m34s)

[do return elements there and then this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m36s)

[becomes elements.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m41s)

[add right and we can put that in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m44s)

[there and what is your problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m47s)

[now nullability of thing bobber oh this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m51s)

[thing needs to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m55s)

[nullable because I'm returning null in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m57s)

[some](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h20m59s)

[cases okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m00s)

[um this dup check is not useful here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m03s)

[because this is walking up through the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m07s)

[types and it's not possible to have a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m09s)

[type be a base of itself uh notepad is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m12s)

[64bit H interesting I wonder what their](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m16s)

[limitation is then it there must be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m18s)

[something that's trying to load stuff](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m21s)

[into memory and hits limits it is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m23s)

[remarkably difficult dealing with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m26s)

[massively huge files like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m28s)

[that because I've done a bunch with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m31s)

[video files and they're like you quickly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m33s)

[find all of the places where you can't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m36s)

[just brute force your weight and be the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m38s)

[the bull in a china shop because you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m41s)

[just don't have enough memory like you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m44s)

[there used to be this mentality that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m48s)

[older developers were were smarter about](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m50s)

[memory because they had to work in more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m53s)

[memory constrained environments we've](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m55s)

[kind of swung that needle back a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m57s)

[bit with like mobile and iot and that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h21m59s)

[kind of thing where now people are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m01s)

[building in more constrainted](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m03s)

[environments but for a while I was like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m04s)

[oh no desktop apps have to be real](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m06s)

[careful about how much memory they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m07s)

[allocate and make sure that you know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m09s)

[they they aren't overusing stuff and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m11s)

[then it was like my desktop has a 128](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m12s)

[gigs whatever](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m15s)

[uh what's more allocations and that then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m17s)

[became the mentality for a while and now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m20s)

[it's kind of swinging back a little bit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m23s)

[okay so I think we've replicated this I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m26s)

[think we've handled this I don't need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m30s)

[this anymore](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m32s)

[okay that predicates it that builds it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m34s)

[that runs that that makes this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m38s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m40s)

[H now we need the thing that is going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m45s)

[dup and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m49s)

[generate so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m51s)

[get enes to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h22m55s)

[generate Okay so we've got this enum to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m00s)

[generate and then we have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m05s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m10s)

[um where is this execute method get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m13s)

[called okay so there's enums to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m17s)

[generate register Source output](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m21s)

[got it so you need a register Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m25s)

[output that takes in the the generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m27s)

[and then the the outputting bits got it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m32s)

[got it got it got it got it got it got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m34s)

[it got it makes sense because we did all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m35s)

[of this just to build up a values](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m37s)

[provider so that we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m40s)

[call this guy right elements to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m42s)

[generate and then we do this all right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m47s)

[and what are the parameters](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m50s)

[here so we've got Source production](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m52s)

[context T](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m55s)

[source and in his](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h23m57s)

[case his execute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m00s)

[method uh that's not what we're going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m04s)

[for we want to go back further down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m06s)

[sorry if I'm going fast if anybody wants](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m08s)

[to follow along at home There's the link](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m10s)

[um his looks like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m13s)

[this Source production](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m16s)

[context and then there's the null check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m20s)

[null how do you how how are we going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m25s)

[dup](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m28s)

[this oh so invalid 64 to 32-bit casting](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m41s)

[of file siiz integers yeah that'll do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m46s)

[it that'll do it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m49s)

[yeah it would be nice to be say oh well](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m56s)

[in C we don't have those problems but no](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h24m58s)

[we we can absolutely screw the exact](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m00s)

[interesting for me because I'm returning](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m05s)

[back I'm returning back a a list of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m13s)

[visual elements some of those elements](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m18s)

[are going to be things like control](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m20s)

[framework element or similar base](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m22s)

[to generate those multiple times I only](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m26s)

[want to generate them](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m28s)

[once and the problem I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m33s)

[have and I'm just GNA I'm going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m36s)

[inline this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m38s)

[sucker right because at the end of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m41s)

[day that's all this is going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m42s)

[be let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m47s)

[SPC uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m52s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m56s)

[if source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h25m59s)

[is and in this case source is going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m02s)

[be strongly typed a visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m04s)

[element right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m06s)

[uh visual](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m09s)

[elements and then thingy that generates](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m12s)

[a string that's not overly interesting](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m15s)

[right and this this actually should](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m18s)

[probably be context here right and that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m20s)

[goes there and then we need to we need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m22s)

[to actually gen this stuff so that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m25s)

[that's what exists up in my execute](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m27s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m31s)

[um and there's some diagnostic here that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m35s)

[I that I need to deal with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m39s)

[handling but then here I was able to get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m42s)

[all of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m45s)

[my generated](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m46s)

[types cuz before I got back a complete](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m49s)

[list and then this is actually the code](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m53s)

[that does the generation right so it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m54s)

[going to do blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h26m56s)

[blah if we if we want to blindly just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m03s)

[shove everything into one file or one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m06s)

[spot for the moment right so that's the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m08s)

[code there that we need that's going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m11s)

[actually write all the stuff out and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m14s)

[then the last thing that we need here is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m17s)

[the file name and then the ad Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m19s)

[right so that gets me](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m22s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m25s)

[all right so that goes there looks like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m27s)

[this add](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m30s)

[Source blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m31s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m34s)

[um let's see Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m44s)

[text from and I guess specifying an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m47s)

[encoding can't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m51s)

[hurt uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h27m52s)

[uh right so we'll do that D dun dun dun](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m01s)

[dun dun okay so that that'll gen that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m05s)

[but it still doesn't solve the fact that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m07s)

[I'm going to run](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m09s)

[into this whole thing so I can probably](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m11s)

[do the elimination of ignored types](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m18s)

[pretty easily](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m21s)

[um I don't think I can look](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m25s)

[at cuz this would actually probably save](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m30s)

[me too because I've got this check in as](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m32s)

[well I don't know why I have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m34s)

[both because this is effectively saying](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m36s)

[hey do I already have something with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m39s)

[that type but this is probably too](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m41s)

[late um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h28m45s)

[boy I'm torn on how to do this now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m04s)

[because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m06s)

[it there's not a clean way to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m08s)

[avoid if two things derve from the base](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m12s)

[my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m15s)

[uh even though we have similar problems](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m17s)

[I would 1,00% say we have things easier](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m20s)

[than C devs that's true is very true](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m22s)

[there's a lot of cheater mode things](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m25s)

[that we get like you know garbage](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m28s)

[collection a blessing and a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m31s)

[curse](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m35s)

[um how do I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m36s)

[prevent this from triggering multiple](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m43s)

[times because I need to be able to do a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m51s)

[predicate but I need the predicate to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h29m54s)

[not because I imagine what this is going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m05s)

[to do is this is an incremental values](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m07s)

[provider which means it's going to spit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m10s)

[out multiple lists of visual elements](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m12s)

[where each element uh reaches back to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m15s)

[the other](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m18s)

[ones and I need it to not hit twice on](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m19s)

[the same element](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m23s)

[how to handle](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m31s)

[uh Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m36s)

[generator uh let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m39s)

[see yeah I just I don't I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m48s)

[turns out I had to use the following](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h30m54s)

[instead wait](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m00s)

[V this is just a link problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m06s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m09s)

[um avoiding incremental](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m15s)

[problems uh use Net 7 API I for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m19s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m28s)

[ah oh this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m35s)

[is you must use okay hold on we're going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m43s)

[to put this on the side real quick let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m46s)

[take a look this this might this might](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m49s)

[make some some things easier the only](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m51s)

[reason we don't have](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m54s)

[that is because we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h31m57s)

[are where' we go what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m03s)

[what did it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m07s)

[close I I have lost the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m13s)

[website I don't know where it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m15s)

[went uh okay well it was linked in the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m22s)

[series so let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m25s)

[just okay stay there don't move](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m28s)

[um we need to be on Net 7 then in order](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m36s)

[for this to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m41s)

[work is that a problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h32m47s)

[because before I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m01s)

[was](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m08s)

[okay that is probably worth](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m09s)

[considering uh don't use syntax or I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m13s)

[symbol instances in your](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m16s)

[pipeline](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m18s)

[uh uh the generator do much more work](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m22s)

[than it should that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m25s)

[fine the next stages will always](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m32s)

[run](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m36s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m39s)

[yeah use value types or records or](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m45s)

[custom](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h33m48s)

[though](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m12s)

[oh got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m16s)

[it so the incremental value provider it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m20s)

[want something that's nicely](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m23s)

[comparable got it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m31s)

[something uh the difference is that it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m46s)

[guarantees it won't change the semantic](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h34m48s)

[that I can fix a material design thing I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h35m36s)

[okay this one is a good one to change um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h37m17s)

[it's not a drop in replacement though](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h37m20s)

[as much](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h37m41s)

[as okay but we will deal with that code](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h37m43s)

[analysis let's see what are your](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h37m45s)

[this one is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m14s)

[fine uh I think the notepad one is an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m16s)

[artifact of my current system and how I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m18s)

[have notepad set up uh Rev](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m20s)

[submit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m33s)

[uh updating](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m35s)

[config send](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m47s)

[it and then if we go there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m49s)

[and then we're going to set auto merge](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m54s)

[and let that let that sucker go okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m56s)

[so back to the whole reason this thing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h44m59s)

[started whole reason this thing started](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m02s)

[is because we've got this numeric up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m04s)

[down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m06s)

[control and I ran into a limitation when](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m07s)

[writing the UI test for it that made it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m10s)

[impossible for it to to work properly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m13s)

[and I believe the issue was around the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m16s)

[base classes where this thing had um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m18s)

[because we had decimal up down and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m23s)

[numeric up down and they both supported](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m25s)

[this up down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m27s)

[base situation](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m29s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m31s)

[um which I believe was the the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m33s)

[fundamental issue I don't remember why I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m36s)

[left the two on here that seems](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m40s)

[wrong to go through and clean that up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m42s)

[but um I believe the issue was they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m45s)

[didn't support nicely having generic](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m47s)

[bases because I couldn't do this right I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m50s)

[had numeric up down and decimal up down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m53s)

[and that's where things started to fall](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m55s)

[apart](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h45m57s)

[subscribe to myself though feels weird](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m19s)

[controls we just want to spin a couple](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m27s)

[controls that are easy to work with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m29s)

[um because it's really around the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m34s)

[generator that is what is going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m36s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m40s)

[used so is this an app test it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m43s)

[probably more in the generated](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m47s)

[test well this is generated test in that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m49s)

[it actually generates](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m53s)

[test so you sit at top the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h46m55s)

[that'll](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m01s)

[know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m08s)

[generated is is it wrong if I could do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m09s)

[generator tests feels feels weird but](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m12s)

[let's let's do it because that's that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m16s)

[functionally what we're kind of testing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m17s)

[okay so let's let's get something set up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m24s)

[that matches the the use case we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m27s)

[have so we need a uh public](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m29s)

[class uh generic base I don't know uh of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m35s)

[T and it will derive from button because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m40s)

[I don't care it just needs to derive](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m44s)

[from](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m46s)

[something yeah no need to subscribe if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m49s)

[you're there in person every stream that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m52s)

[is a good point that is excellent point](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m53s)

[uh let's see public class](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h47m56s)

[int uh button is going to be derived](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m00s)

[from generic base of int and then we are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m05s)

[going to do public class uh decimal](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m10s)

[you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m18s)

[actually you guys know you do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m21s)

[that one of those little known C syntax](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m28s)

[things that got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m31s)

[introduced that most people don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m33s)

[realize it was brought in for records](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m38s)

[because it makes positional records nice](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m41s)

[and clean and single liny uh but it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m42s)

[not limited to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m45s)

[them so that's fun uh let's see and then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m47s)

[and really all we need to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m52s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m56s)

[like uh let's see generate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h48m59s)

[helpers using examl test and then this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m03s)

[is where we want to go int](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m05s)

[button decimal button right so this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m10s)

[is this is the failure](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m14s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m41s)

[what why did that work](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m46s)

[why did that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h49m53s)

[work I thought the failure was in the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m00s)

[generator because that should](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m04s)

[have run a muck of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m08s)

[problem do I need to put something in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m12s)

[here for it to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m15s)

[Target um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m17s)

[uh let's pull that Branch](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m23s)

[again because I want to remember what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m26s)

[the issue was uh let's see numeric up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m28s)

[down yeah uh let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m31s)

[see check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m36s)

[out](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m38s)

[uh numer down dang it clearly named](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m44s)

[things too well uh let's see let's just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m48s)

[start deleting things](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m51s)

[I've got way too much stuff checked](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m53s)

[out um yeah I don't care about most of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h50m56s)

[these because most of these branches](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m00s)

[that I've checked out are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m02s)

[just things that don't matter anymore](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m04s)

[they were PR reviews or testing things](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m07s)

[or changing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m11s)

[things yeah let's just delete oh wait](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m13s)

[hang on kind of want to keep the velop](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m17s)

[pack](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m19s)

[one delete yeah there good good good](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m19s)

[good okay let's try this again numeric](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m22s)

[up down check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m25s)

[out numeric up down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m28s)

[there already](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m32s)

[exists oh did I dang I didn't delete the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m34s)

[one that I actually needed to so the one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m38s)

[branch that was causing me the issue is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m41s)

[the one that I didn't delete that was](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m43s)

[dumb let's try again numeric up down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m46s)

[because picking a different name for the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m49s)

[branch is clearly not something that I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m51s)

[know how to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m52s)

[do okay so let's go here and let's take](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m54s)

[a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m57s)

[look what is what is going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h51m58s)

[on and this is probably an artifact of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m06s)

[the fact that I did this like months ago](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m09s)

[and can't remember that far](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m11s)

[back okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m20s)

[okay so specifically it was that last](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m26s)

[file in the pr that we had left](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m29s)

[commented the test base and UI test yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m31s)

[it's not here it's here test base this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m35s)

[is the line that doesn't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m39s)

[work why does this line not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m40s)

[work there is a bug here and I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m45s)

[know what it is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m48s)

[I'm going to feel really bad if the bug](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m57s)

[was already fixed and I just didn't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h52m59s)

[publish a release or something that's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m01s)

[going to make me feel real](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m03s)

[stupid so I'm wondering if I just need](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m11s)

[to have like an attached property or](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m13s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m15s)

[yeah so this thing died out but I think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m27s)

[the key thing is going to be in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m31s)

[here uh it will not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m37s)

[contribute element generator failed to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m39s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m42s)

[Source up down base to generate uh must](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m47s)

[be be unique within a generator okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m52s)

[that's that's the issue is it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m54s)

[generating duplicate output](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m56s)

[names because it didn't appropriately](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h53m59s)

[dedup itself that is the that is the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m01s)

[kicker right so that is the bug so I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m04s)

[probably just need an attached property](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m09s)

[or](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m11s)

[something uh wait there's an attached](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m12s)

[avalonia](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m15s)

[property](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m19s)

[sorry small](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m20s)

[distraction um I have been playing with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m23s)

[avalonia recently and I keep discovering](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m26s)

[things that make me very happy and it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m28s)

[been a wonderful wonderful](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m30s)

[experience uh let's see so prop](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m33s)

[dependency uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m36s)

[T](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m38s)

[value and we'll just do that this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m40s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m44s)

[body uh use expression](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m46s)

[body uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m49s)

[base all right and then this will be uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m54s)

[default of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m58s)

[T okay does that cause it to fail well](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h54m59s)

[because one of these guys is going to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m03s)

[it I just need to figure out](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m05s)

[who](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m07s)

[okay there see now we have a failure so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m12s)

[all I needed to do was get a a property](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m15s)

[in the generic](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m18s)

[based that it then registers on okay so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m19s)

[now we debug The Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m23s)

[generator so let's put a breako here I'm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m30s)

[kind of interested in seeing and the the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m33s)

[simplest way to debug a source generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m35s)

[is to do this is you literally just do a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m38s)

[debugger](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m40s)

[launch and then when you get this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m41s)

[obnoxious thing that pops you launch in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m44s)

[and you are now debugging your Source](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m48s)

[generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m51s)

[okay so here we go so let's let's find](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m53s)

[it because we are now halfway through](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m57s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h55m59s)

[process okay generated types we have 94](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m00s)

[generated types that is a lot of types](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m03s)

[and we are looking for it's probably](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m06s)

[going to be near the end I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m09s)

[imagine](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m12s)

[uh we are looking for the ones for our](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m14s)

[new control](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m17s)

[hopefully these are in some semblance of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m22s)

[order but it looks like the answer is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m24s)

[they are in a completely random order](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m26s)

[which is excellent I was worried it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m29s)

[would make sense and be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m30s)

[simple uh is this for the gooey](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m32s)

[uh well sort of so this is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m37s)

[generating I go back over here to the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m41s)

[material design to to show its usage so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m44s)

[when writing uh UI tests this generate](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m48s)

[helpers will look at all of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m53s)

[dependency properties on the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m55s)

[control and generate out uh helper](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h56m57s)

[methods for that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m01s)

[control the the problem we're running](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m02s)

[into here is both decimal up down and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m05s)

[numeric up down have a common Base Class](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m07s)

[that's generic and my generator is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m09s)

[choking on that so this is for UI](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m12s)

[testing the guey but yes I I I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m16s)

[know if that was quite what you were](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m19s)

[going for the question but yes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m21s)

[um and specifically we are looking for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m23s)

[INT button and decimal button and I'm](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m26s)

[really really tempted to name them](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m29s)

[differently just so that I can find them](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m32s)

[easier they should be in this list](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m35s)

[somewhere and there should be generic](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m38s)

[button in this list as](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m41s)

[well what do I know I I'm just a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m42s)

[developer uh in Python uh struggling](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m47s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m51s)

[yeah and I will say it like UI based](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m53s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m57s)

[is not always trivial right I think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h57m58s)

[um uh Simplicity versus feature yeah I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m03s)

[will say I have if you are diving into](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m07s)

[C it depends on how how much you want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m10s)

[bite off all at once I am very biased](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m13s)

[towards my own project](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m17s)

[templates um un unlike a lot of project](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m20s)

[templates that are out there um they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m23s)

[they tend to be very generic and not](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m27s)

[share a lot with you um I try to make my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m29s)

[templates a little more opinionated um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m33s)

[towards my own personal preferences of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m35s)

[what I think is good um yeah inside a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m37s)

[Docker container so I'm struggling with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m42s)

[net uh and running into the Linux](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m44s)

[ecosystems yeah there are a handful of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m47s)

[things and you have to be a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m49s)

[careful with examples you find online](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m52s)

[because C has been around for a lot](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m54s)

[longer than C has been crossplatform and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m57s)

[so you'll find some code that's very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h58m59s)

[very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m01s)

[bad um specifically around like file](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m02s)

[paths you'll see people just straight](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m06s)

[hardcode back slashes into them and and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m07s)

[that just doesn't work in Linux right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m11s)

[the I mean the solution is simple you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m13s)

[just switch to a forward slash and the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m15s)

[problem goes away or even better you use](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m16s)

[something like U path. combine where it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m18s)

[figures out the appropriate slashes for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m21s)

[you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m23s)

[but yeah there there is a a quite a bit](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m24s)

[of an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m28s)

[issue um if you're Building inside of a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m29s)

[Docker container are you trying to build](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m33s)

[a UI inside of a Docker container or are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m36s)

[you deving inside of a doer](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m38s)

[container](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m41s)

[um yeah I launched the the gooey from](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m46s)

[Docker got it okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m49s)

[interesting um the one thing I would](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m53s)

[point you to and again I'm biased but I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=01h59m56s)

[have really enjoyed avalonia recently](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m00s)

[so this guy here um it works on Linux it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m05s)

[works um in a variety of places um and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m10s)

[if you want a starting template of where](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m14s)

[to to go um I do have uh an avalonia](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m17s)

[solution as part of myet templates so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m22s)

[it's I will say this is my newest](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m25s)

[template and there is more that I want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m27s)

[to add to it and it is it is I think it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m30s)

[is good and work uh and works in its](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m33s)

[current state I think there's more that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m35s)

[should be done but yeah so if you want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m37s)

[it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m40s)

[the so there's the link to the repo um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m41s)

[if you want to get started it's uh here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m46s)

[I can just show you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m49s)

[grab a window](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m52s)

[here so make](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m54s)

[iter example](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h00m57s)

[avalonia and then you run something like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m00s)

[net new install](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m02s)

[templates and then you have various](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m06s)

[templates created which this one is the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m09s)

[one that we want so we'll go](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m12s)

[CD uh what did I call it example](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m14s)

[avalonia](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m18s)

[yeah if we just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m20s)

[and then net](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m24s)

[new you have to spell](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m27s)

[correctly uh is it possible to code net](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m33s)

[into one giant file yes uh you will see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m36s)

[very few people do it but it is possible](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m39s)

[to put all of like all of your C into](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m42s)

[one file I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m44s)

[think unlike python where it's more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m47s)

[scripted and interpreted](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m50s)

[um I think the smallest you can possibly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m52s)

[get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m55s)

[um uh I think you're going to end up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m57s)

[with one C file and one project file is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h01m59s)

[the smallest you can get down to because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m03s)

[at the end of the day um C is compiled](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m05s)

[and you need the project file to tell it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m09s)

[like what SDK to build with and that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m12s)

[kind of thing um the other option is if](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m15s)

[you're looking for something that may be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m19s)

[a little more Akin to uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m20s)

[oh yeah the problem is I recognize I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m24s)

[said uh oh because I recognize this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m27s)

[article because that's my that's my boss](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m28s)

[um there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m34s)

[the you can get C to kind of behave like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m37s)

[a scripting language a little bit where](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m40s)

[it's a little closer to python where](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m43s)

[it's uh just a one C file it's a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m46s)

[more complex to do um but you can do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m50s)

[something something of this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m54s)

[nature uh it changed the output](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h02m59s)

[sometimes it get](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m02s)

[a yeah and and I will say like the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m05s)

[avalonia stuff is not going to be single](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m08s)

[file there's a lot of once you start](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m10s)

[targeting particular platforms you often](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m12s)

[times need extra stuff to go along with](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m14s)

[it like for example if you start](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m17s)

[targeting Android Android has a bunch of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m18s)

[EXT EXT ra files that it expects you to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m21s)

[provide in addition to like your C file](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m23s)

[your manifest and whatnot but if you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m26s)

[want to there's nothing stopping you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m29s)

[from putting all of your C classes into](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m31s)

[a single file like you can see this one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m34s)

[here I've got one two three four five](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m36s)

[separate classes all just in one file um](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m40s)

[but yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m43s)

[so the files in C are there for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m45s)

[organization](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m48s)

[uh so it is definitely possible to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m52s)

[collapse everything into one whether you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m54s)

[should or not is definitely a point of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m56s)

[debate but can you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h03m57s)

[yes uh okay so the problem I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m04s)

[though is I don't see](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m07s)

[my thing here so we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m10s)

[faru gets RX generated types order](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m13s)

[by X do oh no where's the the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m18s)

[name names space](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m23s)

[type uh full](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m26s)

[name to list there I don't want to think](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m28s)

[real](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m33s)

[hard I he yeah I will say you the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m39s)

[freedom Mando you will run into people](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m44s)

[who are 100% opposed to the single file](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m46s)

[thing largely because they've been](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m49s)

[written on various](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m51s)

[projects for small things that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m53s)

[are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m57s)

[um like individual projects like I will](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h04m58s)

[say this even like simple little console](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m01s)

[applications I am perfectly guilty of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m03s)

[putting everything in one file but it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m05s)

[because they're small and manageable and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m07s)

[it doesn't bother](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m11s)

[me so it definitely depends on what you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m12s)

[are](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m15s)

[doing okay now we should be able to find](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m16s)

[these](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m19s)

[suckers uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m20s)

[uh okay so these are system system](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m22s)

[system system](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m25s)

[system uh let's see oh I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m27s)

[zaml test so I'm going to be down near](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m29s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m30s)

[bottom none of these](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m32s)

[are my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m36s)

[type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m39s)

[what did I did I miss something obvious](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m41s)

[am I an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m45s)

[idiot type. type type. name am I am I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m49s)

[just looking at this thing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m54s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h05m57s)

[um type do type.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m02s)

[name is this thing got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m06s)

[to I'm huh why why do I see none of my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m13s)

[own classes in here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m18s)

[like there's the sum total of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m25s)

[eyes and I know I have int](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m29s)

[button what the heck is going](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m32s)

[on I don't see any](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m38s)

[decimals](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m42s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m50s)

[the other thing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m52s)

[uh uh freedom is often times depending](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m54s)

[on what you're looking at some IDE](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h06m57s)

[actually try to make it easier to deal](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m00s)

[with some of the navigation problems](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m02s)

[across multiple files like control F is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m03s)

[nice but uh visual studio and writer](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m07s)

[both have things that are uh more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m10s)

[syntactically aware so rather than it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m14s)

[just being a simple GP based approach](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m17s)

[you can say okay I actually want to find](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m20s)

[a type that has the following you know](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m22s)

[substring in the name or similar which](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m25s)

[is potentially worth looking](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m27s)

[at](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m29s)

[um I am very very very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m32s)

[confused](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m38s)

[wait what if I type full name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m47s)

[oh I'm getting bit by okay hang on hang](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m55s)

[on hang on I'm getting bit by that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h07m58s)

[that's what's biting me okay okay let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m01s)

[try this again rinse](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m04s)

[repeat let's see cancel the first one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m08s)

[grab the second](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m10s)

[one there we](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m14s)

[go okay I think that uh shoot stop that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m17s)

[execution sorry I I only know this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m24s)

[because it's whenever it jumps into this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m27s)

[uh miscellaneous file it means it's got](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m29s)

[the old version that it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m31s)

[compiling](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m35s)

[stop rebuild the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m37s)

[generator there we go now rebuild the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m40s)

[test which will prompt the de the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m44s)

[generator to run which prompts the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m47s)

[debugger which says attach and We're Off](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m48s)

[to the Races](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m50s)

[there we go and now we're looking at the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m52s)

[the updated file okay that takes me to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m55s)

[there that takes me to there I should](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h08m58s)

[just move my breakpoint down to where I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m00s)

[actually care to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m02s)

[stop okay let's take a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m03s)

[look uh let's see int](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m06s)

[button I still don't see it in this list](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m13s)

[I okay I am I am missing something so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m31s)

[we're g to we're going to just run until](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m34s)

[we see an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m37s)

[exception no](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m41s)

[exception attach](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m46s)

[the wrong](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m51s)

[one wrong](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m54s)

[one okay there it hit the argument](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h09m58s)

[exception I want to see this list oh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m03s)

[it's because it's running for different](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m08s)

[projects and I'm looking at the wrong oh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m10s)

[that's why I'm not seeing it that's why](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m12s)

[I'm not seen it see look at that that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m15s)

[that now has](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m17s)

[it okay this now makes a little more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m19s)

[sense so there's generic base it's in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m22s)

[here twice it has generic base of full](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m25s)

[name of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m30s)

[that and the problem is when it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m32s)

[generating the file name it's just using](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m35s)

[type. name which is now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m38s)

[duplicated and is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m41s)

[problematic so let's stop that for a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m44s)

[moment you shut up yeah yeah yeah shut](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m48s)

[up shut up set up that's the problem](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m50s)

[okay so where all is this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m52s)

[used okay so that's my order bu that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m55s)

[doesn't matter because that was just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h10m59s)

[there for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m00s)

[debugging there is the name of the class](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m01s)

[so it has to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m05s)

[be a type friendly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m07s)

[name right because it's going to it's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m11s)

[going to check it on the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m13s)

[class uh let's see where's my where's my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m17s)

[other ones so yeah so there's the check](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m19s)

[there the check there and then it's used](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m22s)

[on the file name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m23s)

[so we need the name to be generated but](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m25s)

[we need the name to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m29s)

[be including the generic type if it is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m31s)

[there and in this case it will be there](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m37s)

[and we can grab](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m41s)

[it see so if we go here see at least all](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m46s)

[of that work that we did to try to go to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m50s)

[an incremental generator now is paying](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m51s)

[off because we can pick this up uh let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m53s)

[see type.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m56s)

[name where is type. name coming in from](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h11m57s)

[we're going to update a little bit of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m00s)

[this code while we're in here because I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m01s)

[can't stand](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m03s)

[it so this is typ symbol. name but this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m04s)

[it this needs to be a little](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m08s)

[more](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m10s)

[uh this needs to be a little different](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m13s)

[here so we're going to need to catch it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m18s)

[when we run against the other](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m21s)

[project we're going to need to pick it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m24s)

[up down](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m26s)

[lower we're going to rebuild](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m28s)

[this and then this generator is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h12m34s)

[missed okay I just want to I want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m29s)

[look at the one that is actually being](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m31s)

[used okay so in an effort to make this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m33s)

[not suck how can I turn](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m36s)

[off generation of these things because](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m39s)

[what I really want to do is kill usages](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m44s)

[of that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m46s)

[attribute so I I think what we can do is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m49s)

[we can turn this off which will save me](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m51s)

[a little pain and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h14m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m06s)

[um think we can do this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m10s)

[here actually I guess if I do that I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m13s)

[don't need to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m15s)

[up](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m20s)

[and now the attribute should only be on](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m22s)

[for the one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m24s)

[project and I shouldn't hit any debug or](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m29s)

[launch statements here I still](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m32s)

[did](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m35s)

[okay why are you proing do you reference](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m39s)

[something else that's doing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m43s)

[it then we'll test generator](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m47s)

[why do you still show a dependency](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m55s)

[on saml test generator didn't I just](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h15m58s)

[comment you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m01s)

[out](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m03s)

[nope that's that's the explanation for](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m09s)

[one okay die there now you're gone now I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m10s)

[should be able to rebuild you without](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m16s)

[that thing](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m17s)

[popping cuz I only want to debug the one](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m19s)

[project okay that guy's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m21s)

[fine now if we go here and I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m25s)

[launch I should pick up the change I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m30s)

[should only be on the one project I care](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m33s)

[about obviously things aren't going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m37s)

[work](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m39s)

[properly okay it still shows](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m41s)

[miscellaneous file why do you have an](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m43s)

[old version of this](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m46s)

[so I don't want to be broken here I want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h16m58s)

[to grab it where it's generating](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m01s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m07s)

[yeah I want to grab it why do you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m09s)

[not you not have a direct](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m14s)

[dependency uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m18s)

[no test generators output](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m22s)

[type reference output assembly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m27s)

[false](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m31s)

[yeah if I rebuild](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m34s)

[you and then I rebuild the test it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m37s)

[should pick up a new version of that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m40s)

[assembly I'm wondering if like net test](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m43s)

[is being held open and I just need to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m46s)

[kill off some processes](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m49s)

[yeah I'm wondering if there's a running](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m51s)

[process that's gone Rogue on](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m54s)

[me](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h17m57s)

[uh like one of these long running](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m01s)

[things come on and task and task and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m05s)

[task nope stop helping me you know what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m10s)

[where's my](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m13s)

[terminal uh let's see task kill I am](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m16s)

[build.](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m21s)

[exe there that'll and then while we're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m22s)

[at](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m25s)

[it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m28s)

[okay so the problem when you're building](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m37s)

[the system that you're debugging and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m40s)

[you're debugging the build](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m42s)

[system very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m44s)

[circular why](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m49s)

[okay let's stop you for the moment let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m52s)

[just reboot Visual Studio yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m54s)

[yeah I understand you are unhappy you](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h18m57s)

[don't like me I'm going to shut down the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m00s)

[material design one too just because I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m03s)

[know you guys like to keep running](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m06s)

[processes sitting around and that's very](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m08s)

[not nice right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m09s)

[now](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m17s)

[okay just want to debug the one process](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m19s)

[why is this so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m22s)

[hard suppose I could move it into the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m24s)

[other project that's that's another](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m26s)

[workaround I guess it's not the work](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m28s)

[around I want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m31s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m32s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m34s)

[cancel to rebuild the generator just to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m36s)

[make absolutely](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m39s)

[certain I've got debug I've got design](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m41s)

[time builds that are proing left and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m44s)

[right which is annoying](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m45s)

[okay restore your new get packages I](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h19m52s)

[okay oh wait okay you're](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m04s)

[fine and then if I rebuild](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m08s)

[you make sure my break Point's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m12s)

[persisted it's that one but I want to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m16s)

[actually grab it in the syntax receiver](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m18s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m20s)

[okay now if we debug](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m21s)

[in misscellaneous file what the heck](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m27s)

[where are you getting your assembly](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m30s)

[from uh debug](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h20m33s)

[see I named type is what I'm after yeah](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m24s)

[so I want](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m28s)

[that there for when I lose it now I've](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m30s)

[moment okay so what we would like to do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m46s)

[down here is get the type name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m48s)

[right so uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m51s)

[string string](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h25m59s)

[uh safe type name gets type. name right](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m01s)

[we're going to do that and](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m08s)

[then uh let's see let's](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m11s)

[do save type name yeah and then](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m15s)

[if uh type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m22s)

[dot uh](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m27s)

[I I name type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m30s)

[symbol name](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m32s)

[symbol uh and actually I guess we can](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m36s)

[go here and say if the type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h26m39s)

[ugly do that do that do](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h28m38s)

[that does that work so we are going to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h28m41s)

[prepend and underscore if we are a](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h28m44s)

[the generic type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h28m49s)

[get their save type](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h28m50s)

[what good is yet like this is one of the](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m38s)

[things that I I I've struggled with like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m41s)

[you don't really want full CD out to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m44s)

[like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m48s)

[Apple and Google Play because they both](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m50s)

[discourage you from doing like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m53s)

[publishing on that kind of cadence they](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m54s)

[want like a nightly or or similar](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m56s)

[because they're like oh you don't really](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h39m58s)

[day if you don't have to it's like well](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m01s)

[yeah but I want to still be able to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m03s)

[trigger quickly when I want to go so](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m05s)

[it's like how do you then version it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m06s)

[and yeah I haven't decided what I like](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m10s)

[yet right now it's a two-step process](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m12s)

[but it's a two-step process that's only](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m15s)

[a few clicks](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m17s)

[good enough for now okay so once that](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m20s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m26s)

[button let's see enable auto merge](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m44s)

[confirm Auto merge once this goes in](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m46s)

[I think then all I need to do is](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m50s)

[Rev oh do I not version it inside of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m55s)

[here I version it entirely inside of](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h40m58s)

[this yeah so it's just the base version](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m02s)

[that needs to](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m04s)

[rev because otherwise it runs entirely](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m08s)

[off the tag so what have I tagged what](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m11s)

[have I that's been so long I I don't](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m14s)

[going to pull it in on that branch on](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m37s)

[the material design project and give it](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m38s)

[a a test to see that it actually works](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m40s)

[because hopefully it just just works but](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m43s)

[I also read all those nougat packages](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m47s)

[and we we got to change the incremental](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m48s)

[Source generator so there's going to be](https://youtu.be/aBamVtIqiy0?t=02h41m50s)
