[here yeah sure fine we can rev those](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m13s)

[those should probably be revved in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m15s)

[template anyway which probably means my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m17s)

[template needs](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m18s)

[a a version kick since I believe those](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m20s)

[things are actually already checked into](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m23s)

[my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m25s)

[template okay anyway moving on okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m26s)

[latest one so we've got material design](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m29s)

[installed and then the key Parts here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m31s)

[are on the app. zaml bringing in some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m34s)

[sort of theme because if you don't bring](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m37s)

[in any sort of color theme you will lack](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m39s)

[coloring and things will not look right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m41s)

[and that's just bad uh and then this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m44s)

[resource dictionary here brings in all](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m46s)

[of the default](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m49s)

[styling that's it you're off to the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m50s)

[races this thing here is just showing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m52s)

[off uh an implicit style for a checkbox](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m54s)

[though there isn't a checkbox in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m57s)

[thing wondering why I left this in my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h05m58s)

[template should probably kill](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m00s)

[it um but it is showing how you can make](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m02s)

[all of your check boxes default to the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m05s)

[accent color one instead of the main one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m07s)

[so not bad okay uh so uh inside of here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m09s)

[do we even have the material design](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m15s)

[thing I don't think we do so let's just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m16s)

[grab the namespace](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m18s)

[include grab the namespace include bippy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m21s)

[boy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m24s)

[booya okay so we will do material design](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m25s)

[colon drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m29s)

[host okay so the drawer host itself is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m32s)

[intended to be used as a uh content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m36s)

[control meaning there should probably be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m39s)

[some content inside of your drawer host](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m42s)

[now the the drawer host is you can kind](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m45s)

[of think of it as the control that you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m49s)

[would use if you wanted flyy outs coming](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m51s)

[in from the sides now you got left right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m53s)

[top bottom so if we take a look at the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m56s)

[drawer host here here you'll note that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h06m58s)

[there is if we look at left you'll see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m00s)

[there's a whole bunch of options around](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m03s)

[the left drawer there's similar things](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m04s)

[if we do something on right right drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m06s)

[content click away string format content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m09s)

[template template selector Corner radius](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m12s)

[all of that stuff so uh I think the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m14s)

[common ones that people like to do are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m17s)

[left and right so we're going to focus](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m18s)

[on those um and inside of our lovely](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m20s)

[stack panel uh let's just do a button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m23s)

[here button uh content uh open left](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m25s)

[right so we will do that and then we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m31s)

[need to actually put some content in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m33s)

[these drawers so that there's something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m36s)

[to see because if all you do is put a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m37s)

[drawer host in by itself you've set up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m39s)

[this container that has flyouts](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m41s)

[available but you haven't put any](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m43s)

[content in the fly outs so entire inside](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m45s)

[of zaml we use what is called uh element](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m48s)

[syntax so you'll note here left drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m51s)

[content and then for here we're just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m54s)

[going to do maybe a stack panel give it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m56s)

[a width of 300 just so that there's some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h07m58s)

[some size there stack panels default to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m03s)

[Vertical orientation uh and then we'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m06s)

[do you know uh text block](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m08s)

[text hello on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m11s)

[left and then we're going to go through](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m15s)

[here and do a button content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m17s)

[close Okay so we're going to start here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m21s)

[now the first thing that's important to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m24s)

[know uh know to do is how might we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m26s)

[about actually opening a drawer host and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m29s)

[there's a couple ways you can uh go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m32s)

[about doing it if you wish to control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m34s)

[the opening and closing of your drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m38s)

[host from your view model which is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m40s)

[somewhat common uh you might do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m42s)

[something like is left drawer open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m44s)

[binding is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m47s)

[left uh drawer open right and then in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m50s)

[your view model we could create an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m53s)

[observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m55s)

[property let's see observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h08m58s)

[property uh private bu is left come on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m01s)

[co-pilot there you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m07s)

[go missed it okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m09s)

[boom and then for this command here what](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m13s)

[we might do is we might go command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m16s)

[binding uh Open Drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m19s)

[Command right and then we might come in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m24s)

[here and we might create a little relay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m26s)

[command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m28s)

[really command oh you going to do it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m30s)

[co-pilot you going to do it oh you so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m31s)

[close you so close no no you were so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m35s)

[close Okay and we're we're just going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m40s)

[set it to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m42s)

[True okay so what we have an observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m43s)

[property of type bu a command that can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m48s)

[set it to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m51s)

[true and then over here we have our is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m52s)

[left or open flag bound to that property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h09m56s)

[with some content in our left drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m00s)

[let's try it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m02s)

[out compiling compiling](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m09s)

[compiling okay so we see here we go open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m15s)

[left and we can see that the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m19s)

[slides over why the heck are we so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m21s)

[oh because previously my stack panel was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m27s)

[in Grid Row](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m30s)

[one and now I wrapped it in a drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m31s)

[hose so step one don't be an idiot the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m33s)

[top level element of my window is a grid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m37s)

[the grid has some rows oops not don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m39s)

[drag and drop text thank you uh grid has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m42s)

[some rows my menu is in my top row my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m45s)

[drawer host is expected to fill the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m47s)

[second row which is set to height of one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m49s)

[star which fills the remaining content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m52s)

[okay now when we open it now the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m54s)

[important thing to note here the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m56s)

[is is not covering my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h10m58s)

[menu right so the drawer host only](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m00s)

[covers up the content contained within](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m03s)

[it this is very similar to how the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m06s)

[dialog host works whatever you want it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m08s)

[to cover you put inside of it now often](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m10s)

[that means that uh like the dialogue](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m13s)

[host your drawer host is going to sit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m15s)

[usually near the top of your zaml](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m18s)

[because you know yeah you could use it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m20s)

[at more nested levels but typically](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m22s)

[these are things that are kind of more](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m25s)

[windy level um so often times it's not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m26s)

[uncommon to see like maybe dialog host](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m30s)

[inside of dialog host contain a drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m32s)

[host and then inside of that you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m34s)

[actually get to your real content just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m36s)

[kind of laying out that um overlay of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m38s)

[where do you want these things to go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m41s)

[right and you'll know by default when I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m43s)

[just click on the uh the grade out area](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m46s)

[over here poof goes away right this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m48s)

[some people will call it close on click](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m52s)

[away light dismiss Etc so that guy here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m54s)

[is uh uh what is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h11m58s)

[it uh left dra close on click away](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m00s)

[defaults to true if I go false now when](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m03s)

[I open it if I click off I got nothing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m06s)

[nothing no closing and this button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m10s)

[obviously hasn't been wired up to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m12s)

[anything so it doesn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m13s)

[work right so this guy doesn't do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m15s)

[anything and away we go so this is kind](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m18s)

[of option one and things to consider so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m21s)

[by default the the light dismiss the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m24s)

[close on click away is set to true if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m26s)

[you do not like that behavior set it to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m29s)

[false for the relevant drawers there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m31s)

[isn't a kind of overarching one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m33s)

[because sometimes people want to control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m37s)

[individual ones it's not too uncommon to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m39s)

[have especially when using the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m42s)

[host like the left and rights some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m43s)

[people will use like the top and bottom](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m46s)

[to bring notifications in and so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m47s)

[sometimes you want that light dismiss](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m49s)

[different depending on what you're doing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m51s)

[um also note if you're using the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m54s)

[host to bring something in on the bottom](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m56s)

[you might take a look at the snack bar](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m58s)

[because if you're looking for kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h12m59s)

[that um toast notification feel it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m01s)

[probably the controller you're after](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m04s)

[rather than a drawer host you can do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m06s)

[with a drawer host it's just snack Bar's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m07s)

[got a lot of freebies for you uh that'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m09s)

[make it a little bit simpler the other](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m12s)

[thing uh I want to call attention to is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m14s)

[the fact that I set this width to 300](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m16s)

[here now if I don't do this width](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m18s)

[300 what ends up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m20s)

[happening is my my drawer is now going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m23s)

[to shrink in size to contain my content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m26s)

[so whatever whatever that width is going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m29s)

[to be now you can push it out with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m31s)

[margins and whatnot um however what I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m33s)

[have found is often times I very much](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m36s)

[want to be controlling the size of these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m39s)

[things and not let the content dictate](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m42s)

[so for example if I wanted to force this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m44s)

[text to wrap uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m47s)

[something uh really long that really](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m50s)

[needs to wrap right and we'll go with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m55s)

[uh text wrapping wrap all right so if we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h13m59s)

[do something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m03s)

[this right you'll note this is no longer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m05s)

[wrapping for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m07s)

[me and it's because that drawer is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m08s)

[wanting to size to itself so sometimes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m11s)

[you really don't want to let uh your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m13s)

[drawers default the to the content if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m16s)

[you have any amount of dynamic content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m19s)

[if you don't have Dynamic content and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m21s)

[you want to not worry about it fine](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m23s)

[great have at it right but just be aware](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m26s)

[that it is going to uh go through and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m28s)

[try and do it versus if you do something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m30s)

[like uh width 200 right now you're going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m33s)

[to force the the maximum size of your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m37s)

[text block to only get to there it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m40s)

[going to wrap you could obviously do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m41s)

[that at the text Block Level instead if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m43s)

[you didn't want to do it up above](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m45s)

[whatever right just the the the big idea](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m47s)

[here is making sure that when you are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m49s)

[working with your drawer host that you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m53s)

[are actually aware that the drawers](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m56s)

[themselves are going to size the content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h14m58s)

[unless you do something uh else about it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m00s)

[okay let's talk about this close button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m04s)

[so uh one possible implementation is we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m06s)

[could wire this guy up to another](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m08s)

[command inside of our view model and go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m10s)

[through and say okay you know we'll set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m13s)

[the bound property back to false but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m15s)

[sometimes we don't actually care to have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m18s)

[a backing view model property this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m20s)

[actually not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m23s)

[needed so it's needed this this bound](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m24s)

[property is only needed if you want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m28s)

[control it from The View model for some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m30s)

[reason maybe you've got you know a web](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m32s)

[service call or a database lookup and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m34s)

[once that completes you want to bring](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m36s)

[the fly out open great fine buying the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m37s)

[property have at it you're in complete](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m40s)

[control however a common use case is I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m41s)

[clicky button drawer opens I light](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m45s)

[dismiss drawer closes if that's the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m48s)

[behavior you're after or maybe you uh or](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m51s)

[maybe you want the button to explicitly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m53s)

[close it there is a concept in WPS](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m55s)

[called a routed command so let's take a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h15m58s)

[look at that so a routed command and in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m01s)

[this case it's going to be under](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m03s)

[material uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m06s)

[design drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m08s)

[host uh what is it close close drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m13s)

[command okay and then this guy actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m17s)

[takes a command parameter and this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m20s)

[going to be uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m23s)

[xstatic uh uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m27s)

[doc left so the drawer host internally](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m30s)

[is implemented with a dra let's try that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m34s)

[again the drawer host internally is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m36s)

[implemented with a dock panel a dock](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m39s)

[panel has this little dock](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m42s)

[enum and rather than rebuilding this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m45s)

[exact enom ourselves we just reused the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m48s)

[one that was already implemented however](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m51s)

[and I will be the first to acknowledge](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m53s)

[knowing that you need to leverage this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m55s)

[may not be the the most](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m57s)

[intuitive just th just throw that out](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h16m59s)

[there right may not be the most](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m01s)

[intuitive but it kind of conceptually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m03s)

[makes sense when you think of a drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m06s)

[host as having the four drawers coming](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m08s)

[in from the sides the drawers are often](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m09s)

[seen as flyy outs people will often](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m11s)

[refer to them as being docked Left Right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m13s)

[top bottom great kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m15s)

[works so we abuse this guy here so if we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m19s)

[take a look at this guy now when I hit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m22s)

[close it now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m25s)

[closes right so I can open left close I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m27s)

[did nothing in the view model right so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m31s)

[how does this routed command actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m34s)

[end up working for that let's take a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m36s)

[look at the actual material design in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m38s)

[zaml](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m40s)

[project uh because I think this I think](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m41s)

[oftentimes people get confused with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m44s)

[routed commands uh and I kind of just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m46s)

[want to show the implementation of them](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m48s)

[okay so here is the drawer host control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m51s)

[and the routed commands are implemented](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m54s)

[as public](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m57s)

[static](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h17m59s)

[Fields okay public static Fields not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m00s)

[properties public static fields and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m03s)

[you'll know when we referenced it in our](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m06s)

[code over here we used the ecstatic to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m08s)

[say that we were going after it and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m10s)

[there's our our name space our class](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m11s)

[name and then our Our member name and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m14s)

[that assigns it here but you'll know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m17s)

[when we set these things up we're just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m20s)

[calling new there's nothing fancy about](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m22s)

[this at all the question then is where](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m24s)

[does the implementation of this come](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m27s)

[from and with a routed command the big](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m30s)

[idea is there is a separation between](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m32s)

[the control that raises the command and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m36s)

[the control that handles the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m40s)

[command in our case the control that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m42s)

[raises the command is going to be this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m45s)

[button and the control that we would](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m48s)

[like to handle this command is going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m50s)

[be the drawer host now the the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m52s)

[host very conveniently in its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m55s)

[Constructor](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m57s)

[defaults to setting up handlers for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h18m59s)

[these commands now if you wanted to use](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m01s)

[a routed command elsewhere that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m03s)

[totally fine but you'll note it's got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m05s)

[this drawer uh closed drawer command uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m07s)

[as the first parameter and then this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m10s)

[Handler over](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m12s)

[here so you'll not when it gets in here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m13s)

[there's some event args a sender a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m16s)

[pattern that you're probably familiar](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m18s)

[with and you'll note here this thing is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m19s)

[explicitly looking for a parameter of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m22s)

[type doc that's the the enum we looked](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m24s)

[at a moment ago and if it finds it it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m26s)

[says Ah okay here's what we're going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m29s)

[do we're going to we're going to trigger](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m31s)

[the on drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m33s)

[closing uh give give people an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m34s)

[opportunity to cancel it if they want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m37s)

[and then we're going to go ahead and set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m39s)

[the open flag to false and we're just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m41s)

[going to straight up close that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m44s)

[drawer right and so that then flows all](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m46s)

[the way in here you'll note the set open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m50s)

[flag looks for the dock parameter uh I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m52s)

[guess I did fail to mention that if you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m55s)

[don't set the do do parameter it's just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m57s)

[going to do all of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h19m59s)

[them so if you wanted to just close all](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m01s)

[drawers boom you can just do this which](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m06s)

[in our case we only have one drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m09s)

[right now they're functionally the same](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m11s)

[I generally don't like doing the don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m14s)

[pass the parameter option um because if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m16s)

[you add a drawer in later you Pro this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m19s)

[is probably now accidental Behavior not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m21s)

[intentional Behavior I prefer to set it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m23s)

[but to each his own have fun](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m26s)

[so but that's the idea with routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m29s)

[commands now when you end up uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m31s)

[executing this command what happens is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m33s)

[the the command will fire and the routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m36s)

[command will walk up through your zaml](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m38s)

[up through the visual tree looking for a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m42s)

[Handler if it doesn't find a Handler it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m45s)

[will go ahead and do nothing so for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m48s)

[example if we were to go over here right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m50s)

[and go uh how](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m53s)

[about we'll do close over over here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m56s)

[right if we do this guy just bring him](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h20m59s)

[up we take a look here uh let's relaunch](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m04s)

[this guy real quick because I don't I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m08s)

[only mostly trust this the the hot](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m12s)

[reload sort of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m15s)

[works okay so you'll note this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m18s)

[close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m23s)

[whoop whoop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m26s)

[so now we've got this nice disjoint](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m29s)

[between uh where where it finds it and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m32s)

[where it goes I'm actually a little](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m35s)

[surprised that this was able to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m37s)

[work I'm a little I sort of expected it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m42s)

[not to be in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m46s)

[the put a button down](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m48s)

[here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m51s)

[button uh grid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m52s)

[Row one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h21m55s)

[test a little surprised when it went to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m06s)

[execute that it was able to find the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m08s)

[living outside](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m12s)

[of oh grid Road](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m16s)

[two there that's Clos to the behavior I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m20s)

[was expecting I'm not entirely clear how](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m23s)

[that menu item's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m25s)

[working](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m26s)

[this is the behavior I was expecting is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m30s)

[completely](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m32s)

[disabled obviously that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m36s)

[working I'm going have to go look into](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m42s)

[how it's actually finding the the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m44s)

[dialog Host this is the behavior I was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m46s)

[expecting down here where the button is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m48s)

[completely disabled because it is unable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m50s)

[to find a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m53s)

[Handler the the idea here with routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m54s)

[commands is you can specify a command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h22m57s)

[Target because when it walks up the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m00s)

[tree it's not going to find the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m03s)

[host it's next to it it's alongside](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m05s)

[rather than inside of it if you're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m07s)

[inside of it you don't need to care](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m09s)

[it'll find it in the tree and you're Off](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m11s)

[to the Races when you're not inside of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m13s)

[it that won't work so if we give this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m15s)

[guy a name real](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m17s)

[quick uh I don't know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m19s)

[drawer uh let's just make it obvious and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m22s)

[you name it like the type name people](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m26s)

[get infused so command Target here this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m27s)

[guy here is just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m30s)

[a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m32s)

[uh uh uh an input element and so we can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m34s)

[do something like binding element name](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m38s)

[something like that and now you'll know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m42s)

[when we open this guy this button closes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m45s)

[it make it test](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m49s)

[close I'm very surprised the menu is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m51s)

[able to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m53s)

[work I'll have to go look at how that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m54s)

[how that is actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m57s)

[working this is why you should test your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h23m59s)

[samples ahead of time rather than just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m01s)

[assuming you know how they](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m03s)

[work yeah and you'll also note that this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m07s)

[button it's hard to tell this button is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m10s)

[disabled when the uh drawer is closed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m12s)

[it's hard to tell because it's hidden](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m15s)

[but you can kind of C if you pay real](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m18s)

[close attention as soon as you hit close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m20s)

[the button does disable as the animation](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m22s)

[is is going there um because it now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m24s)

[knows hey that drawer isn't open so it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m28s)

[doesn't make sense to have it closed so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m30s)

[it defaults the the can execute to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m32s)

[false so for example if we go back up to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m34s)

[where we registered](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m37s)

[Command right uh this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h24m47s)

[why you can trigger from a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m04s)

[menu we we may end up going down that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m07s)

[because that's going to bother me but I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m10s)

[want to get through a few of the other](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m12s)

[things on this drawer host first before](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m13s)

[I get too](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m15s)

[ever get](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m19s)

[sidetracked okay other cool things about](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m22s)

[the drawer host so obviously this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m25s)

[behaving as though it is a flyy out you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m29s)

[don't have to have it behave as a flyy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m31s)

[out there are actually a couple](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m34s)

[slightly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h25m43s)

[out over the top whereas in standard](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m30s)

[mode this guy is now going to actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m32s)

[shove the content over uh to the side](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m34s)

[and I think we can see it does it show](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m37s)

[it in here or is it hidden away from us](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m40s)

[can't remember how this demo is actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m42s)

[set up left drawer top drawer blah blah](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m45s)

[blah can't remember I I don't see it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m50s)

[shown directly in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m53s)

[here uh well we'll just go back to our](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m55s)

[demo app and play with it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h26m58s)

[there uh so if we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m00s)

[here believe it's just called open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m03s)

[mode uh we've got default standard and I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m06s)

[I wonder why we don't show modal](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m09s)

[in close open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m11s)

[left I wonder why that that one doesn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m17s)

[uh go through oh I bet you it's because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m21s)

[these things are mapped to the same](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m23s)

[value I bet you that's the kicker we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m25s)

[and take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m29s)

[it we look at open mode yeah modal and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m31s)

[default are the exact same](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m35s)

[value that's why it doesn't show it but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m38s)

[if we want to go here and go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m40s)

[standard we can then see when we open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m42s)

[left that our stuff gets shoved to the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m44s)

[side if you are going to run in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m46s)

[standard way um and this was a judgment](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m48s)

[call uh because when you aren't running](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m52s)

[as standard and you're running as uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m55s)

[default or](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h27m58s)

[modal uh wrong](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m00s)

[one the it's very obvious where the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m02s)

[disjoint or where the separation is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m05s)

[between your drawer and your main](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m08s)

[content whereas when you're running](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m11s)

[with um when you're running without](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m13s)

[that uh and you are just doing open mode](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m17s)

[standard things easily get lost here uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m20s)

[especially if you're just using the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m24s)

[default coloring because there is no](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m25s)

[separation now there's there's multiple](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m28s)

[ways you could go about doing this you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m29s)

[could go through and set up like a a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m31s)

[border and and do a line separator my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m33s)

[personal preference is actually more](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m35s)

[akin to how the demo app does it because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m37s)

[you'll note here this guy is actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m40s)

[leveraging a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m42s)

[um uh a drawer host but it's slightly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m45s)

[different I don't know if it's obvious](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m49s)

[because of the the dark on dark let me](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m51s)

[switch it to light mode real quick and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m53s)

[that's probably be probably be a little](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m55s)

[easier to see so you can kind of see the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m57s)

[the the shadow that's being put on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h28m59s)

[versus if I come over here and change my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m02s)

[other app to light](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m04s)

[mode uh let's see base theme](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m07s)

[light uh let's see and then if we come](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m14s)

[over here and change you to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m18s)

[default there's kind of the the extra](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m24s)

[little gradient that along here and it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m26s)

[it's not trivial to see uh I don't have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m29s)

[my stuff](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m34s)

[running I really need to have a script](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m35s)

[that does this for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m38s)

[me there we go so if it's not obvious](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m40s)

[there's this little extra bit of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m44s)

[shadowing that comes through here from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m46s)

[elevation um to be able to show that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m48s)

[there's that um difference inside of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m50s)

[there so if you are running a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m53s)

[standard um depending on what kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h29m57s)

[look you're going for um whether you're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m00s)

[really just kind of looking for this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m03s)

[separation it's probably a reasonable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m05s)

[idea to consider going through and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m07s)

[making it uh a particular uh have some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m09s)

[level of Separation so uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m14s)

[what is the is it Shadow](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m19s)

[assist uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m22s)

[see uh uh where is the hang on I I got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m26s)

[to look I don't remember where this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m30s)

[sucker is there's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m31s)

[a oh oh the easy way uh just wrap this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m36s)

[sucker in a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m39s)

[card because the [ __ ] card will do it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m41s)

[for me down here come down](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m44s)

[here then if we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m48s)

[do well let's let's just look at that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m50s)

[real quick first so you can see there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m52s)

[we're getting a little bit of a an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m54s)

[elevation change just by wrapping it in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m56s)

[a card there's now a a separator there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h30m58s)

[um but we can actually go through and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m01s)

[make this bigger go Shadow assist](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m03s)

[uh where am](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m09s)

[I elevation assist elevation there we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m12s)

[uh let's bump this up to like a I don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m16s)

[know an eight something something big](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m19s)

[enough to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m22s)

[seen so now we got a we've got a much](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m23s)

[bigger set of elevation here you can see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m26s)

[the the elevation inside of the material](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m29s)

[designed in ZL library is just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m31s)

[implemented with a drop shadow and so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m33s)

[when you set that elevation assist to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m36s)

[one of the DP values effectively think](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m37s)

[of it as your drop shadow radius just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m40s)

[increasing uh in material design they'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m42s)

[talk about uh layers and elevation and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m44s)

[so the um the drop shadow gives you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m47s)

[those those bits of elevation I would](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m51s)

[have to go back and read the spec I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m53s)

[don't remember what the the guidelines](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m56s)

[are here as far as what's acceptable but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h31m57s)

[me personally I might do a card and I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m01s)

[might just turn the corner radius off](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m03s)

[because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m05s)

[Corner radius zero because I kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m07s)

[like the uh the square look](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m10s)

[here right something something more akin](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m13s)

[to that just to be able to separate it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m15s)

[out again to each his own decide what](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m18s)

[makes sense uh for your app but being](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m21s)

[able to have some some semblance uh even](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m25s)

[when you do this and you know what](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m29s)

[let's maybe I should maybe I should](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m35s)

[separate some of these guys apart so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m37s)

[let's go uh let's do a right drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m39s)

[two](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m44s)

[um open right and then we can do that we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m48s)

[can do this and then we're just going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m53s)

[to do something something akin to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h32m56s)

[this right um it is worth noting there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m00s)

[is no way to mix and match the open mode](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m03s)

[on a per](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m05s)

[drawer basis everything is either going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m07s)

[to be in the the standard or the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m09s)

[non uh let's see Clos](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m13s)

[drawer right uh hello on right something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m17s)

[more akin to this something more akin to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m22s)

[this uh open right and then this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m25s)

[here we're just GNA](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m29s)

[do we're gonna we're gonna just show off](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m32s)

[both side by side I think this goes well](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m35s)

[uh let's see command parameter and then](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m38s)

[we're just going to grab the dock](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m40s)

[right is we're going to have the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m43s)

[right dock be our be our example](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m45s)

[of oh doesn't want to doesn't want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m49s)

[play nice with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m52s)

[me suppose I did just change a bunch](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m54s)

[bunch of stuff on it okay nope nope nope](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h33m56s)

[nope nope nope open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m00s)

[right am I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m05s)

[stupid uh let's see oh you need this to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m09s)

[be the open command not the close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m13s)

[command that will make a difference if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m16s)

[you don't do the open command it will](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m18s)

[not open and then something like that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m20s)

[there we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m24s)

[go so we can push it from the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m25s)

[side right and this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m30s)

[now is closing all drawers uh about](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m32s)

[close all something like that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m37s)

[there okay um the let's see open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m45s)

[mode that one there uh there was one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m50s)

[other thing that was kind of briefly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m54s)

[shown here um from this bottom the idea](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m56s)

[that there is this kind of concept of a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h34m59s)

[corner radius so so if we come back up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m03s)

[to our drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m05s)

[host do uh right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m07s)

[drawer uh let's see uh right to our](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m11s)

[Corner radius we can do something like a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m13s)

[20 just to give it a nice rounded Edge](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m16s)

[and you know when we open it it's really](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m19s)

[hard to see a corner radius if it's not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m21s)

[bloody there or if it's not obvious](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m23s)

[where it is so in this case let's just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m25s)

[do uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m27s)

[background uh fuchsia because that is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m29s)

[always the color of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m31s)

[success uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m34s)

[okay restart that sucker because I don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m36s)

[trust the hot reload to pick up all of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m39s)

[these custom control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m41s)

[changes uh okay I'm an idiot what did I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m47s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m51s)

[wrong uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m52s)

[see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h35m55s)

[Corner radius that looks](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h36m00s)

[obvious left drawer Corner](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h36m47s)

[radius left or content I mean it clearly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h36m50s)

[works it works right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h36m53s)

[there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h36m55s)

[okay well we're g](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m00s)

[to one we're g to we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m03s)

[going to just debug this guy real quick](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m05s)

[because now I now I'm really](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m07s)

[binoculars on top of anywhere in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m20s)

[window that you want to Snoop or debug](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m22s)

[in this case](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m25s)

[and then the magical incantation is put](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m27s)

[your cursor over what you're interested](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m28s)

[zeros Us in right on what we were](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m32s)

[looking at so what I kind of expect here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m35s)

[is uh this guy has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m39s)

[a oh the The adorner Decorator clearly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m46s)

[has the corner radius](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m50s)

[applied uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m55s)

[and if we do here that clearly has the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h37m57s)

[corner](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m11s)

[then](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m13s)

[huh I'm missing something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m22s)

[obvious because it's clearly right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m25s)

[there and when I hover on it I can see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m29s)

[down at the bottom there that this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m32s)

[here clearly has a corner radius because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m35s)

[when you hover on an item in Snoop you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m38s)

[do get this nice preview look of what](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m40s)

[the element is which is very convenient](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m42s)

[to be able to find](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m45s)

[it uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m47s)

[why why you don't work the way I expect](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m50s)

[okay okay now now I have to look because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m53s)

[because clearly the other one works](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h38m59s)

[exactly as designed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m01s)

[and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m08s)

[just no I shouldn't need to check](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m11s)

[the yeah I shouldn't need to check](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m20s)

[that uh this guy is literally just the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m24s)

[same oh it's because ah my content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m28s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m46s)

[know why would](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m49s)

[you okay let's go look at the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m51s)

[theme](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m55s)

[sorry detour detour while we debug why](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m57s)

[it's not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h39m59s)

[working](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m00s)

[uh CU secretly this is also a test for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m04s)

[the 5](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m07s)

[release CU there's very plausibly things](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m08s)

[that are broken however the demo app is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m11s)

[running latest and greatest as well uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m13s)

[is it in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m16s)

[generic where is the dorost](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m18s)

[style color Zone dra a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m24s)

[host okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m28s)

[so there's that there's the visual State](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m31s)

[groups and we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m35s)

[have content cover left drawer right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m38s)

[drawer and we have right to Z](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m43s)

[index there's what you kind of would](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m49s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m55s)

[doorer decorator Shadow](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h40m57s)

[effect want to relaunch because I I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m08s)

[convinced that that adorner is doing its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m10s)

[job and I'm just too stupid to see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m12s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m25s)

[okay clearly it works on on the bottom](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m26s)

[one and now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m29s)

[I'm mildly concerned as to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m32s)

[how I want to look at the bottom drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m36s)

[and see if there's anything different in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m39s)

[here set up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m42s)

[accordingly adorner decorator bottom](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m45s)

[corner](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m48s)

[radius](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h41m55s)

[okay what am I what am I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m07s)

[missing I'm clearly missing something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m09s)

[because this clearly has it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m11s)

[working I'm sorry I just got to take a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m18s)

[look at this okay so there's Snoop we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m20s)

[are targeting the bottom border this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m22s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m25s)

[clearly has it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m27s)

[set oh because this guy is down](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m31s)

[oh that's how okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m41s)

[okay well this is a good lesson this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m46s)

[a good lesson okay so I'm an idiot uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m48s)

[and I will demonstrate what I did wrong](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m52s)

[so I slapped a stack panel in here and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m55s)

[went through and basically drew a box](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h42m58s)

[with a background of fuchsia margin of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m01s)

[16 put some elements in it the the issue](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m03s)

[that's running in is this type of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m07s)

[background doesn't let you see the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m10s)

[corner radius now if we were to go up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m13s)

[here uh uh right draw background and do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m17s)

[fuchsia huzza](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m24s)

[huzza so the the difference being if you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m28s)

[set the background of your content your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m31s)

[content rides of functionally on top of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m33s)

[the drawer and it can cover up the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m37s)

[corners and in my case even though I set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m40s)

[a margin on the stack panel to inset it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m43s)

[so it wasn't covering up the corners it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m45s)

[was still setting the fuchsia color](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m47s)

[background on the content and the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m49s)

[content doesn't get the corner radius](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m51s)

[applied to it right the the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m53s)

[background color and the corner radius](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m56s)

[get applied to the the door itself not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h43m57s)

[the content on top of it so when in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m00s)

[doubt don't be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m02s)

[dumb and then you can do something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m03s)

[that though I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m05s)

[change this so let's see uh I think it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m06s)

[what is it Z](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m11s)

[0 0 20 I think are the the two corners](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m13s)

[for the right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m18s)

[side yeah so these guys can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m20s)

[be these guys can be can be rounded on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m24s)

[there okay if we go back to uh uh open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m29s)

[mode uh default where we have the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m34s)

[overlay here this overlay color is a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m38s)

[default one that is applied however the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m41s)

[the demo app as we were just briefly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m44s)

[looking at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m47s)

[it does show](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m49s)

[a uh a way of uh changing it so there is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m52s)

[an overlay background and we can come up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h44m58s)

[here and we can do something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m00s)

[overlay background gets I don't know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m02s)

[blue right and this this immediately](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m06s)

[goes in and you can you can start to to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m09s)

[theme it out if you if you really prefer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m12s)

[to have a a blue rather than a than a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m14s)

[black so be it um I don't think there is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m17s)

[any way to change](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m21s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m24s)

[I think the opacity is just fixed but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m26s)

[let me let me confirm that real quick we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m29s)

[already got it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m31s)

[open uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m33s)

[see yeah I believe the target opacity is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m39s)

[fixed because it has to animate it with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m42s)

[the visual state so it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m46s)

[is going to animate yeah so it's going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m49s)

[to animate to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m52s)

[056 of so basically half opacity of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m53s)

[whatever color you set is going to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m57s)

[the on and at present there is no no](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h45m59s)

[configuration for it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m03s)

[yourself okay what else did I miss on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m07s)

[the drawer host let's see we've got the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m09s)

[the open all the close all the close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m12s)

[this we've got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m15s)

[the corner radius the color background](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m18s)

[overlay color let's do default](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m22s)

[this de this just demonstrates putting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m26s)

[it a uh a purple in or whatever else you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m28s)

[want yeah something like that okay okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m33s)

[Victor I think you're going to win and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m37s)

[we're going to go chase down why the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m39s)

[heck this menu item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m40s)

[works because that bothers me that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m43s)

[bothers me that the menu item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m46s)

[Works um because clearly without the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m49s)

[command Target the button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m52s)

[fails right so without the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m54s)

[Target the button is disabled but yet](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h46m56s)

[from or are these coming from Snoop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h47m50s)

[itself these might be coming from Snoop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h47m53s)

[itself because once it's inside of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=00h47m54s)

[interesting I'm about to learn something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m15s)

[new I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m17s)

[think uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m18s)

[see can we look at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m21s)

[Target yeah of course you've been](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m28s)

[optimized](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m30s)

[away that would be too convenient if you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m32s)

[weren't user](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m41s)

[you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m53s)

[not perfectly lining](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h04m57s)

[up sender](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m07s)

[is how is the sender doing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m13s)

[that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m17s)

[uh okay I had kind of assumed that it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m20s)

[wasn't coming from here but now I'm not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m23s)

[so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m25s)

[sure this guy just added up a command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m30s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m44s)

[interesting parent scope so I'm still a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m49s)

[little confused as to how we got got all](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m52s)

[the way into](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m54s)

[there cuz this is menu item invoke click](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h05m56s)

[after render so this is the thing that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m01s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m04s)

[clicked routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m08s)

[command so it was not executed UI](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m17s)

[element UI element would come from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m21s)

[Target but Target came from see execute](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m27s)

[implementation I don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m37s)

[see jump from right there to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m42s)

[there um how did we get there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m50s)

[I'm betting something was optimized](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h06m54s)

[out command is routed command so it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m00s)

[would have matched it there command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m04s)

[Source would have been the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m07s)

[Target so I guess the other thing to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m09s)

[look at is does this thing have a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m11s)

[command Target that's being set on it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m14s)

[just take a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h07m17s)

[left that doesn't make any](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m09s)

[sense why would that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m14s)

[button be causing this to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m21s)

[trigger okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m27s)

[so I want to see the difference](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m31s)

[here so this guy actually doesn't need](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m40s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m51s)

[and we should still work because this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m56s)

[will trigger the the top](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h18m58s)

[one we'll trigger the opening of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m03s)

[drawer on the bottom one because of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m05s)

[data binding and now when we do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m07s)

[close what the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m14s)

[heck](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m21s)

[now close doesn't trigger](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m26s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m32s)

[huh I'm very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m38s)

[confirm what I what I think I just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m46s)

[saw if I put this button back](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m49s)

[I put this button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h19m58s)

[back and I open you let's disable you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h20m02s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h20m06s)

[moment and then I go file](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h20m10s)

[close no longer working](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h20m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h20m26s)

[hurting uh better than never what's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m01s)

[today's topic hey Andrew uh we were uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m03s)

[playing around with the the drawer host](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m07s)

[in material design uh going through it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m09s)

[and then I ran into a very interesting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m12s)

[problem okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m14s)

[okay I think I understand this so I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m18s)

[going to talk through what I think the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m20s)

[problem is and what the solution is and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m22s)

[if anyone spots it before me uh you win](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m25s)

[okay so let's back up let's back up we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m28s)

[have two drawer host instances created](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m33s)

[okay we're going to just we're going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m37s)

[ignore the right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m39s)

[drawer inside of each of the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m40s)

[instances are buttons and the buttons in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m43s)

[question that matter are this open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m47s)

[left and this open left to now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m51s)

[specifically what is important here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m56s)

[the fact that the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h21m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m02s)

[uh no what's important is that these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m05s)

[buttons are inside of the drawer hose](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m07s)

[okay so these go through and open right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m10s)

[and what we saw down here with this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m16s)

[button and I'm just going to I'm going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m18s)

[to just give me one more row definition](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m20s)

[right we're going to we're going to put](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m23s)

[this up cuz what we showed with this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m24s)

[button down here is that this will not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m27s)

[work this routed command will not work](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m30s)

[to close the drawer host because the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m32s)

[routed command needs to know its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m35s)

[command's Target it doesn't know where](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m37s)

[the command Target](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m39s)

[is and so when we launch this guy uh I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m41s)

[think I finally made sense of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m46s)

[this uh somebody's in the wrong row](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m49s)

[right three right okay so this guy can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m52s)

[open and close right that works this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h22m56s)

[close button is never working because it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m00s)

[doesn't know where it is this one oh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m02s)

[which we removed the data binding for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m06s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m08s)

[not yeah so hang on it's not the data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m11s)

[binding it's not the data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m14s)

[binding so uh left R](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m18s)

[open drawer host left drawer content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m21s)

[these are both just you so the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m25s)

[bottom the bottom drawer host down here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m26s)

[this one is just using routed commands](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m29s)

[to open and close this one is using data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m31s)

[binding on this is left open property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m35s)

[which is a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m39s)

[simplistic uh observable property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m41s)

[nothing fancy right we've got a command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m44s)

[that sets the value to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m47s)

[true in our](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m49s)

[zaml we have uh the inside the left](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m51s)

[drawer we have a routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m55s)

[command that will set it back to false](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h23m56s)

[and this routed command works because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m00s)

[when it's executed it walks up the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m02s)

[hierarchy looking for uh looking for a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m05s)

[command Target that will handle the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m08s)

[command which in this case we saw that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m10s)

[the draw host Constructor registers up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m12s)

[for these routed commands it has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m15s)

[handlers right and it's Constructor](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m18s)

[right okay okay that's how these buttons](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m21s)

[work right open close open close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m24s)

[everyone's happy the confusion comes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m28s)

[when you go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m31s)

[open file](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m32s)

[close and I'm going what the heck](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m35s)

[because this menu item here is just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m39s)

[using the routed command without a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m42s)

[command Target this exact same setup is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m45s)

[exactly what this button down here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m50s)

[doing doing and it never](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m52s)

[enables never can find it right it has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h24m55s)

[no idea where this sucker is now I think](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m00s)

[I think if we open this up we'll see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m04s)

[something interesting so I think what we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m07s)

[can also do is open file close and it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m10s)

[works open file close and it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m15s)

[works does anyone see it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m19s)

[that's the part this is the part that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m23s)

[was confusing me is I wasn't tracking](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m24s)

[where it is open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m26s)

[left it's following](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m30s)

[Focus see this down here Snoop is Snoop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m35s)

[is got so many useful features so many](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m38s)

[useful features right so when this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m40s)

[fires it's following keyboard Focus to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m43s)

[know where the heck to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m45s)

[go and so that's what so if we do open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m48s)

[left keyboard focus is a button if we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m51s)

[click we can see that the button in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m54s)

[question is the open left it's kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m57s)

[hard to that blue border but it's got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h25m59s)

[the little snoop red border around](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m02s)

[it so when this command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m05s)

[fires it's that's the reason the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m08s)

[open left was showing as the source of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m11s)

[the command it was following the focused](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m13s)

[element to know where to apply it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m15s)

[to ow world makes sense](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m18s)

[again world makes sense again menu items](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m22s)

[are magical apparently and will use the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m27s)

[focused item as their target interesting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m30s)

[I am sure there is probably something in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m35s)

[here uh that calls that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m41s)

[out and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m51s)

[uh I am I am willing to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h26m56s)

[bet yeah so there's the following](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m03s)

[example shows how to set up a menu item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m06s)

[so that when it is clicked it will](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m08s)

[invoke the paste command on a text box](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m09s)

[assuming the text box has keyboard](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m13s)

[Focus so this menu item here is very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m18s)

[intentionally executing this on the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m22s)

[keyboard focused](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m24s)

[element uh let's see the WPF uh is the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m27s)

[routed command and is the focus of this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m30s)

[overview that's not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m34s)

[it there's the line there the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m36s)

[Target is the object on which uh to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m39s)

[execute the command the command Target](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m42s)

[Pro is only applicable when it is a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m44s)

[routed command great if the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m46s)

[Target is set on a command source and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m48s)

[the corresponding is not a routed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m50s)

[command it is ignored great if the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m51s)

[command Target is not set the element](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m54s)

[with keyboard Focus will be the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m56s)

[Target there is the line of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h27m58s)

[documentation I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m00s)

[needed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m04s)

[so everything I said earlier was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m06s)

[accurate uh with one minor addition that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m09s)

[we're going to slap on here if you don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m12s)

[set the command Target the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m14s)

[Target will be the thing with keyboard](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m16s)

[focus and if you are struggling to find](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m20s)

[your keyboard Focus element install](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m22s)

[Snoop and it will tell you and your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m24s)

[world will be happier and everything](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m26s)

[will be wonderful worth noting um you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m28s)

[the the keyboard Focus element down here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m32s)

[you'll see it's Button as soon as I uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m33s)

[move around you will you will find that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m36s)

[the the focus element ends up changing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m39s)

[at different points so just be aware but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m41s)

[this is an awesome item to be able to go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m44s)

[through and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m48s)

[do so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m49s)

[okay so in general you probably want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m54s)

[set your command Target unless of course](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h28m57s)

[you are implementing something like that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m00s)

[paste menu where it's like hey I want an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m02s)

[an edit menu with a paste that closes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m05s)

[everything down okay so the only reason](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m07s)

[that was working is because Focus was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m10s)

[remaining on this button now one could](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m14s)

[argue that's possibly a bug and focus](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m16s)

[should probably move off of the button](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m18s)

[into something in here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m20s)

[maybe I don't know if that's the best](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m23s)

[place for the material design library to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m25s)

[automatically do it or if it's better to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m28s)

[let the app developer do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m30s)

[it 61 half a dozen the other but uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m32s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m37s)

[okay was there anything else on the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m42s)

[drawer host that was worth going into I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m44s)

[think that mostly covers it so high](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m47s)

[level overview use it when you want the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m50s)

[flyy outs coming in from one of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h29m52s)

[it'll make your life easy um if you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m03s)

[don't care about controlling it from The](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m06s)

[View model at all and you just want it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m07s)

[UI controlled the routed commands are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m09s)

[great I highly recommend setting the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m12s)

[command Target hang on I just want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m14s)

[prove something to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m15s)

[myself if I explicitly null this sucker](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m17s)

[out](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m20s)

[I bet you it never fires](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m24s)

[now I bet you so open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m28s)

[left no null must be the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m33s)

[default uh I'd have to go and pull it up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m38s)

[elsewhere because I want to see the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m41s)

[default of the dependency property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m42s)

[interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m44s)

[interesting anyway um and then key](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m47s)

[features to be aware of are the the open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m50s)

[mode of default when you want the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m52s)

[overlay or the um the modal uh no sorry](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m53s)

[the standard option if you want it to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h30m58s)

[slide your content to the side versus](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m01s)

[overlaying it on top very useful if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m03s)

[you're building say like a Gmail clone](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m05s)

[or something where they've kind of got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m07s)

[the the push out to the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m09s)

[side](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m11s)

[um Corner radius and background color uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m14s)

[that's just for pities use as you see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m18s)

[fit um I personally would uh say the use](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m20s)

[of the material design card I think is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m26s)

[potentially one of the most underrated](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m28s)

[controls in the entire Library the fact](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m30s)

[that it gives you the ability to get](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m32s)

[nice elevation stuff um kind of out the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m34s)

[gate for free is it adds a nice pop so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m37s)

[if there's now obviously anything can be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m43s)

[overdone but if you've got something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m46s)

[where adding elevation adds Clarity the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m48s)

[card is a really powerful control for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m51s)

[doing that um and does make things just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m53s)

[look a little bit nicer there's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m57s)

[something nice about it um be aware that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h31m59s)

[the card does need um a little bit of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m01s)

[space around it the card has this drop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m04s)

[shadow on all four sides but because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m07s)

[only one of the sides has any extra](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m10s)

[space it's getting cut off so you never](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m12s)

[actually see the the Shadow on any of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m15s)

[the sides now we could put a margin on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m18s)

[the card to give it that EXT ra space](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m19s)

[but then it's going to look awkward cuz](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m22s)

[it's not going to be top of line type](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m24s)

[situation so be aware of that that it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m25s)

[worth uh keeping things in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m29s)

[place](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m32s)

[uh yeah I think there's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m35s)

[that there's the drawer host everything](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m37s)

[is simple and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m41s)

[working cool okay I think that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m44s)

[everything on drawer host I want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m46s)

[cover uh now something completely](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m48s)

[unrelated and and completely different](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m50s)

[um I discovered a bug in my tree View](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m53s)

[and I'd like to go fix it because it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m56s)

[bothered me and I wanted it to die so I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h32m58s)

[have started implementing it on another](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m03s)

[project which is great because it has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m06s)

[been a perfect opportunity for me to put](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m09s)

[it through its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m11s)

[Paces um but I discovered that there is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m12s)

[a flaw in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m15s)

[it uh when when the bound collect ction](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m17s)

[is a collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m22s)

[view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m26s)

[so uh we're going to go and just fix](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m28s)

[that so we've got all of these UI tests](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m32s)

[in here which are great guess we don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m36s)

[need that using we can get rid of it um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m38s)

[let's go ahead and do a new user control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m41s)

[because this is so for the UI tests in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m44s)

[the material design](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m47s)

[Library um the zaml test is really great](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m48s)

[if you just want to throw raw zaml at it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m52s)

[the moment you want to do like code](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m54s)

[Behind These stuff the easiest thing to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m55s)

[do is just build a user control and use](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m57s)

[that tree list view uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h33m59s)

[with uh how about collection view we'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m04s)

[do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m07s)

[that okay PSE sudo build me a treeist](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m09s)

[view and then I'm just gonna I'm G to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m12s)

[more or less copy the whole](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m15s)

[thing uh and then we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m17s)

[uh tree list](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m20s)

[view uh with collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m23s)

[view so little known trick so this x](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m29s)

[class determines the the class for the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m32s)

[code behind of your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m34s)

[zaml uh you can actually leverage this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m37s)

[in uh resource dictionary so if you ever](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m40s)

[run into a situation where you're like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m43s)

[man I really like this resource](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m45s)

[dictionary but I don't want to have to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m47s)

[uh you know move it somewhere else](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m50s)

[because it doesn't have a code behind](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m52s)

[you can give your resource dictionaries](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m54s)

[code behind files they don't come by](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m56s)

[default but you can beat them into](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h34m59s)

[submission and make them have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m01s)

[one uh use that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m03s)

[knowledge at your own risk okay uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m06s)

[see tree list view with collection and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m10s)

[then I probably want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m12s)

[grab I want to do something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m15s)

[this but I also want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m19s)

[is that what was in this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m24s)

[one no what's what what are in these I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m29s)

[probably want to do something a little](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m33s)

[bit more akin](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m35s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m37s)

[this actually it I don't really care](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m43s)

[about most of this let's go here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m50s)

[and then we're going to just flatten you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m53s)

[up and clean you up and paste okay and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h35m56s)

[then we're going to go copy paste get](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m01s)

[rid of this okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m05s)

[so got this we've got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m07s)

[this uh let's see so this will build](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m11s)

[that out that'll build that out uh let's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m15s)

[go write the test so we can play with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m18s)

[this and make sure it's working before](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m20s)

[we get two carried](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m22s)

[away Tre this VI test and let's just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m25s)

[collapse this guy down nope nope not the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m29s)

[button I told you to do thank you thank](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m31s)

[you okay so let's go with test uh public](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m34s)

[async task uh tree list view with uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m39s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m45s)

[view uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m46s)

[renders](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m48s)

[items b](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m50s)

[boom and then we can get pretty close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m52s)

[with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m55s)

[this because this should basically just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h36m57s)

[work out of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m00s)

[gate and then we want to come up here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m02s)

[and I would like to attach to remote](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m05s)

[process false](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m07s)

[great uh if I do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m10s)

[this and I debug this test it should](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m13s)

[open up and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m17s)

[work crossing fingers Hing it opens up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m19s)

[on this screen and not on a different](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m22s)

[screen cuz that's going to be very uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m23s)

[unimpressive if it opens up on my other](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m25s)

[monitor come](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m28s)

[on goo compiler](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m31s)

[logic there we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m35s)

[okay I think one of my colleagues was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m44s)

[complaining about this earlier there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m46s)

[seems to be an issue on the latest](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m47s)

[preview Visual Studio where when you hit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m49s)

[a breakpoint you'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m51s)

[note it's taking a little](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m53s)

[while yeah that was very long to stop at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h37m57s)

[a break](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m00s)

[point very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m01s)

[long all Allelujah we stopped at the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m04s)

[break point though okay so we can come](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m06s)

[over here we can play around with this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m08s)

[okay so this gets us this gets us pretty](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m10s)

[close](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m14s)

[um Visual Studio what are you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m20s)

[doing Visual Studio may be crashing it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m25s)

[not hip to whatever the heck I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m28s)

[doing come on just stop executing the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m31s)

[test this was not meant to be a hard](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m35s)

[test for you Visual Studio okay so test](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m37s)

[starts up test launches test works](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m42s)

[now um I want to make](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m45s)

[sure I don't like the this template](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m49s)

[selector so we're going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m51s)

[grab uh something more akin to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h38m55s)

[this and we're going to put that in its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m00s)

[place uh let's see because I don't want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m04s)

[any of this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m06s)

[tree list view items binding displays](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m17s)

[the value everyone 's happy great uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m20s)

[we'll check the test out really quick uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m23s)

[assert content we're just going to do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m26s)

[we're going to get rid of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m29s)

[colors uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m32s)

[because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m39s)

[nope we go okay so that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m44s)

[should if I run this test blindly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m49s)

[without doing anything this test should](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m51s)

[go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m53s)

[green okay um I'm a little concerned](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h39m58s)

[that it's not launching the right one so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m06s)

[this is tree list view with collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m09s)

[view okay let's try this again because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m14s)

[I'd like we're going to do rather than](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m17s)

[just going red green on this test we're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m19s)

[going to go green red green that's the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m20s)

[goal okay so there's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m23s)

[green perfect now we would like to break](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m25s)

[this so rather than what is being set up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m29s)

[here I would like to make you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m32s)

[private I would like to do a public uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m36s)

[Eye collection View and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m40s)

[name it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m43s)

[items](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m45s)

[uh yeah that's going to work just fine](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m47s)

[thank you uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m50s)

[uh items Source I just need you to have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m52s)

[a different](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m55s)

[name and then we'll do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h40m56s)

[this and then down here he's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m00s)

[unhappy and what we should be able to do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m05s)

[is collection uh view Source get default](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m07s)

[view of item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m12s)

[source and then we should be able to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m16s)

[take this guy here and plug it into](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m18s)

[items like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m20s)

[that okay now my suspicion based on the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m22s)

[behavior I saw was this now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m27s)

[fails and it may be yeah](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m31s)

[good okay so green red now we go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m36s)

[green so now the question is why do it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m41s)

[fail um because all we did was change it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m45s)

[off an of an observ able](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m49s)

[collection um I do want to just confirm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m51s)

[I I'm fairly confident I know the answer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m54s)

[to this but if I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h41m56s)

[do um public list tree](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m00s)

[item uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m06s)

[items right and I write like this and I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m09s)

[do this and I think if I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m14s)

[do down here and go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m17s)

[items gets uh items source to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m21s)

[list I think this actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m26s)

[works but I want to confirm I realized](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m30s)

[that my tests were written only with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m32s)

[observable collections which is probably](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m34s)

[what you want to use oh list doesn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m37s)

[even work](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m39s)

[oh so clearly I've hardcoded something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m42s)

[to observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m45s)

[collection um so it's not just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m47s)

[collection view that does doesn't work](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m49s)

[it's straight up list that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m51s)

[either great I was worried I made this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m53s)

[thing too](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m56s)

[bulletproof okay so let's go down that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h42m58s)

[immediately making me suspect of the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m01s)

[wrapper collection that we did for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m03s)

[this the fact that even list doesn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m06s)

[work because at first I was thinking](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m08s)

[that it was you know maybe I maybe I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m10s)

[only handled I list of T and not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m12s)

[non-generic ey](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m15s)

[list um but now I'm thinking that it is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m16s)

[yeah this coer value](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m21s)

[here because when the items get Bound in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m29s)

[this call back occurs and you'll note](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m33s)

[this internal item Source we call its](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m36s)

[Constructor passing in the new](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m39s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m49s)

[this is going of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m52s)

[T but this is always of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m54s)

[object so the t is kind of worthless](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h43m58s)

[here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m03s)

[H I am wondering if this guy should be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m07s)

[non-generic I need him to be generic](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m14s)

[though I need him to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m18s)

[generic well I don't need him to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m21s)

[generic this guy could be observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m24s)

[collection of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m26s)

[object and this class is technically](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m28s)

[public but I did put it in the internal](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m31s)

[name space and the only reason it's set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m33s)

[up that way is I have a strong suspicion](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m34s)

[if I make it internal people are going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m37s)

[to want to do custom things with this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m40s)

[tree list View and if that class is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m42s)

[internal they won't be able to do it so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m45s)

[I've made it public so people can do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m47s)

[stuff with it if they want I don't think](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m49s)

[you should because I reserve the right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m52s)

[to treat this like an internal class and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m54s)

[change it willy-nilly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m55s)

[but yeah so I'm curious what happens](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h44m59s)

[what happens right inside of this coer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h45m03s)

[through](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m26s)

[there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m28s)

[that that is shocking to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m30s)

[me](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m38s)

[continue I mean if a null comes through](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m41s)

[that explains why it doesn't render any](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m44s)

[items because it thinks it got a null so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m46s)

[so that kind of makes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m50s)

[sense question now is why is it getting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m52s)

[a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m55s)

[null is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h47m56s)

[it is it because of a type coercion](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m01s)

[problem and this is base](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m05s)

[object oh and I guess I actually even](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m11s)

[did this implementation wrong these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m13s)

[nullability on null and not null uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m25s)

[there's a third choice there's no](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m28s)

[nullable no not nullable and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m31s)

[unknown and the reason this isn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m34s)

[squawking at me because I got them wrong](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m36s)

[is because the entirety of the WPF uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m38s)

[libraries have no nullable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m42s)

[annotations it predates Noble](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m44s)

[annotations so none of them have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m46s)

[decorated so they're all unknown and so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m47s)

[you you can put down either one and it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m50s)

[goes eh sure I'll trust you it's not a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m52s)

[good it's not a good thing basically](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m56s)

[every object that comes out of WPF](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h48m58s)

[there's very few that can't be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m00s)

[knowable um okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m09s)

[so let's let's I'm realizing let me just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m13s)

[double check if that value is coming](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m16s)

[through as null let me just make sure](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m18s)

[that I didn't do something stupid in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m20s)

[like my my data binding and and like buy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m22s)

[oh this is the data template](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m26s)

[stupid uh we'll get rid of that because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m39s)

[that shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h49m42s)

[being evaluated](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m36s)

[once and then it never raises property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m37s)

[change the binding doesn't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m40s)

[re-evaluate and we get standard Behavior](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m42s)

[the fact that I've set my data context](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m45s)

[kind of self-referential to call back on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m47s)

[myself is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m50s)

[potentially aha look at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m52s)

[that okay so list Works list works you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m55s)

[just have to not be an idiot okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h50m59s)

[let's go back](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m02s)

[here okay so if if list](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m06s)

[works that's fine okay so that's that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m10s)

[less](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m13s)

[concerning right and so we'll come down](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m14s)

[here we'll do this does collection view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m17s)

[work](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m21s)

[now if I set it first now in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m23s)

[theory I think collection views are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m28s)

[supposed to notify collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m31s)

[changes yeah so in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m34s)

[theory if I do this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m40s)

[first I should be able to add these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m43s)

[afterwards but we're going to run the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m45s)

[test and see if I run here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m46s)

[I might have to go look at that failure](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m54s)

[that I saw and figure out what exactly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m56s)

[it was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h51m57s)

[doing one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m00s)

[failed did you even](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m02s)

[start failed to find child](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m06s)

[element uh line](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m10s)

[966 oh so it it just straight up failed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m16s)

[to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m18s)

[to find any](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m20s)

[elements so if we do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m22s)

[this just want to make sure that when](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m30s)

[that thing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m32s)

[launches okay so if we look at the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m42s)

[rendered](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m45s)

[how to do break points](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m49s)

[again it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m53s)

[empty okay so that is that's F okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m55s)

[it is it is still failing on collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h52m59s)

[view even when I set it early enough](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m02s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m04s)

[good so but I suspect now if I catch it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m07s)

[inside of that coer call back I will](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m11s)

[have a non-n no value dear Heavens](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m15s)

[Visual](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m16s)

[you care about break points something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m28s)

[something is up in preview](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m31s)

[six um okay so let's go here I want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m33s)

[catch this guy here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m37s)

[now come back here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m39s)

[debug okay so base](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m48s)

[value now we wait while it evaluates the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m51s)

[expression come on Visual Studio this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m55s)

[not a hard](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h53m58s)

[done has significantly hampered](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m02s)

[performance no item is not the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m06s)

[expression I want you to evaluate](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m09s)

[here okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m13s)

[cancel cancel](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m15s)

[cancel cancel cancel cancel thank](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m18s)

[you glad we all agree on that I would](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m22s)

[like you to unhang wow this is just bad](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m25s)

[Visual Studio you're making my life](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m28s)

[hard at least you're making me not want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m32s)

[to work with break points ever](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m34s)

[again because this is darn near](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m37s)

[unusable might have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m42s)

[to I might have to install non preview](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m45s)

[Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m48s)

[I normally running the visual studio](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m50s)

[previews are fairly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m52s)

[stable and it's always fun to play with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m53s)

[the new toys coming but by definition](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m55s)

[you're on a preview build so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h54m58s)

[occasionally crap like this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m01s)

[happens and it's the way it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m03s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m06s)

[however usually if it's this bad it gets](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m09s)

[fixed quickly so I'm going to go out on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m12s)

[a limb by next Tuesday preview seven](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m20s)

[um wow really you're going to now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m23s)

[evaluate expression](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m25s)

[element come on Visual Studio this is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m29s)

[this is kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m32s)

[ridiculous](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m34s)

[um I'm wondering if I need to start](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m36s)

[closing up some of these tool windows I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m39s)

[don't know if they're competing with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m40s)

[each other there we go okay list](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m41s)

[collection view there we have it thank](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m44s)

[you that's all I wanted to see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m47s)

[heesh okay and this is this is now more](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m51s)

[in line with what I kind of expect that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m54s)

[I'm running into is the underlying](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h55m57s)

[collection is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m01s)

[non-generic which means my cast here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m05s)

[going to be highly](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m09s)

[problematic because I look for things](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m13s)

[that are I inumerable of t](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m16s)

[okay so I think the solution here okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m20s)

[we're just going to stop stop executing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m23s)

[stop it stop it Visual Studio I I I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m25s)

[think I already know how to fix this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m27s)

[just shut down and stop doing whatever](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m29s)

[you think it is you need to be doing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m31s)

[turn off the debugger and let me drive](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m34s)

[again so I think the solution here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m36s)

[going to be this collection needs to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m37s)

[non-generic um so I think this guy here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m43s)

[becomes object ICT nullable this guy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m48s)

[drops the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m50s)

[T that guy goes like that cuz I don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m53s)

[think the t is used in most](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h56m56s)

[places yeah so it's all so that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m04s)

[there's an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m07s)

[override uh I assume that is basically](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m10s)

[the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m13s)

[same yeah and then we're going to get](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m16s)

[bit here again okay so I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m19s)

[think yeah so okay because we are only](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m23s)

[using this in exactly one place internal](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m27s)

[item source to be object nullable so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m30s)

[okay so we're going to do this we're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m34s)

[going to do this we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m35s)

[we're going to go here we're going to go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m38s)

[here we're going to go here we're going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m40s)

[to go object](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m43s)

[nullable and pull it through and then I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m46s)

[think we can probably just about swap](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m50s)

[out every single one of these guys for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m52s)

[object](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m55s)

[nullable uh this guy here is going to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m57s)

[confused for a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h57m59s)

[minute](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m01s)

[thanks uh I don't think I really even](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m06s)

[need the cast there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m08s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m11s)

[yeah uh I don't even need the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m14s)

[cast and then this guy goes we're going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m17s)

[to come back to you here in a second](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m21s)

[this guy here becomes object](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m23s)

[nullable and then this guy here does the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m26s)

[same thing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m29s)

[becomes Hey JC how you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m32s)

[doing object](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m36s)

[nullable oh well now that we got a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m39s)

[couple people on I I I will I want I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h58m42s)

[hi uh okay so this guy here is going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m23s)

[go to I inumerable this is then going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m27s)

[become innumerable empty of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m30s)

[object and then this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m34s)

[becomes object like this and I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m37s)

[think that there just fixes the whole](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m40s)

[bug this is the wonderful part about](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m44s)

[tests then the world becomes a happy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m48s)

[place and it blows up because there's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m51s)

[now a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m55s)

[compilers uh let's see what's going on](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=01h59m57s)

[here so we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m00s)

[have something here that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m02s)

[is expecting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m13s)

[there it's an internal thing so it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m15s)

[shouldn't really](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m18s)

[like I don't expect it to propagate out](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m19s)

[very far though there are going to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m22s)

[I'm realizing there are some unit tests](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m24s)

[specifically on that collection as well](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m26s)

[I'm probably going to need to go fix](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m29s)

[those](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m31s)

[yeah not not a shock](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m33s)

[in uh so this is going to need to change](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m37s)

[to uh let's see this guy goes like this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m41s)

[this guy goes like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m44s)

[this uh let's see we dro the T off of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m46s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m49s)

[guy uh is T even needed here nope and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m51s)

[then get all is expanded T isn't needed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m55s)

[here either and then we've got a whole](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h00m58s)

[metric ton of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m00s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m02s)

[so that goes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m05s)

[away nice part is if there's going to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m08s)

[any](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m10s)

[breaks man I will say this AI infused](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m14s)

[refactor](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m18s)

[like all I'm doing is tab tab tab](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m20s)

[tab like I used have to think about](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m25s)

[these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m27s)

[refractors](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m31s)

[like that that right there is what AI is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m33s)

[amazing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m37s)

[for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m39s)

[um okay so now let's let's try to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m40s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m43s)

[again there we go okay so step one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m45s)

[let's run these test we'll run the unit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m49s)

[tests on the collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m53s)

[itself wow those were remarkably fast I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h01m56s)

[don't believe](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m01s)

[you okay I believe you now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m02s)

[wow okay so there's some performance](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m05s)

[improvements in this area too dang it I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m07s)

[was really hoping my decision to install](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m10s)

[Visual Studio would be simpler one uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m12s)

[what plugin uh enabled that oh the AI](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m15s)

[infused one so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m17s)

[that is a good question I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m19s)

[think I think that's in Tel](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m22s)

[code um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m25s)

[which](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m32s)

[um I believe I hang on before I put my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m34s)

[put my foot in my mouth](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m38s)

[the yeah cuz people like an intell code](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m45s)

[and co-pilot to being](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m49s)

[um very similar they they they help you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m52s)

[accomplish similar tasks but they are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m57s)

[very different animals um and telecode](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h02m59s)

[is much more around like your your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m02s)

[inline um refactoring type situations](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m05s)

[whereas co-pilot is a little more on the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m09s)

[creative side of writing and building](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m10s)

[out stuff um yeah so this guy here now](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m13s)

[the one thing I was hoping to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m18s)

[see yeah so this is the guy here I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m24s)

[something in the back of my mind is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m27s)

[telling me](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m29s)

[that it's limited if you're on like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m31s)

[Community Visual Studio you don't get](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m34s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m37s)

[I it's not saying it here but I've got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m39s)

[that memory in my head and that memory](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m42s)

[could be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m44s)

[wrong so just just be aware of that and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m47s)

[intell code only works on C and python](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m50s)

[right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m52s)

[now though fully expect to have more](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m53s)

[languages](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m56s)

[supported uh soon because obviously AI](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h03m58s)

[is kind of a big deal and everybody's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m03s)

[all interested in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m05s)

[that okay collection view now works um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m08s)

[so the one thing I also want to do is I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m13s)

[want to switch up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m16s)

[I want to do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m22s)

[this this and then edit the collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m24s)

[and make sure it still works because it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m27s)

[should be raising collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m29s)

[changed and I want to confirm that that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m31s)

[still works so this is worst possible](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m34s)

[scenario uh let's see JC uh in WPF when](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m38s)

[you have an item view model created from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m41s)

[a factory from a data grid how does the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m43s)

[item communicate with the main view uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m46s)

[model uh EG uh drawer host and send data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m49s)

[to the bound fields on the host ah great](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m53s)

[question so this comes up a lot with a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h04m56s)

[um anytime you're working with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m00s)

[collections of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m02s)

[items uh you did item view model and R](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m04s)

[toply oh good I left an example let's go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m07s)

[take a look because I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m08s)

[think uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m11s)

[actually why am](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m14s)

[I why don't I just open up my actual](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m16s)

[repo that sounds like a better](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m19s)

[idea and we'll take a quick look because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m22s)

[this guy looks like he's now working and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m24s)

[done so while ropley opens uh create](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m26s)

[Branch uh let's see tree list](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m31s)

[view uh collection view boom okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m35s)

[let's just real quick check the changes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m40s)

[that's a namespace](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m45s)

[delete uh I'm going to discard that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m46s)

[change but that's now just a unit test](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m48s)

[added control code behind for the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m52s)

[control inside of here the collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m55s)

[change to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h05m58s)

[non-generic these changes are pretty](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m00s)

[safe because the compiler would yell if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m02s)

[they were wrong which is great tree list](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m03s)

[view similar](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m06s)

[changes dropping the generics fixing the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m08s)

[nullability](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m11s)

[dropping the generics great and then the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m12s)

[test to go with it okay uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m15s)

[let's see uh fixing tree list view to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m19s)

[work with non generic](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m23s)

[collections uh specifically I collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m28s)

[view boom do that drag drop push and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m35s)

[pull request do that from local branch](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m40s)

[to pull request in one drag drop](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m44s)

[operation booah and then I just open](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m47s)

[this up real quick I come down here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m50s)

[enable auto merge enable auto merge okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m53s)

[rent](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m54s)

[ople](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m55s)

[uh because we have item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h06m59s)

[view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m03s)

[yeah so down in here I assume something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m06s)

[like this is what you are uh referring](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m09s)

[to so there's a couple ways you can go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m12s)

[about doing this cuz if I remember](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m14s)

[correctly this guy it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m16s)

[a yeah so I have a factory pattern that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m20s)

[actually creates them and I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m23s)

[one of these guys here has yeah my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m26s)

[collection so this guy builds up a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m28s)

[collection uses a factory when he wants](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m30s)

[to add more collection](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m32s)

[synchronization](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m34s)

[yeah um and then we we populate them so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m36s)

[the the common pattern of going through](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m40s)

[and dealing with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m42s)

[it is is twofold so so one possible](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m43s)

[choice because this is on the the data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m50s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m53s)

[itself is cuz where is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m54s)

[the yeah this button here so you can so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h07m58s)

[the the rows in the data grid are are](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m03s)

[each of the the individual items right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m06s)

[and so you can do something like this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m08s)

[button here where it does a relative](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m10s)

[binding and says well I don't really](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m13s)

[want the command on my individual](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m15s)

[item so for example the the delete](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m19s)

[command we really want this up at a oh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m22s)

[stupid don't do that uh we really want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m26s)

[this up at the top level where we can um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m29s)

[and I guess we actually didn't even](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m33s)

[Implement delete we really want this up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m34s)

[at the the top level because we want the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m37s)

[delete to be able to act on the entire](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m39s)

[collection not on an individual item so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m41s)

[in this case rather](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m45s)

[than uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m47s)

[rather than trying to have the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m48s)

[individual item communicate up in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m50s)

[view model layer we deal with it in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m52s)

[view and we relative Source are binding](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m55s)

[to an element higher than the individual](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h08m58s)

[item in this case the data grid um you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m01s)

[never really want a relative Source](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m03s)

[binding outside of your xaml file so in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m05s)

[this case we're going from a cell up to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m08s)

[the grid itself no biggie right the data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m10s)

[grid uh knows that it's going to have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m13s)

[the collection of items and then you do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m15s)

[this path data context dot because your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m17s)

[relative Source binding changes the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m20s)

[source of your binding to the UI object](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m22s)

[and so then we just have to go data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m24s)

[context delete command so option](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m26s)

[one consider a relative Source binding](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m28s)

[or similar right you relative Source](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m32s)

[could be replaced with like element name](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m34s)

[binding if you want to do do that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m35s)

[approach as well that's that's an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m37s)

[option um and then we pass the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m39s)

[individual item through to the command](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m43s)

[as a command parameter because obviously](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m45s)

[for like a delete you want to be able to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m47s)

[pass it up the other way you can go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m49s)

[through and do it and inside of here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m51s)

[if you have something inside the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h09m57s)

[item itself the pub sub approach with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m00s)

[the messenger is another one that I very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m03s)

[much enjoy doing this one may this one I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m06s)

[think is the more general purpose](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m09s)

[pattern for doing the communication you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m11s)

[can always do something where you do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m14s)

[like you know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m17s)

[public uh event event handler you know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m19s)

[thing happened right like you you can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m25s)

[always you can always do something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m28s)

[this um and then you can have the parent](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m30s)

[view model watch for the event and all](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m33s)

[of that stuff and then this guy just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m35s)

[raises the event and it propagates up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m36s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m39s)

[is kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m40s)

[obnoxious um if you go with the event](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m43s)

[approach you have to be really careful](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m46s)

[about memory leaks because it's very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m48s)

[easy to register for an event and keep](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m51s)

[an object alive when you didn't intend](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m53s)

[to so I like the the the IM messenger um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h10m55s)

[specifically in mine we register up the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m00s)

[the iMessenger with the weak reference](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m03s)

[Handler there is a strong reference one](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m06s)

[as well um but in general the weak](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m08s)

[reference one is the the preferred](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m11s)

[option because then the things can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m13s)

[register for messages with without](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m16s)

[actually uh bringing it out uh trying to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m18s)

[add data to the item by selecting from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m21s)

[another DB](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m24s)

[table add data to the item by selecting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m26s)

[another from another DB table oh like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m29s)

[you want additional column so for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m31s)

[example in this case I've got a a rental](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m33s)

[item view model but I want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m37s)

[get um maybe like a list of who things](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m39s)

[are loaned out to type situation I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m43s)

[guessing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m47s)

[um if I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m51s)

[was I I assume something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m54s)

[that is reasonable let me I'm I'm trying](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h11m57s)

[to remember my data model board](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m00s)

[games](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m03s)

[uh yeah for example this doesn't this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m05s)

[doesn't this doesn't include the board](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m08s)

[game that was actually rented so that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m10s)

[that's not great so if we uh so if we do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m12s)

[something like uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m16s)

[games and actually I would probably go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m19s)

[like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m21s)

[this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m22s)

[um observable property so one real](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m24s)

[simple option is you could actually just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m28s)

[say you know what what I really want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m32s)

[do here is I want the the factory to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m34s)

[pass in an additional object right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m38s)

[that's a thing you could do so depending](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m40s)

[on where you need to do the the quering](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m43s)

[from you can always just have the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m46s)

[Factory pass in as many objects as you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m48s)

[want because your view model can kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m50s)

[massage multiple sources of data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m53s)

[together to to get to what you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m55s)

[need um what is your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h12m58s)

[problem cannot be used as it's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m00s)

[containing type does not Implement from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m03s)

[observable object well let's fix that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m05s)

[observable object the other one here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m08s)

[uh for example if we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m11s)

[do uh relay command uh public](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m13s)

[async task load games right we do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m18s)

[something like this and then we could do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m24s)

[something where it's await uh board game](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m26s)

[context uh board](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m31s)

[games](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m34s)

[um I I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m41s)

[something bad to list a sync come up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m44s)

[with better query uh VAR](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m48s)

[games all right and then we could do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m52s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m54s)

[games uh gets uh oh thank you co-pilot](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m55s)

[you are way too showing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h13m59s)

[off right so you you could end up doing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m02s)

[something akin to this where you have](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m05s)

[the relay command loaded in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m08s)

[now it gets mildly more Awkward um if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m11s)

[you do need to for example say this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m16s)

[loading doesn't make sense to be in the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m19s)

[individual item and instead this loading](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m21s)

[lives up on the parent already so option](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m24s)

[one the parent could pass the data in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m28s)

[after it gets](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m30s)

[loaded um let's let's let's just look at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m32s)

[that real quick so for example this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m35s)

[thing is loading up and creating those](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m38s)

[individual item view models right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m42s)

[there's no there's nothing stopping us](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m44s)

[from doing something like](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m46s)

[um uh iterating over this for each item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m48s)

[in uh rentals right and doing a query](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m54s)

[here and going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h14m58s)

[item stop it stop helping me if you're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m00s)

[going to help you got to do it right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m03s)

[co-pilot right so this this thing could](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m07s)

[have oh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m16s)

[games here right](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m18s)

[so the parent can always push the data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m21s)

[down either by passing it as a property](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m25s)

[or potentially increasing the Factory's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m28s)

[API surface so I cheated with a funk](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m31s)

[because it was really simple one thing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m34s)

[in one thing out there's nothing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m36s)

[stopping you from doing you know board](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m39s)

[game and having the factory take two](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m41s)

[things in there comes a point where if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m44s)

[you're adding a lot of parameters here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m48s)

[you might want to abandon the the cheap](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m50s)

[delegate approach and actually just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m52s)

[write yourself an interface for your](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m54s)

[factory with a real class um these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h15m56s)

[lightweight factories are great but](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m00s)

[there's also a certain point where](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m02s)

[they're probably not the right answer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m04s)

[the other thing that you can do is if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m07s)

[you if you actually write like a full](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m08s)

[Factory so for example](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m10s)

[U public interface](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m14s)

[uh I have changed the funk to factory oh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m18s)

[perfect uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m21s)

[rental](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m23s)

[Factory and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m25s)

[then right so we can do this and we can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m26s)

[go with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m29s)

[uh task](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m32s)

[of rental item view model create item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m34s)

[right and we can do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m39s)

[rental so the the other the other trick](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m40s)

[in here is o](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m45s)

[repo okay look at that in just a second](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m48s)

[I'm going to finish this uh public](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m51s)

[class](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m53s)

[rental](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m55s)

[Factory IR rental](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h16m57s)

[Factory is this guy here could also take](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m00s)

[in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m04s)

[the the the DB context as a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m07s)

[dependency and then once your factory](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m13s)

[takes in the DB cont text as a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m16s)

[dependency there's nothing stopping this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m19s)

[method from uh do more queries from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m21s)

[running whatever queries it needs to do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m27s)

[and then returning back a a new item](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m30s)

[view model that's very](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m33s)

[possible um but let's take a look](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m35s)

[at I want the phone view item to be able](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m41s)

[to add a Sim via button on there okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m44s)

[we're going to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m48s)

[here uh let's see probably](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m50s)

[application uh let's o](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m54s)

[entities so we've got Sim let's see Sim](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h17m56s)

[is a simple Poco ID phone number Sim](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m00s)

[number former user links](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m04s)

[great and uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m07s)

[phones okay uh phone view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m22s)

[item uh let's see hold on let's look at](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m28s)

[the factory real quick the factor is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m31s)

[already taking in the repository and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m33s)

[envelope so it takes in a view one phone](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m39s)

[does the repository phone items view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m42s)

[model okay sorry I realized I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h18m44s)

[ahead and look at it from this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m12s)

[perspective since launching that may end](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m13s)

[up being slightly more difficult okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m15s)

[here and we have the phone item view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m36s)

[model so we want a button in here and we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m40s)

[want to be able](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h25m42s)

[new and then we do that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m06s)

[maneuver and then it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m11s)

[launches](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m15s)

[oh except for I got to delete my other](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m17s)

[so I remember what we were doing we were](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m33s)

[adding a we were wanting to be able to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m35s)

[add a Sim](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m37s)

[via a button which I assume one of these](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m39s)

[buttons here is the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m42s)

[intent](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m45s)

[let's take a look at the view and the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m47s)

[data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m50s)

[grid let's see so what do we got new](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m52s)

[button got it when you click the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h27m58s)

[button so this guy goes](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m03s)

[here sorry I'm just looking at what we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m12s)

[have when you end up click the button is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m14s)

[the to be able to add a new](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m18s)

[sim I added the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m22s)

[new uh just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m25s)

[remove](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m27s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m30s)

[uh got it and do you already have like a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m35s)

[a drawer host or anything in here cuz](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m39s)

[this this guy here is the user control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m42s)

[which I assume if I look at Main](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m45s)

[window uh that's headed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m50s)

[view uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m53s)

[um uh had the new not on this repo got](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h28m57s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m01s)

[okay okay so the idea here then would be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m03s)

[um button with the intent to open up a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m07s)

[drawer host to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m10s)

[add stuff in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m12s)

[so okay um this seems straightforward](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m15s)

[enough um okay so we'll we'll go ahead](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m23s)

[and just do that real quick uh material](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m27s)

[design and then we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m32s)

[drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m34s)

[host and then I'm going to wing this and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m35s)

[make it up entirely as I go it'll be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m38s)

[great uh boom okay so step one we need](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m41s)

[to migrate up](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m44s)

[the grid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m48s)

[row off of there onto the drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m50s)

[host uh that's all fine that's all fine](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m53s)

[that's all fine okay we're going to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m57s)

[assume that works okay so then we're](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h29m58s)

[going to do something like uh material](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m00s)

[design right drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m03s)

[content](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m05s)

[and uh I should not be debugging while](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m08s)

[I'm doing this this is going to make my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m10s)

[life really miserable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m12s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m15s)

[and then we will do something like a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m17s)

[stack](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m19s)

[panel and something like a uh text block](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m26s)

[text add Sim something something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m28s)

[something and then we will do a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m31s)

[text uh box because we want to actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m35s)

[show doing the the data binding with](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m38s)

[this we will drop that guy in there uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m43s)

[we are going to do something like uh is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m47s)

[WR drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h30m50s)

[the top I imagine we've already](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m27s)

[got some useful spot so user control](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m30s)

[resources uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m35s)

[all the way](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m39s)

[in like view model will](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m41s)

[work uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m45s)

[uh actually hang on we could probably](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m47s)

[just let the auto code do it for me hey](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h32m50s)

[everything you're going to see here is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m17s)

[going to be uh this is a way to do it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m19s)

[it's not the only way to do it so I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m22s)

[going to do an observable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m25s)

[so we've got that that exists so when](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m52s)

[that guy is not null the right drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m55s)

[will open this thing will go in here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h33m57s)

[binding selected phone for edit so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m03s)

[you'll note I've created a bindable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m06s)

[property inside of the view model I'm](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m08s)

[using the presence of it to determine](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m12s)

[whether I open or close the right drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m14s)

[inside of the right drawer I am setting](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m17s)

[um the data context of kind of the top](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m19s)

[level control and then](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m22s)

[text binding I don't know uh what was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m24s)

[one of the things that we set up on this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m27s)

[guy uh sure I'm just going to pick on a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m34s)

[property that has a value in it um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m37s)

[change it to something useful](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m41s)

[later um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m44s)

[T um and for this is probably the wrong](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m49s)

[data type I'm just realizing I made this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m54s)

[your model object not your view model](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h34m57s)

[object uh so I actually want it to be of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m01s)

[type view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m04s)

[model so we want to change that up real](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m05s)

[quick so that really should be that and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m09s)

[then back over here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m13s)

[here uh that then will change this to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m17s)

[oh probably the same okay good still](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m22s)

[lines up still works uh okay and then](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m24s)

[what we want to do here is in our data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m28s)

[grid we want to add something for](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m33s)

[um let's do](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m35s)

[a uh data grid uh template](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m38s)

[column uh let's see](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m43s)

[and then do you already have one in here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m46s)

[because it looked like you had started](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m49s)

[with some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m51s)

[for some buttons](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m52s)

[already yeah](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h35m57s)

[something something akin to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m00s)

[this something akin to this oh we'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m03s)

[kind of copy a bit of that come in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m06s)

[here there's all this it doesn't need a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m10s)

[next name music sort data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m13s)

[template button and then this is where](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m18s)

[I'm going to get um slightly fancier so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m21s)

[this is going to do the uh relative](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m26s)

[Source binding uh relative Source uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m28s)

[ancestor type uh data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m32s)

[grid and then we need a mode of find](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m37s)

[ancestor so this is the exact same as](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m42s)

[doing mode equals](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m44s)

[here but mode is the Constructor](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m47s)

[parameter for relative source so you can](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m50s)

[get away with that and then from](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m51s)

[here come up here and we'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m56s)

[do uh path data context Dot and then I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h36m58s)

[want to go not](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m04s)

[you uh let's see I want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m06s)

[a uh relay command we'll call it uh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m10s)

[private void](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m15s)

[uh edit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m16s)

[phone and then it'll be phones item view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m18s)

[model](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m22s)

[phone should probably make it notable](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m24s)

[and then uh selected phone for edit gets](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m27s)

[phone that's](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m31s)

[it back over](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m33s)

[here phone command and then I want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m36s)

[the command parameter to be the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m40s)

[individual](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m42s)

[item and then](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m50s)

[uh I don't know we're going to do it's a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m52s)

[good icon](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m55s)

[edit Circle yay okay um is enabled we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h37m58s)

[don't need because we have a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m03s)

[command uh that's fine and we're going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m05s)

[to change this to edit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m08s)

[phone something about like that see if](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m12s)

[it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m16s)

[works okay so we go phones](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m25s)

[now Okay so we've got one guy here we've](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m27s)

[got a little](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m30s)

[button uh when we click](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m32s)

[it uh let's see phone uh view model was](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m35s)

[not recognized](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m39s)

[as a valid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m41s)

[Boolean that sounds like I botched](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m44s)

[something in my](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m47s)

[converter because that should have gone](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m51s)

[here oh](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h38m58s)

[the uh the other plausibility is the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m00s)

[thing probably data bound two way and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m04s)

[broke let's go here let's go](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m08s)

[here uh so where where is this call Stat](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m13s)

[coming](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m16s)

[from edit](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m17s)

[phone so that is going](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m24s)

[there so we apply the value data](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m27s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m31s)

[convert oh it landed on the wrong](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m39s)

[converter dang it see this is why I need](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m42s)

[to not expose these converters because](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m45s)

[they are hosing me](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m48s)

[over uh let's see not null](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m50s)

[converter and then we want to come back](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m54s)

[down see that's a not converter not a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h39m59s)

[not null converter those are not the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m02s)

[same](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m04s)

[converter let's try this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m05s)

[again](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m10s)

[okay there we go now we're actually](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m12s)

[hitting our converter](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m14s)

[has](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m16s)

[uh okay so we come over here we click](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m17s)

[the button you'll note we now have our](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m22s)

[A1 asset](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m25s)

[tag and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m28s)

[then well in that case it tried to it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m31s)

[tried to update it and then prly crashed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m34s)

[so yeah there's some work that's needed](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m36s)

[um this is also potentially](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m42s)

[um this](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m44s)

[is so things that you that you may want](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m48s)

[to consider so this is kind of a basic](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m52s)

[pattern of how you could go about doing](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m54s)

[it obviously you want to build out](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m56s)

[everything in your drawer to be whatever](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h40m59s)

[editing control you want to be the other](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m01s)

[thing that's quite common that I've done](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m03s)

[in a lot of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m05s)

[cases is this property here is the same](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m06s)

[object as the items in your data grid](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m12s)

[they don't](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m14s)

[they don't have to be uh yeah I can I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m16s)

[can fork and PR this back to you here in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m19s)

[just a second um because quite often](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m21s)

[what I have found is the the object that](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m24s)

[you want in your list may only contain a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m26s)

[a a handful of properties but when you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m29s)

[actually get into like your edit view](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m32s)

[you want the full object type situation](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m33s)

[so if you run into that this this set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m38s)

[this Setter right here where it's just](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m42s)

[directly assigning it doesn't have to be](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m44s)

[so simple right this could be a you know](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m46s)

[get the full item and have this selected](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m50s)

[phone for edit be a a you know an](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m52s)

[editable phone view model or whatever it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m55s)

[needs to be and this is just kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h41m58s)

[feeding the data into it so I've made](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m01s)

[this a oneliner out of Simplicity but in](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m03s)

[a lot of cases when building out kind of](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m06s)

[this this um uh what what is it the the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m08s)

[list details pan type interaction which](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m12s)

[is kind of what you're describing here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m15s)

[it's very common for there to be some](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m17s)

[sort of data transformation that occurs](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m18s)

[here to get more](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m20s)

[stuff um for what it's worth uh okay so](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m22s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m28s)

[that and there](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m29s)

[is okay so let me just check what I've](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m33s)

[done okay so I need to put this on a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m37s)

[branch I can't push to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m40s)

[yours directly but what I can do is I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m43s)

[can Fork](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m46s)

[this uh create a fork uh copy the main](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m47s)

[branch only shirt so this will be a good](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m51s)

[lesson in get where you've just cloned a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m53s)

[repo willy-nilly and you realize ah](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m55s)

[shoot now I want to make a branch and](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m58s)

[pull request back okay so step one copy](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h42m59s)

[my new remote get Kraken we come in here](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m03s)

[because you'll see that I only have a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m07s)

[single remote here and so you'll note](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m09s)

[get Kraken very help and it'll](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m14s)

[automatically find my git repo if you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m16s)

[don't have that you could come and set](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m18s)

[it here but we're going to leverage the](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m19s)

[the nice git remote and we'll add](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m21s)

[that boom and then we will create a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m24s)

[branch and we will call it something](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m27s)

[like uh add edit uh drawer that sounds](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m29s)

[like a good Branch so we come in here we](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m36s)

[go stage all changes great uh example](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m38s)

[adding edit drawer](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m42s)

[now the the key thing here is this is a](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m47s)

[local branch and so in my case I want to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m50s)

[make sure that I set the Upstream](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m52s)

[appropriately so you'll note it defaults](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m55s)

[to origin I want to make sure that it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m57s)

[goes to mine the other thing is when you](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h43m59s)

[go to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h44m00s)

[go to mine because I'm that's the one I](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h44m09s)

[know I'm going to have right access to](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h44m11s)

[okay so mine's there so now I've got it](https://youtu.be/jhAb2V56-fY?t=02h44m13s)
