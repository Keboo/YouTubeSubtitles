[colleague of mine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m20s)

[uh sent me the most brilliant](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m23s)

[little brain teaser Well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m28s)

[uh he did not word it in the form of a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m32s)

[brain teaser but that is functionally](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m35s)

[what it is So here is the net fiddle](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m37s)

[framework uh if you mean Avalonia which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m47s)

[is my favorite mobile framework at the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m50s)

[moment Uh because somebody else actually](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m53s)

[already did port material design and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m55s)

[ZAML to Avalonia So there's actually I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m56s)

[think it's called material.avaonia](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h05m59s)

[that's out there and it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m01s)

[it's actually a yeah this guy right here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m06s)

[So somebody already beat me to the punch](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m09s)

[and they did a remarkably good job at it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m12s)

[So I submitted a couple PRs to it It](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m15s)

[doesn't it like this is based upon a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m17s)

[slightly older version of the library](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m19s)

[but what's there is great So yeah I know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m22s)

[hours in a day That's it That's all I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m31s)

[asking for Uh okay Where did my Where](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m33s)

[did my net fiddle go okay So here here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m37s)

[is the C kind of brain teaser thing to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m40s)

[think through for a moment And I'll make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m43s)

[this a little bigger So a few things I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m45s)

[going to I'm going to just I'm going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m47s)

[go down here real quick So class with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m48s)

[event is shockingly a class with an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m50s)

[event Okay the event delegate type is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m54s)

[declared as action and there's a little](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h06m58s)

[helper boole on here that just says is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m00s)

[event null that checks is the event null](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m03s)

[I know this is shockingly good naming Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m05s)

[okay So here's what we got We got this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m09s)

[event register class and then two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m12s)

[instances of class with event We pass](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m14s)

[the first instance into update one on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m16s)

[this register class So what does update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m19s)

[one do so update one right takes in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m21s)

[new instance And I'll have you take](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m26s)

[special note of this m equals 3 Okay we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m28s)

[check if there is a previous instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m32s)

[And if there is we'll go ahead and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m35s)

[unregister](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m36s)

[We then take the new instance and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m38s)

[register up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m40s)

[we cache the instance into something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m42s)

[called last instance or previous](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m45s)

[instance and that's the end of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m47s)

[function Right so if we were to pass](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m49s)

[this same thing in twice what we would](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m51s)

[expect is that uh there would only ever](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m54s)

[be a single registration right the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h07m57s)

[setup here is uh we only want one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m00s)

[registration here on this and we've got](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m03s)

[this last instance Okay so we we call](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m05s)

[update one passing first we call update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m07s)

[one passing second and after each of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m10s)

[these invocations we check which one has](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m12s)

[a null event So in C when an event has](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m14s)

[no registrations on it it is null When](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m17s)

[it does have registrations it will be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m20s)

[non-null right multiccast delegate is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m22s)

[the the fancy word you can put into the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m24s)

[Googles](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m26s)

[Okay we come down here We're going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m28s)

[change out um the instances for brand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m31s)

[new clean instances of both the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m34s)

[register class and then two class with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m37s)

[events Then we're going to call update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m39s)

[two and basically do exactly what we did](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m41s)

[above So what does update 2 do update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m43s)

[two does almost the same exact thing as](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m47s)

[update one It checks the previous](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m50s)

[instance It unregisters if it found one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m53s)

[It then registers a new handler and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h08m57s)

[caches the last instance Now we are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m00s)

[reusing the same field from the other](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m02s)

[method but remember we got a new](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m04s)

[instance of this class right before we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m06s)

[went into the update to code So there is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m08s)

[no cross talk between those And the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m11s)

[difference here is this local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m14s)

[here right writes out that local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m17s)

[variable m whereas this local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m19s)

[here writes out just the string m](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m21s)

[because I was feeling funny](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m25s)

[Now the important thing here is to note](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m28s)

[now the the the section down here in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m31s)

[update one's case](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m35s)

[we expect after the first call that one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m38s)

[is false and one is true because we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m40s)

[registered up on the event on one of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m42s)

[instances right so first is the one that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m45s)

[we passed in first and so its event is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m48s)

[not null meaning there is a registration](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m51s)

[perfect right second is null false but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m54s)

[when we get to the second one both of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m57s)

[them have a registration](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h09m59s)

[which implies that the unregister right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m02s)

[this guy here on update one did not work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m05s)

[now if we look down here at update two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m09s)

[we'll see that first is null second is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m12s)

[first is null is false which makes sense](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m16s)

[the first instance got a registration](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m18s)

[second is null true because it has not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m21s)

[been registered yet but then when we do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m23s)

[the second call we'll note that these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m25s)

[two uh invert First does go to null It](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m28s)

[has been properly unregistered But](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m32s)

[second is false It does have a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m35s)

[registration So this is the brain teaser](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m37s)

[Why](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m42s)

[why is it that this local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m44s)

[doesn't properly unregister](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m48s)

[but this one does](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m51s)

[that that is the key key question right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m54s)

[and this this is where it gets really](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h10m59s)

[really interesting So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m02s)

[I'm going to pause for a moment if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m04s)

[anybody wants to go play with this The](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m06s)

[the net fiddle is is here And then I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m10s)

[going to go rebase and do it And then in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m13s)

[a little bit we'll look at the answer](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m15s)

[because this this was a fun one This was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m16s)

[an absolute like as soon as my colleague](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m20s)

[sent this to me I started laughing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m23s)

[because I I I stared at it for a minute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m24s)

[and went "Hang on hang on." And then it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m26s)

[clicked and and then I was like "Oh this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m29s)

[is brilliant." Um and then he was like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m32s)

["Can you explain what's going on?" I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m34s)

[like "Absolutely not I am stealing this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m36s)

[as a brain teaser." So and then I I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m38s)

[promptly poached his net fiddle which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m41s)

[was which was perfect right so this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m43s)

[this is gold This is gold Okay in terms](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m46s)

[of that let's go enhance mouse over](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m50s)

[visual](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m52s)

[right so same as 383 which I think we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m54s)

[reviewed a stream or two ago but for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m57s)

[listbox item uh the material design](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h11m59s)

[specs in interactive demo suggested the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m01s)

[cursor should be the the hand when](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m03s)

[hovering over a list box item which I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m06s)

[believe is correct I believe is correct](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m08s)

[Yeah So cursor hover shows this item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m11s)

[here Though I do wonder if this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m15s)

[expected for the checkbox](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m18s)

[No because this is the hover state](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m22s)

[provides a visual cue that the element](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m24s)

[is interactive](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m26s)

[Yep this seems accurate Where was I here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m28s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m33s)

[let's see There's an interactive demo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m35s)

[here too Lovely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m37s)

[Uh though there is one subtle thing that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m39s)

[we've done here right so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m41s)

[point something out Right So material](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m43s)

[design 3 is tab one Material design two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m45s)

[is the interactive demo Now I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m48s)

[think there's anything of significance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m50s)

[here but it is something to keep in mind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m52s)

[right and so this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m54s)

[it does show the hand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h12m58s)

[icon](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m00s)

[though it doesn't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m02s)

[doesn't show the ripple which is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m04s)

[giving me a little bit of pause](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m08s)

[but yes Okay Regardless I think this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m11s)

[fine The big question will be on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m14s)

[implementation Let's see Review code and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m16s)

[suggest changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m19s)

[Oh uh ensure the remote is not hidden](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m23s)

[Well it probably is It probably is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m26s)

[because I unfortunately hid a lot of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m29s)

[remotes Let's see I need Corv's not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m31s)

[hidden](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m34s)

[Okay you know it aired but at least it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m36s)

[gave me a useful error That's that's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m39s)

[what's important I I if it um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m42s)

[Okay so let's see here So we've got on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m50s)

[the theme itself we are setting the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m52s)

[cursor And the key thing here is we're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m54s)

[setting the cursor inside of a style uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m56s)

[inside of a style setter which allows](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h13m59s)

[anyone to overwrite it either with a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m02s)

[derived style or simply by uh applying](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m04s)

[um a direct property assignment to the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m09s)

[list box item itself Either one works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m12s)

[Okay And so what we have done is we've](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m16s)

[added an attached property which is here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m18s)

[I'm going to move myself to the left](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m22s)

[just to make sure I don't get in the way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m24s)

[And then this needs to be bigger so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m26s)

[people can actually see it And drag this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m28s)

[to the side](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m30s)

[Uh why do I not have a split on this one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m32s)

[that's kind of annoying Don't I get a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m36s)

[split nah that'll work Uh okay And so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m38s)

[the key thing that I am looking for here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m41s)

[uh when looking at attached properties I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m44s)

[am always looking for owner type to make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m47s)

[sure that it is properly set I am](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m49s)

[looking at property metadata](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m52s)

[specifically for anything that uses](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m53s)

[framework property metadata that might](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m55s)

[be set to inherited because that may or](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m57s)

[may not uh be useful Uh but this seems](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h14m59s)

[fairly simple right list box item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m03s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m09s)

[pulls down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m11s)

[Yeah this is basically exactly as I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m16s)

[would expect Ooh does this explain](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m20s)

[button work on the Oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m24s)

[look at that Oh I am in heaven I am in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m27s)

[heaven Get cracking Thank you You just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m32s)

[made my life significantly easier](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m35s)

[Let's see here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m42s)

[Uh how did it do introduces this That's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m45s)

[an accurate summary Added attach](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m47s)

[property list box item assist Uh modify](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m49s)

[to bind the cursor property of listbox](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m53s)

[item to the listbox item cursor property](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m55s)

[on the ancestor listbot Set the default](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h15m59s)

[for listbox item to be cursor.hand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m01s)

[Impact introduces a new way to customize](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m03s)

[the cursor when hovering over listbox](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m05s)

[item elements which can improve user](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m07s)

[experience I really wish you would drop](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m10s)

[off the witch Like I only care about the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m12s)

[what I don't like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m14s)

[co or I guess this isn't copilot I think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m16s)

[this is Gemini But this is not like I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m19s)

[don't want the why Darn it Just the what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m22s)

[Thank you Uh let's see The default](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m24s)

[cursor for list box item is now hand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m26s)

[This could potentially affect existing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m29s)

[applications that relied on the default](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m31s)

[cursor No breaking changes are apparent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m33s)

[This is beautiful Now it's correct but I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m36s)

[am going to uh we have a label in this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m41s)

[uh project for visual breaking changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m45s)

[Um okay so I would like to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m49s)

[uh view pull request on GitHub please](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m53s)

[because I need to label this thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m56s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m58s)

[So for my release notes I want to make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h16m59s)

[sure this hits the release notes and I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m03s)

[want it to label it as a visual breaking](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m05s)

[change](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m07s)

[And](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m09s)

[we are going to merge that sucker](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m12s)

[There we go And so just with my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m15s)

[automation putting these on here will](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m17s)

[make sure that it shows up in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m19s)

[release notes under the visual breaking](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m21s)

[change collection because in my opinion](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m23s)

[when people update their apps they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m26s)

[people care about this It's not an API](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m28s)

[breaking change but if we change the way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m30s)

[somebody's control looks or behaves](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m31s)

[people will want to know about it in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m34s)

[case they would like to go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m35s)

[and override it or similar right they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m38s)

[could go write their own listbox item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m40s)

[style and set it back to the default if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m41s)

[that's if that's what they want Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m44s)

[that handles that Let's go here And now](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m47s)

[that I know that I have the fancy button](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m51s)

[Oh yeah we are totally hitting the fancy](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m53s)

[button](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m55s)

[Go on impress me](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h17m57s)

[Let's see Implements multi selection for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m02s)

[and fixes collapsing The fact that it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m04s)

[has an and is interesting to me Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m06s)

[because we have a lot of tests around](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m10s)

[this So I'll be curious what cued that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m11s)

[in Uh let's see Add support for multiple](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h18m13s)

[going to take me I thought it was going](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h19m48s)

[to be a streamer too I was an idiot So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h19m51s)

[but we got it done In my opinion it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h19m56s)

[one of the coolest and best controls in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h19m58s)

[the library etc etc etc Okay so let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m02s)

[see Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m06s)

[uh oh I like I like this I like this So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m10s)

[warning me of changes here on app.zaml](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m16s)

[Um let's see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m22s)

[So in the domain but this is inside the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m25s)

[demo Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m27s)

[added an observable collection I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m31s)

[care as much about the demo though This](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m33s)

[one here is interesting to me Let's see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m35s)

[Uh demo trees and demo trees I This is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m38s)

[one of the things that I love right i](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m42s)

[like when the AI intelligently groups](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m44s)

[things together for me This is what AI](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m47s)

[should be doing It should be giving me a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m49s)

[concise list so I don't have to look at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m52s)

[everything right i want it to clump and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m55s)

[tell me about the stuff Uh let's see A](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h20m57s)

[list box is added the selected items to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m00s)

[enable their removal](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m02s)

[Wait what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m05s)

[modify the ZAML to selected items uh to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m07s)

[the view model A list box is added to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m10s)

[display the selected items and enable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m12s)

[their removal Interesting We might go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m14s)

[fire up the demo app and take a look](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m16s)

[then because that's an interesting way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m18s)

[to do it if that is in fact true Let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m20s)

[see Implemented the selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m23s)

[dependency probably including change](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m25s)

[notification synchronization logic to to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m27s)

[maintain consistency between the visual](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m30s)

[selection and the selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m32s)

[collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m34s)

[Um fixes a bug where collapsing a node](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m36s)

[would remove this And this is where it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m39s)

[gets interesting because the way this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m40s)

[multi- select tree view works is it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m43s)

[doesn't use a tree view It uses a list](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m45s)

[view and then indents child items based](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m48s)

[upon where they're at in the tree So it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m51s)

[looks a lot like a tree view but it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m54s)

[not a tree view It's a list view And](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m56s)

[because it's a list view you get things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h21m58s)

[like virtualization which gets to be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m00s)

[very interesting because that means that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m03s)

[as you scroll the UI items may fall off](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m06s)

[the the tree and not exist in the um the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m09s)

[visual tree for the Zamble which gets to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m13s)

[be very interesting and you get all](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m16s)

[kinds of fun problems Added a modified](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m18s)

[test for the select items and collapsing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m21s)

[behavior Let's see behavioral changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m23s)

[Tree list now supports multi- selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m26s)

[Collapsing a par node no longer clears](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m28s)

[the selection of child nodes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m31s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m34s)

[This gives me pause We we may want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m37s)

[look at this because this there was some](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m39s)

[very very specific log sheets that may](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m41s)

[not have been apparent inside of there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m43s)

[Dependencies affected Uh tree list views](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m45s)

[behavior related to selection has been](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m48s)

[significantly altered Code relying on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m49s)

[the previous single selection behavior](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m52s)

[will need to be updated](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m54s)

[Maybe](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m56s)

[um we will see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h22m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m01s)

[and potential minor performance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m06s)

[Interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m08s)

[Okay Okay Let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m10s)

[let us take a look](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m15s)

[Um let's see here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m18s)

[How do I get out of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m20s)

[How do I get out of this one file back](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m24s)

[There we go Oh that's interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m26s)

[because the explain is over the top of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m29s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m32s)

[That is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m37s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m40s)

[Interesting Interesting Interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m42s)

[Interesting Interesting I'm not sure I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m43s)

[actually like that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m46s)

[I would like to be able to have access](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m48s)

[to the explain as well as being able to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m50s)

[go through the PR at the same time](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m53s)

[That's kind of obnoxious Okay Uh let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h23m56s)

[see So these are just an observable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m00s)

[collection and a command inside of a a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m02s)

[demo app Don't care Indentation on a for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m05s)

[loop to make it consistent Don't care](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m08s)

[Same with these things This is just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m10s)

[formatting Don't care Remove item checks](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m12s)

[the item's type removes I'm in the way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m17s)

[Let's see Command has an implementation](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m22s)

[brings in an item Checks his type Calls](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m25s)

[remove from the observable collection No](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m26s)

[problem This is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m28s)

[I agree with the AI This looks like an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m32s)

[unrelated change](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m34s)

[So this one here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m40s)

[this is the only thing that bothers me](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m42s)

[is I kind of want to be able to jump](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m43s)

[straight out into GitHub to leave the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m45s)

[comments but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m48s)

[I think we're going to go run the demo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m51s)

[app first Uh this is entirely in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m52s)

[demo app](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h24m56s)

[I'm looking to see where that list box](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m00s)

[was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m03s)

[that it was talk Let's go side by side](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m06s)

[on this I think this will be easier to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m09s)

[read Uh let's see So we've got a tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m11s)

[list view some whites space indentation](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m14s)

[and cleanup which is all fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m16s)

[Group box](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m20s)

[So this is showing the tree view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m21s)

[selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m23s)

[which is bound to the same collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m28s)

[which is fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m30s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m32s)

[it has a little uh icon on there to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m36s)

[delete individual items out of there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m39s)

[I'm kind of wondering why we did a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m44s)

[separate list box rather than just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m46s)

[putting this straight into the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m47s)

[because we already had a template up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m54s)

[here I'm kind of wondering if it makes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m55s)

[more sense just to put the little bin](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m56s)

[icon right inside of there But I guess](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h25m58s)

[this is partially showing off the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m00s)

[selected items as well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m02s)

[That's fine Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m05s)

[yeah I mean it's it's fine There's not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m11s)

[there's nothing inherently wrong with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m13s)

[that I assume this is going to look real](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m14s)

[similar Yep Assume this is going to look](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m16s)

[real similar](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m19s)

[Yep](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m22s)

[Um the foreground red I guess this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m23s)

[just on the icon That's probably fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m26s)

[Hey Izzy Uh we are taking a re uh a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m28s)

[quick gander at uh PR out on the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m32s)

[material design library](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m36s)

[specifically this treeview](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m38s)

[uh selected items It's one I think I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m40s)

[briefly mentioned last stream but was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m44s)

[diving into and actually going to look](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m47s)

[at At some point we are going to um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m49s)

[get the T-Unit stuff going here in a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m55s)

[moment again as well Okay Uh one thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h26m57s)

[I'm noticing here So one when I see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m00s)

[internal that gives me a bit of pause](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m02s)

[This one I know why it's internal This I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m06s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m09s)

[This looks a bit state flaggy which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m11s)

[gives me pause and a default value that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m14s)

[is technically not necessary but not a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m17s)

[big deal So let's see We have selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m19s)

[items property](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m22s)

[So if the sender the dependency object](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m25s)

[of the change which tree list view which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m27s)

[is which is what it should be right this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m30s)

[is the owner the dependency property](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m32s)

[every instance of d that comes in should](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m34s)

[be a tree list viewer derived class](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m36s)

[uh let's see checks if it's a uh notify](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m39s)

[collection changed event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m43s)

[and then registers up and then this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m46s)

[method here seems interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m50s)

[This registers on selection change So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m54s)

[I'll be interested to see the sync](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m57s)

[method here in a minute Preview](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h27m59s)

[selection change So keep the dependency](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m01s)

[property in sync when the UI selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m03s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m05s)

[Interesting Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m15s)

[I do I I do kind of wonder why](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m21s)

[maybe I'm missing something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m25s)

[because there is sort of selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m28s)

[I believe on the list view already Maybe](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m30s)

[I'm but I remember leaving a to-do as](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m33s)

[well So I I'm probably just not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m36s)

[remembering something completely So if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m38s)

[there's removed items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m40s)

[and it's not collapsing Oh I see Because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m43s)

[if we Oh this is probably why we need it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m46s)

[Because on the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m50s)

[because the way this tree view works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m54s)

[when an item is collapsed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m56s)

[um it is removed from its children are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h28m59s)

[removed from the visual tree If we don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m02s)

[keep track of these things separately we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m04s)

[end up lo they they'll disappear out](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m06s)

[That's probably what was intended there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m10s)

[I think that's what was intended](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m13s)

[Selected item selection changed Uh NB So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m16s)

[for people unfamiliar with seeing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m20s)

[something like this inside of a codebase](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m21s)

[uh NB is something I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m24s)

[exists outside of the United States but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m27s)

[at least in the United States um it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m29s)

[often used in legal documents It is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m32s)

[Latin for note which means uh pay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m35s)

[attention or note Well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m38s)

[it's something I picked up from an old](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m42s)

[mentor of mine and so I've done it a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m44s)

[decent amount in code bases and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m46s)

[sometimes people pick it up and think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m48s)

[that it's my initials despite that my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m50s)

[initials are not NB](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m52s)

[So you know there's that Kevin does not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m55s)

[have an N in it or a B Oh wait Kevin](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h29m59s)

[does have an N in it It's good that I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m03s)

[can remember how to spell my own name](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m05s)

[It's used in the UK too I see it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m07s)

[everywhere Okay good Okay perfect So we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m08s)

[So so the Americans probably took it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m11s)

[from the Brits and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m14s)

[brought brought it over because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m17s)

[I will say this uh the Americans are not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m20s)

[known for our Latin skills In fact I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m22s)

[think we are known for uh poaching](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m25s)

[little bits of language from a lot of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m27s)

[places](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m30s)

[and then messing it up and then claiming](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m34s)

[that it's our own](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m37s)

[I think that's roughly on point Uh let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m39s)

[see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m42s)

[See the base Yeah So this is what I was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m43s)

[wondering about The base selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m46s)

[only contains the visually selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m47s)

[items which means if it's virtualized](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m50s)

[and they fall off the visual tree we'll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m52s)

[lose them Um or if they are collapsed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h30m54s)

[Okay this this is going to be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m01s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m04s)

[Another one used is uh PS and PSS Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m06s)

[so PS I'm familiar with I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m11s)

[remember what it what it is in the Latin](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m13s)

[be but it's often used at the end of uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m16s)

[messages or emails at least here in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m20s)

[US It's PSS](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m22s)

[now I can't remember](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m25s)

[Let's see Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m37s)

[postcript is the PS But what is PSS](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m40s)

[hang on I will find it I have an acronym](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m46s)

[finder](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m48s)

[though The acronym finder is not being](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m51s)

[real helpful](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m54s)

[because I can I can just about guarantee](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h31m58s)

[some of these suggestions are definitely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m00s)

[not right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m02s)

[Uh oh Another postcript Oh got it Got it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m15s)

[Got it Got it Okay See I'm learning](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m20s)

[things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m22s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m26s)

[okay We're going to go into here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m29s)

[and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m32s)

[uh let's see We're going to start a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m43s)

[review](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m44s)

[Um and then this I think is fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m46s)

[Okay So let's look at the collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m51s)

[change So on a reset blows away reloads](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m53s)

[from the base collection I see So this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m57s)

[is actually reaching down into the base](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h32m59s)

[selected items to populate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m01s)

[our own](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m04s)

[This is interesting to me Oh this is the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m10s)

[other direction This is our observable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m15s)

[collection has changed Update the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m17s)

[underlying](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m20s)

[list view selected items Got it So on a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m22s)

[reset clear the items read anything](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m25s)

[that's still in there Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m28s)

[Uh do the old items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m31s)

[I wonder](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m35s)

[I'm trying to think if we if this could](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m38s)

[just be a collection expression with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m40s)

[just square brace square brace](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m42s)

[The is collapsing item So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m44s)

[this is interesting that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m51s)

[this feels weird](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m56s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h33m59s)

[this feels a little weird but we'll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m03s)

[we'll we'll go and play with it And then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m06s)

[only add if it's not already in there I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m09s)

[think that makes sense](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m12s)

[It it mostly makes sense](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m17s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m21s)

[the more S's on the end the more](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m22s)

[amendments have been added Uh usually](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m24s)

[used before rewriting official document](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m27s)

[as part of a review Oh okay Gotcha That](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m28s)

[makes sense because I've I've seen](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m32s)

[similar done where there's often a I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m34s)

[it's either I think it's called a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m37s)

[revisions list or revisions table often](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m38s)

[that I I've seen at the top of documents](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m40s)

[are similar But yeah that makes sense](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m42s)

[So this bit here gives me a bit of pause](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m48s)

[only because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m50s)

[the item in this case is something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m53s)

[external to the library This is a you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m56s)

[know a person class from your app](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h34m59s)

[And one of the things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m03s)

[one of the thing or one of the reasons](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m07s)

[why I wrote my my tree list view the way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m09s)

[that I did is because the the app in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m13s)

[question had a use case where it wanted](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m16s)

[to be able to um track multiple the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m20s)

[same instance was added into the tree at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m26s)

[multiple points and each of those things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m28s)

[needed to be distinct](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m32s)

[This I think breaks that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m36s)

[because if I have two person classes and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m39s)

[I add them both into the tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m42s)

[at different spots and I go to select](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m48s)

[one I think this falls over So that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m51s)

[gives me that gives me pause there Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m54s)

[Sync UI selected with selected items So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h35m57s)

[we unregister so that we don't trigger a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m00s)

[bunch of changed events We blow away the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m02s)

[clear ones](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m04s)

[and then we bring them all in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m07s)

[Yeah And this one doesn't have the same](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m17s)

[contains logic So I think I I think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m18s)

[we've the fact that we've got different](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m21s)

[ways of adding in here I think is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m23s)

[potentially problematic](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m26s)

[But we will check](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m28s)

[Okay So what do we got here item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m31s)

[expanded change If a node which has a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m33s)

[select child is expanded added we need](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m35s)

[to visually select the child](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m38s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m41s)

[so we're expanding an item and then it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m45s)

[calls the sync UI collection So what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m47s)

[does that do if I expand a node and I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m50s)

[have children](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m53s)

[this clears the base selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h36m57s)

[and then reads from our known set](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m04s)

[That is an interesting way of doing it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m12s)

[It's probably logically correct but I do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m15s)

[wonder if we could be more intelligent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m18s)

[So for example we are inserting these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m23s)

[guys here at insert at level I do wonder](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m28s)

[if we could simply check if the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m31s)

[the selected items already contain the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m36s)

[child that was being added because I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m38s)

[believe it's this same item here and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m40s)

[then just toggled it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m43s)

[And then here's the use of is collapsing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m46s)

[item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m48s)

[because while collapsing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m53s)

[there is going to be a change in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m57s)

[selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h37m59s)

[because if an I so while collapsing if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m03s)

[an item was a child and is inside](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m05s)

[the idea is to not necessarily remove it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m09s)

[even though the selection has changed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m12s)

[This is probably fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m16s)

[I'm just wondering if a better solution](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m24s)

[is rather than the state flag if we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m26s)

[should unregister reregister during this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m29s)

[event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m31s)

[I'm wondering if that would be a a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m35s)

[cleaner approach I I just don't like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m36s)

[state flags I really don't They they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m39s)

[they oftentimes get very complex It's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m42s)

[not bad when there's only a few but the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m45s)

[moment the pattern grows it gets real](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m47s)

[ugly real fast](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m50s)

[Okay so the data binding example added](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m52s)

[selected items Great Added selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m55s)

[items Great I approve We need to be able](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h38m58s)

[to see those Uh let's see Implicit](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m00s)

[template added it in Implicit template](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m03s)

[added it in Treeview tests Okay this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m05s)

[where I'm really interested in seeing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m08s)

[this So let's see here cleaned up an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m09s)

[extra white space that was in the te](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m12s)

[test name right there Great That's fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m15s)

[Nothing of significance there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m18s)

[See whites space line cleanup Nothing of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m21s)

[significance there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m23s)

[Same thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m25s)

[I am surprised this didn't break any](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m28s)

[existing tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m31s)

[I'm real surprised at that I do think I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m34s)

[want to make sure we have a test that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m38s)

[covers same instance multiple times](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m40s)

[Let's see Tree list view Selecting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m44s)

[multiple items adds them](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m46s)

[to selected items User control type](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m50s)

[Get test controls Wait was this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m56s)

[something I did prior](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h39m58s)

[or is that just something further down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m01s)

[where is where is get test controls](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m04s)

[that's something I wrote previously](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m07s)

[Oh look at that Okay so it iterates](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m11s)

[through both of those whether it's an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m14s)

[implicit template or a data binding](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m16s)

[template H okay this is actually two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m17s)

[tests in one I accept](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m22s)

[Uh let's do this This makes it easier to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m27s)

[read Okay So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m31s)

[what do we got uh test recorder load](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m34s)

[user control Pull the sucker out Grab](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m36s)

[this This all matches Grabs item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m38s)

[Grabs item two Okay So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m40s)

[selecting multiple items adds them to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m43s)

[selected items So we leftclick on item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m46s)

[one Wait Set keyboard input to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m48s)

[control](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m53s)

[Leftclick on two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m55s)

[And then slight delay I assume this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h40m58s)

[to handle the ripple animations](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m00s)

[Then we clear the control key press Very](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m04s)

[important](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m06s)

[And then we assert on selected items And](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m09s)

[this is something Corbin's asked me](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m11s)

[about](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m13s)

[um because he was struggling to figure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m14s)

[out how to do uh ZAML test because his](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m16s)

[property is an eyeist uh ZAML test can't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m20s)

[serialize that back and forth between](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m23s)

[the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m27s)

[the WPF project and the test project So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m28s)

[it ends up uh just failing to generate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m31s)

[and won't build one This remote execute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m36s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m48s)

[so this goes through Uh the only thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m53s)

[that gives me a bit of pause is I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m57s)

[like if conditions because the the thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h41m59s)

[that gets weird is if the data context](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m02s)

[happens to get changed on one of those](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m05s)

[controls where neither of these ifs](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m06s)

[match this test starts failing without](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m08s)

[or starts passing without running any](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m12s)

[asserts](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m14s)

[That gives me a bit of pause of like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m16s)

[makes me feel makes me feel yucky It](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m20s)

[makes me feel yucky Um I'm slightly](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m22s)

[inclined to give both of the view models](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m26s)

[some common interface or something just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m28s)

[so I can hardcast both of them because I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m30s)

[would hate to to stop running asserts](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m33s)

[accidentally](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m35s)

[right and we could also probably do an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m37s)

[else- if here as well but I realize this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m39s)

[is kind of a weird one um because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m42s)

[effectively just checks the assert ones](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m45s)

[Okay When collapsing a parent node all](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m48s)

[child nodes are visually removed due to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m50s)

[its implementation from the list view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m52s)

[Selected child node should stay in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m55s)

[treeview selected items even when](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h42m57s)

[collapsing its parent I agree with that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m00s)

[statement](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m02s)

[Uh let's see Collapsing parent of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m05s)

[selected child does not remove it So we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m06s)

[go here We add some children to item two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m10s)

[We expand item two We click on item two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m14s)

[We also then click on the second child](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m20s)

[inside of item two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m26s)

[So we should have item two plus one of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m29s)

[its children selected We release the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m32s)

[control key](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m35s)

[and then we assert on selected items I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m37s)

[do want to double check that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m41s)

[I know I said that this assert should](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m44s)

[work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m47s)

[but I I I do want to make sure that on a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m48s)

[failure this actually I think remote](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m50s)

[execute propagates up the exception I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m53s)

[hope it does If not we'll be fixing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m56s)

[something Um so collapse the parent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h43m58s)

[and then assert on the selected items So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m03s)

[it brings this guy in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m06s)

[asserts that item two and child one in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m08s)

[it are both](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m11s)

[there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m13s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m16s)

[I think all of this is fine aside from](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m18s)

[the double instance case I don't think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m21s)

[the double instance case was well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m25s)

[captured in these tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m26s)

[because clearly the rest of these tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m30s)

[passed which means there is a blind spot](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m32s)

[in the tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m35s)

[So we need to address that So exit](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m37s)

[review Uh let's see here I would like to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m42s)

[check out that branch please](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m46s)

[Huzzah Thank you Get Kraken You are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m56s)

[wonderful And then we'll open the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h44m59s)

[demo app just to take a look at that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m03s)

[I want it to be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m13s)

[Demo apps](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m16s)

[That is start a project launch](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m20s)

[Just close my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m44s)

[email down to make sure I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m46s)

[accidentally pop it open That would be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m47s)

[embarrassing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m49s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m52s)

[Come on Okay so I believe it is under](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m55s)

[trees](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h45m57s)

[Okay so we have this guy here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m00s)

[So step one is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m05s)

[got I've got two items selected I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m10s)

[collapse](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m13s)

[I delete](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m15s)

[I expand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m17s)

[I mean it works the way I would expect](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m25s)

[I I I kind of like this the added list](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m34s)

[box on the side here only because it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m37s)

[gives me a nice easy way of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m40s)

[validating how this is working](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m43s)

[So if I do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m50s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m54s)

[So there is a bug here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h46m58s)

[when I if I'm just straight left](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m00s)

[clicking without doing control it's not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m02s)

[clearing these other items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m05s)

[right so collapse leftclick I would](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m10s)

[expect it to clear all the other ones So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m14s)

[that's that's a potential failure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m18s)

[Let me get um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m22s)

[get a notepad document going here real](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m25s)

[quick because I want to I want to make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m27s)

[sure I I capture all these So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m28s)

[controllclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m32s)

[uh multiple children](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m34s)

[uh leftclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m40s)

[single root item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m41s)

[uh that doesn't properly clear X](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m47s)

[That's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m51s)

[That's not bad I mean it th this is one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m53s)

[of the more complicated controls in this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m56s)

[library So like I'm actually impressed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h47m58s)

[that anybody](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m00s)

[see and it's only when they are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m04s)

[collapsed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m11s)

[we don't handle the case Right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m14s)

[So it's it's like once they're collapsed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m17s)

[and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m20s)

[nested](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m22s)

[it's just when we do a selection of a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m25s)

[single item without multi se without](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m27s)

[multi turned on we need to know that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m31s)

[they're that they're being replaced](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m34s)

[right so that's it is an interesting an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m38s)

[interesting one to solve](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m42s)

[Okay So that's fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m45s)

[Do this I want to add a whole](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m48s)

[mess of things All right So if I select](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m52s)

[you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m54s)

[and expand you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h48m56s)

[right if I click here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m03s)

[is virtualization turned on for this one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m10s)

[is the question](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m12s)

[Um let's see here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m16s)

[I think it's on Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m20s)

[yeah because data virtualization is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m27s)

[enabled on this tree view by for by](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m30s)

[default](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m32s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m44s)

[Yep That is 100% a problem](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m51s)

[That is 100% a problem So it should have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h49m59s)

[virtualization enabled I just want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m03s)

[confirm that with Snoop](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m05s)

[because I want to I just want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m08s)

[validate this thing's behavior The way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m10s)

[we check this is we come over here and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m12s)

[we zero in on this sucker](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m15s)

[and we go what is this top level item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m18s)

[if I look at its content](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m21s)

[uh test item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m25s)

[BV FN uh LW](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m30s)

[Oh it's because I didn't select the top](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m37s)

[one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m38s)

[It doesn't seem like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m42s)

[this thing is virtualizing the control](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m46s)

[And I'm somewhat shocked to see that cuz](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m52s)

[I thought it was on by default](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h50m55s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m01s)

[how many how many items do we have here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m02s)

[here to here is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m05s)

[Well I don't know But if I add a bunch](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m08s)

[of items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m11s)

[really the question that I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m14s)

[is can I add enough items to where this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m16s)

[ends up growing because how many are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m19s)

[displayed here is kind of up to the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m21s)

[virtualization engine Usually there's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m22s)

[enough to handle everything that's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m24s)

[displayed here plus a little bit of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m26s)

[buffer top and bottom Right so if I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m27s)

[refresh this sucker that's all fine If I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m30s)

[expand you scroll I clearly have a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m33s)

[significantly more items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m36s)

[Okay so virtualization is definitely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m44s)

[enabled](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m46s)

[content](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m50s)

[Yeah so the top one is this But if I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m54s)

[scroll back up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h51m57s)

[I thought I just saw it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m01s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m03s)

[something is wonky](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m09s)

[Something is wonky](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m17s)

[If I select this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m20s)

[then scroll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m22s)

[Fact that the scroll bar just did that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m24s)

[worries me](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m26s)

[Let's go back to the top](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m31s)

[Just want to see I I got it to disappear](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m46s)

[when I was scrolling before and I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m49s)

[know what I did](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m51s)

[and I I'm I'm just wondering if I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m53s)

[accidentally clicked off or similar](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h52m55s)

[I wonder if this is a change with this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h53m03s)

[already Let me double check](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m24s)

[If I flip over](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m28s)

[sorry this part I can't show because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m30s)

[not public](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m34s)

[So but I can jump into a DevOps repo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m38s)

[Oh interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h54m45s)

[interaction that starts with um this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h56m28s)

[the lack of that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m17s)

[DevOps support bit if people wouldn't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m20s)

[mind upvoting that that'd be cool](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m23s)

[a little wonky](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m32s)

[but I don't think that is also just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m35s)

[upfooted Thank you Izzy](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m38s)

[is very good about using that feedback](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m43s)

[page to figure out what to work on next](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m46s)

[like they absolutely do go through that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m50s)

[feedback things that are upvoted and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m53s)

[it's not necessarily if it gets the most](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m55s)

[up votes they're going to implement it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m57s)

[like it's balanced against you know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h57m59s)

[level of effort type situations as well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m00s)

[but it it definitely is one of their uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m03s)

[main indicators of what people are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m06s)

[interested in seeing and so they often](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m08s)

[times will um go through and look and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m12s)

[say oh like um work trees was a big one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m15s)

[that I think sat on one of the highest](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m19s)

[upvoted things for like a couple of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m21s)

[years and it was only because they're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m24s)

[like in order to supported it it had a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m27s)

[very fundamental change that was needed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m30s)

[Um which is part of where we get the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m33s)

[get CLI interaction stuff that came in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m35s)

[So it wasn't that they didn't want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m38s)

[implement work trees It was that they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m39s)

[were like "Well we want to but we've got](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m40s)

[this other stuff that's kind of a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m43s)

[prerec."](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m44s)

[Because I I talked to him about it I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m46s)

[like "I I get it." Like I'm a software](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m48s)

[engineer too I understand that it's e](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m50s)

[like I can write a two sentence feature](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m53s)

[that is not a two sentence](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m55s)

[implementation Like that's I get it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h58m57s)

[right So I understand that sometimes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m00s)

[lower voted things get bumped higher up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m02s)

[because it's like well yeah this is you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m04s)

[know maybe half the votes but it's also](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m07s)

[like a 10-minute change](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m10s)

[Maybe we just go and make those people](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m12s)

[happier](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m14s)

[No but I will say they they are they are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m16s)

[very good about taking feedback](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m18s)

[Um and I will I've got I've got side](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m20s)

[chats with with some people there as](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m24s)

[well So I will I will poke that at them](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m26s)

[as well and say pretty please](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m29s)

[Pretty please Okay So I don't think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m34s)

[that's bad I think just that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m37s)

[controlclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m40s)

[is the problematic case](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m44s)

[because that still works That still](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m47s)

[works I don't know that there's anything](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m49s)

[Oh I want to check the Yeah because it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m52s)

[doesn't clear those Um I want to I want](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m55s)

[to add a test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=00h59m58s)

[around this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m00s)

[because clearly all the tests passed to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m02s)

[get us to this point Um but I would like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m05s)

[to add one where there's duplicated](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m08s)

[instances in two places because I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m10s)

[think it's going to handle that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m13s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m16s)

[I kind of want to look at these tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m18s)

[real quick I thought oh tree list I was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m19s)

[like that's not enough tests Uh tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m23s)

[list view test I thought there was a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m25s)

[test in here specifically around](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m27s)

[duplicate instances because I know that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m30s)

[the the app that I built it for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m33s)

[specifically had that as a use case Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m35s)

[let's see I use the workspace as an easy](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m39s)

[way to track multiple repos for a system](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m41s)

[released instead of using uh a repo with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m44s)

[subreos Yeah No and that's that's a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m46s)

[great way to do it The other thing if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m48s)

[you haven't seen it Izzy if you haven't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m50s)

[seen it there's Oh you're going to love](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m52s)

[this Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m55s)

[the Get Kraken CLI](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h00m57s)

[So there's this guy here There's there's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m03s)

[um a feature that they are uh putting in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m06s)

[specifically for dealing with uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m11s)

[multiple repos Hey JC good morning Good](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m13s)

[morning Um so this this GK work create](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m17s)

[this is a very like this is one of those](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m21s)

[things where when when I first saw it I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m25s)

[was like that's a little weird but the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m28s)

[more I thought about it I was like this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m31s)

[this is a interesting way of solving a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m33s)

[common developer problem So like you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m36s)

[were saying multiple repos needing to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m38s)

[like coordinate stuff for a release](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m40s)

[right kind of a pain in the neck right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m43s)

[the the git Kraken CLI you can do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m46s)

[GK work create Um and you know the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m48s)

[string is kind of arbitrary right you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m52s)

[can you can make it be whatever you want](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m55s)

[It could be an issue number or just you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m56s)

[know foo Um but it goes through and you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h01m59s)

[can see that it based upon what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m03s)

[workspace you've set it up to follow So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m06s)

[if you've done GK what is it gk](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m08s)

[workspace select or similar um you can](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m10s)

[set a work a default one or there's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m13s)

[options here to to pick one but it will](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m15s)

[start a unit of work and as you make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m18s)

[changes to those repositories all of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m22s)

[those things get added into that unit of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m25s)

[work and then you can take those and you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m28s)

[can do say start pull request on the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m32s)

[unit of work and it then knows oh okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m35s)

[I've got changes in four separate repos](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m38s)

[Start pull request on all four repos](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m41s)

[right so you can start to get this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m45s)

[it takes the the standard like create](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m48s)

[branch make change open PR workflow and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m51s)

[multiplies it and you can have it target](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m56s)

[you know one to end repositories to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h02m59s)

[bring it across which is very slick very](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m02s)

[very slick Um I haven't had like I've](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m05s)

[played around with it but I haven't had](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m08s)

[a a good](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m11s)

[a a good real world use case because the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m13s)

[multi-reo project I was on I got kind of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m17s)

[shoehorned into doing stuff only on a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m19s)

[single repo and then it didn't like it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m21s)

[it's cool but I I would never use this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m24s)

[if there's only one repo at play right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m27s)

[so it's like it it's cool and I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m30s)

[absolutely see a potential for multi-reo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m33s)

[stuff So yeah if you're using it check](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m36s)

[it out Like this is this is an area the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m38s)

[um the CLI is an area where it's on the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m42s)

[road map I think Where is it is it not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m46s)

[on here it's a it's an area where there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m49s)

[have been significant investments in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m53s)

[last few releases So yeah definitely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m55s)

[check it out Yeah I have eight repos for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h03m57s)

[my project that are all linked in some](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m00s)

[way Yeah and that's the thing is you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m02s)

[start your unit of work and initially](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m04s)

[what it does is it's watching the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m07s)

[repositories that are in the workspace](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m09s)

[that you select but it doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m11s)

[be tied to a workspace You can kind of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m13s)

[go workspace less and just kind of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m14s)

[arbitrarily add repos into your unit of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m17s)

[work as you go That is an option Um it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m20s)

[just means you have to specify extra](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m23s)

[options on the end of these commands](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m25s)

[that aren't being shown here This thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m26s)

[is set up where the user has already](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m28s)

[effectively said "Hey this is the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m31s)

[workspace I'm working in This is the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m33s)

[stuff I want you to track." So now you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m35s)

[you if you don't do that and you just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m39s)

[you know have arbitrary repos cloned on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m41s)

[your repository you can still leverage](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m43s)

[it It's just you have to add them in one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m44s)

[at a time Think of it doing like get](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m48s)

[commit or or um get add on individual](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m50s)

[files as you go rather than you know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m53s)

[star effectively Um but yeah so this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h04m56s)

[this is definitely an interesting thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m00s)

[to do The other thing that's worth](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m03s)

[noting and this is both a blessing and a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m04s)

[curse is they do pass through to the git](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m07s)

[CLI](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m10s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m12s)

[which is cool but I also found that I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m14s)

[typo things and then I get feedback that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m17s)

[was that was my typo clearly not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m20s)

[matching and being fed into the git CLI](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m22s)

[under the hood So it's it's nice](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m24s)

[I I just don't care that much that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m28s)

[you've saved me one character of typing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m30s)

[from typing git versus gk](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m34s)

[it's an alias but you know it it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m38s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m41s)

[uh let's see I have eight repos for my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m42s)

[project that are all linked in some way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m45s)

[uh that is not including the ones that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m47s)

[build the custom child agent docker](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m48s)

[images](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m50s)

[yeah and that's the thing is it it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m52s)

[very nice to be able to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m54s)

[manage](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m57s)

[in some way uh that whole thing So and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h05m58s)

[yeah workspace friendly If you've got](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m02s)

[your stuff in workspaces already good to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m04s)

[go right off to the races](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m06s)

[Um but yeah the work items that was the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m10s)

[term I I kept calling it unit of work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m14s)

[Sorry I said unit of work Replace](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m16s)

[everywhere I said unit of work with the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m17s)

[word work items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m19s)

[This is what I need AI for is to go back](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m21s)

[and retroactively fix my stream so that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m23s)

[I said the right word That would be a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m26s)

[good use of AI Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m28s)

[yeah And again work item which I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m32s)

[know how much I love that term I feel](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m37s)

[like that that's one of those terms in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m38s)

[software development that think it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m40s)

[overloaded Yes if that's what you're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m41s)

[doing definitely check this out because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m43s)

[it is it is a really cool way to to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m45s)

[it especially if you're already using](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m48s)

[Git Kraken stuff Um and even people](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m51s)

[running on the free tier like several of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m54s)

[these several of the commands in the Git](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m56s)

[Kraken CLI work on uh free tier Git](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h06m59s)

[Kraken Now obviously not everything um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m03s)

[but some things some things absolutely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m06s)

[work like local workspaces work work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m09s)

[just fine on free tier but if you want](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m11s)

[to start syncing well now we're talking](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m13s)

[about needing accounts and that kind of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m15s)

[stuff So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m19s)

[okay uh we were looking for a test that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m21s)

[covered duplicate instances](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m23s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m26s)

[expanded child can replace top level](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m31s)

[child can replace nested child element](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m33s)

[with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m36s)

[remove](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m38s)

[left and right click collapse](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m41s)

[inserts children credit index remove](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m45s)

[children from item with already expanded](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m48s)

[should move child](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h07m52s)

[Selecting multiple items adds them So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m04s)

[these are all So there isn't a test Why](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m07s)

[did I Why did I not add a test for this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m09s)

[why did I not add a test for this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m15s)

[i should have 100% added a test for this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m21s)

[I am an idiot for not adding a test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m28s)

[because we absolutely should have had](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m34s)

[items that did this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m39s)

[And I don't know that we have any](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m48s)

[that don't just blindly use the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m53s)

[let's see treeview data bindings](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h08m59s)

[testable collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m01s)

[Yeah](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m04s)

[because we needed something observable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m10s)

[here And the the key thing here is this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m12s)

[like adding in the same instance is not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m16s)

[as terrible as the fact that record](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m21s)

[classes exist](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m25s)

[because record classes override your](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m31s)

[equality](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m33s)

[And so you get um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m36s)

[value style uh comparisons](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m39s)

[This collection view what does this one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m45s)

[do one of these I could have sworn I had](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m47s)

[done it somewhere to cover it And maybe](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m50s)

[I did it implicitly on one of these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m52s)

[Did I do it in here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h09m58s)

[didn't do it here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m08s)

[This is just using a collection view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m13s)

[mini 4G Welcome](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m25s)

[Oh cool Yeah](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m30s)

[looking forward to it as well Do come up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m34s)

[and say hi I will have Shoot Where did](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m36s)

[they go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m40s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m42s)

[If anyone is interested I do I will be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m53s)

[packing a copious amount](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m56s)

[of Vellopac stickers](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h10m59s)

[I have I think a thousand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m02s)

[maybe more I I I don't know exactly](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m05s)

[because I did an order and it was at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m09s)

[least So I've got something like that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m11s)

[I've given away a bunch already but I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m14s)

[will have stickers if anybody's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m16s)

[interested Yeah please do Mini4G Looking](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m18s)

[forward to it Absolutely looking forward](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m21s)

[to it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m23s)

[Absolutely looking forward to it Why I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m30s)

[am just shocked that I did not that I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m31s)

[did not add any items in here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m35s)

[They're all distinct instances Why did I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m39s)

[not do this it was I dumb](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m42s)

[It's possible I was dumb I I cannot](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m46s)

[eliminate that as an explanation](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m48s)

[What is this thing sw](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m55s)

[does not access instance data and can be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h11m57s)

[made static Oh well thank you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m00s)

[Let's see here Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m03s)

[so this is this is wonderful with the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m07s)

[some of the new analyzers So the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m10s)

[argument here do not guard remove calls](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m12s)

[with contains](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m15s)

[because remove returns a boolean If it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m17s)

[not in there it will just return false](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m19s)

[So doing a contains and then a remove is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m23s)

[just wasteful](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m26s)

[Absolutely just wasteful](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m29s)

[Okay Anything else in here good Good](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m33s)

[Good Good Good Good Okay So that that is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m35s)

[problematic I think what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m39s)

[I want to check in a couple failing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m42s)

[tests and then I will let Corin's run](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m43s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m47s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m49s)

[so let's let's put in a test for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m50s)

[failure case of collapsing and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m53s)

[clicking uh outside tree list view data](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h12m56s)

[binding So we can probably just grab](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m00s)

[this as a starting point](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m02s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m06s)

[and then I just want to do one thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m07s)

[really quick of throw new exception Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m09s)

[foo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m14s)

[foo](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m16s)

[And I just want to make sure Oh Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m20s)

[two for now I just want to make sure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m24s)

[that this thing properly fails the test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m26s)

[because it's always I'm fairly confident](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m29s)

[remote execute on a thrown exception](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m33s)

[will propagate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m35s)

[an exception back which is all that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m37s)

[really matters for the purposes of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m39s)

[test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m41s)

[But I don't know if it'll propagate the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m45s)

[right exception So it did the thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m48s)

[Good good good good good good good good](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m52s)

[good good excellent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m56s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h13m59s)

[System exception food Perfect It even](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m01s)

[propagates the right Okay Okay We are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m03s)

[cooking with fire now Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m06s)

[okay So we can use this as our fallback](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m11s)

[Uh okay So this is going to go through](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m14s)

[add button Get item one Get item two Add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m16s)

[three children to item two Uh left click](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m20s)

[on the expander I don't need to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m24s)

[leftclick on item two itself](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m26s)

[Uh let's see Expand](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m30s)

[Uh let's see Expand the second item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m33s)

[Uh let's see select the second child So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m37s)

[we're going to go uh controll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m42s)

[leftclick I guess we don't even need](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m46s)

[control here because we haven't selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m48s)

[anything yet](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m50s)

[So and then I want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m52s)

[collapse](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m56s)

[let's see collapse the uh parent item So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h14m59s)

[I want to do this guy here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m04s)

[Just going to do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m08s)

[and then I would like to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m12s)

[uh let's see leftclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m15s)

[on item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m20s)

[Uh this should cause the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m23s)

[uh previous selection to clear](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m27s)

[All right So we are going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m32s)

[await item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m35s)

[Uh left click](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m38s)

[Boom And then we'll add in the same](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m41s)

[delay for the animation because it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m44s)

[annoying And then remote execute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m45s)

[Assert selected items We don't need any](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m49s)

[of this I don't believe So the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m51s)

[expectation here is then that selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m54s)

[items should be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h15m58s)

[uh should be one and actually I think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m01s)

[what I want to do is I want to do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m04s)

[and I realize the more xunit I write the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m07s)

[worse I've made my tunit refactor but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m10s)

[you know what darn it so this is one of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m13s)

[the cool things about collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m15s)

[expressions is I have subtly just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m16s)

[changed my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m20s)

[my test from assert because before I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m23s)

[would write code that's like assert](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m26s)

[collection count is one and then now](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m28s)

[that I know there's only one item check](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m31s)

[that the zeroth item is inside of here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m33s)

[Well what I can do instead now is I um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m36s)

[we can go through and say make a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m40s)

[collection and then assert that this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m42s)

[collection matches this collection Now](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m45s)

[this can obviously throw if the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m48s)

[collection's empty because sub-zero no](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m50s)

[longer matches out of range all that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m51s)

[jazz That's fine A throw an exception](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m53s)

[even if it's an out-of- range exception](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m56s)

[isn't an assert failure but it's still a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m57s)

[test failure And so I'm a little less](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h16m59s)

[like sometimes people write their tests](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m02s)

[in ways to try to dodge exceptions](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m04s)

[And I don't know that I care that much](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m07s)

[because an uh a failure to an assert is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m09s)

[just a thrown exception And the only](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m12s)

[difference is what type of exception and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m15s)

[the messaging that goes along with it So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m17s)

[if the messaging isn't significant](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m19s)

[then I don't care Let let the regular](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m22s)

[exception propagate up Same with like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m25s)

[these hard casts If the data context](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m27s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m28s)

[such that this cast would fail I'm not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m30s)

[using an as or a pattern match or any of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m33s)

[that stuff Nah No straight hard cast](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m35s)

[because if this changes I don't mind a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m38s)

[cast exception bubbling up like this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m40s)

[should cause my test to throw an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m42s)

[unhandled exception and crash Okay but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m44s)

[this test now what I expect it to do is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m48s)

[I expect it to have a collection of two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m51s)

[uh inside the selected items And so oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m54s)

[this is actually not quite right cuz](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h17m58s)

[this is only going to val Oh see as I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m01s)

[talk through it I realize I'm an idiot](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m04s)

[because I actually want to do something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m06s)

[more like uh select x value](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m08s)

[So I want to verify that all of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m13s)

[items not just the first one So then if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m16s)

[it's empty this will handle it nicely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m19s)

[Huzzah huzzah huzzah huzzah](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m21s)

[Mini4G are you interested in becoming a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m29s)

[Microsoft MVP or is it just uh meet and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m32s)

[greet is what what you're mostly](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m35s)

[interested in at the conference next](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m37s)

[week](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m39s)

[Oh look at that It's so glorious The](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m41s)

[test failed Oh I love it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m43s)

[Yeah See there we go Exactly the failure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m46s)

[we saw in the UI replicated here Right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m49s)

[The nested item is still in the selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m52s)

[items despite the fact that the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m53s)

[expectation should be one Perfect We](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m55s)

[have written a test to capture the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m57s)

[failure we are aware of Excellent Now uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h18m59s)

[I should change this description and the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m04s)

[test name Uh let's see Collapsing parent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m06s)

[and moving selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m16s)

[leers's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m18s)

[selection from](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m20s)

[uh hidden node I hidden child node](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m24s)

[there and then we don't need the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m29s)

[description on this since I think the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m30s)

[test name covers it Okay now the last](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m32s)

[thing I want to do is I want to see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m35s)

[um yeah so a bit of both to be honest](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m39s)

[I'd love to know more about the path uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m42s)

[what the path to MVP looks like and if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m45s)

[it's something I realistically have the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m46s)

[time to dedicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m51s)

[morning select ion missing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h19m54s)

[so for for you mini 4G um yeah no I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m03s)

[think it'll be perfect so Justin who is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m08s)

[going to be doing the um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m10s)

[Oh thank you Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m15s)

[yes I will I will go through and and fix](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m19s)

[that in just a second JC Uh but for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m21s)

[the MVP stuff Justin who will be doing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m24s)

[the kind of introduction uh to the uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m26s)

[program is going to be kind of outlining](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m29s)

[what the program is kind of some basic](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m31s)

[stuff that uh what it goes to and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m34s)

[there's four of us MVPs that were uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m36s)

[effectively asked to share a bit of our](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m40s)

[story about the MVP program and what uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m42s)

[they left it kind of open-ended but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m47s)

[things around you know what benefits we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m49s)

[see what we do to maintain it that sort](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m51s)

[of thing So yeah Uh and at least a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m53s)

[couple of them I've interacted with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m56s)

[before Really great people So definitely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h20m58s)

[come with questions Um it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m01s)

[trying to think of how to word this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m05s)

[properly The MVP is definitely something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m06s)

[that can occupy a significant amount of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m09s)

[time but it doesn't always have to It's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m12s)

[it's a lot about having uh influence Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m15s)

[and but there's a lot of ways that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m20s)

[people go about doing this and it's it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m22s)

[sometimes hard to describe and I was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m24s)

[really happy that they brought in kind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m26s)

[of a bunch of different MVPs so that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m27s)

[hopefully people kind of get that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m30s)

[picture that there's not just one kind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m32s)

[of clear path forward Um oftentimes it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m34s)

[like oh well I have to be like Kevin or](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m38s)

[you know so and so in order to become an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m40s)

[MVP like well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m42s)

[no I mean you could but there's there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m44s)

[there's lots there's lots of different](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m49s)

[ways that people kind of go about](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m51s)

[getting it And so if it seems like maybe](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m52s)

[you aren't getting a straight answer on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m54s)

[some questions it's because there's kind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m55s)

[of multiple answers So it's like nobody](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h21m58s)

[wants to put anybody in a box and say](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m01s)

["Well you must do X Y and Z." It's like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m02s)

[well you kind of have some choice here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m04s)

[Um but yes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m10s)

[let's see so tree list view collapsing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m12s)

[parent and moving selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m15s)

[Thank you Thank you JC](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m19s)

[I will say you have an eagle eye for uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m23s)

[catching my coding mistakes So I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m25s)

[appreciate that Um okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m27s)

[this guy fails with the appropriate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m30s)

[failure Now the next one I want to cover](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m32s)

[and I don't know whether this one's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m35s)

[expected to pass or fail but I want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m37s)

[make sure that it works Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m39s)

[specifically because the implementation](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m43s)

[gave me pause](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m45s)

[And so uh let's see here I want to go to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m47s)

[tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m51s)

[list view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m52s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h22m58s)

[Okay And I think this guy here we'll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m01s)

[just make private We'll get this off of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m05s)

[there Um and as long as this still](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m07s)

[compiles that should be totally fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m10s)

[Like I'm not overly thrilled The other](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m14s)

[thing that's worth calling out here is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m17s)

[this new keyword Um this is something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m19s)

[that is often to be avoided in C](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m22s)

[uh because it it's kind of like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m27s)

[overwriting a member but not right and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m29s)

[so if uh and I'll explain](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m33s)

[Oh yeah yeah yeah shut up so two right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m37s)

[so the the key difference here is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m41s)

[treelist view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m44s)

[treelist view right if I do treelist](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m46s)

[view dot selected items right if I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m48s)

[controlclick on this I should land right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m53s)

[here right on our property Here's the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h23m57s)

[here's the where here's where it gets](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m00s)

[problematic List view lv gets treelist](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m02s)

[view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m08s)

[right and if I do lv selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m10s)

[right and then I go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m14s)

[I land somewhere different right despite](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m17s)

[the fact that both both of these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m20s)

[variables here this one and this one are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m23s)

[both the exact same instance which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m27s)

[property I invoke is entirely dependent](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m30s)

[upon the type of my member which is not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m33s)

[the same for an override If we were able](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m36s)

[to override this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m38s)

[they would both end up in the same place](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m41s)

[So that the it now in this case I think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m44s)

[it's appropriate because there's no](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m47s)

[other reasonable way to do it because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m49s)

[the base isn't virtual like WPF did not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m51s)

[think about people doing this when they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m55s)

[built this uh two decades ago So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h24m57s)

[a and I think the odds of people getting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m04s)

[into that situation in this case are low](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m06s)

[So it's it's perfectly fine Most of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m10s)

[time you'll see people advocate for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m13s)

[we'll rename it but in this case](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m14s)

[selected items really is the right name](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m16s)

[and what we expect And so overwriting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m19s)

[this sort of situation I I think is the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m23s)

[right way to handle this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m26s)

[Um and and I shouldn't use the word](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m29s)

[override I know I just said it twice and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m31s)

[that was wrong and incorrect Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m33s)

[okay So this example here I need to find](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m37s)

[if I have a good way of giving myself](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m40s)

[an injection point](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m44s)

[I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m53s)

[is I think I want to give myself one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h25m58s)

[more](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m01s)

[button to abuse I think is what I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m03s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m07s)

[I think that's the path of least](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m09s)

[resistance without breaking my world](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m11s)

[And](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m16s)

[cuz all we've done is add in all these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m17s)

[buttons So I think I'm just going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m19s)

[add duplicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m23s)

[and then we'll do add duplicate on click](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m28s)

[and we'll just go implement it That way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m34s)

[I've got it This is one of the areas](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m36s)

[with um ZAML test where it's not always](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m38s)

[trivial to get inside of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m41s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m44s)

[And we could do the remote callback](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m46s)

[situation but that just feels wrong Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m48s)

[let's see add dup](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m51s)

[So what I really want to do is add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m57s)

[duplicate item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h26m59s)

[So what we are going to do is something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m03s)

[a little akin to this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m07s)

[So add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m11s)

[duplicate item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m14s)

[And we're not going to have an else case](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m16s)

[We're just going to do this So if the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m18s)

[selected item because before this was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m21s)

[adding a a child um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m23s)

[there And I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m28s)

[is we're going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m30s)

[Ooh but this this always nests And I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m38s)

[don't think selected item knows its](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m42s)

[parent does it oh it does Oh lovely Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m44s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m49s)

[uh so and then we need to do if selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m51s)

[item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m54s)

[uh is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m56s)

[pattern match it out Look at that Look](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h27m58s)

[at that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m01s)

[Okay so this this is getting me pretty](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m06s)

[close](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m09s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m10s)

[but what I would like to do is I would](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m12s)

[like to add select rather than creating](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m16s)

[a new one here I want to add selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m20s)

[item right back into the tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m22s)

[So there are two instances of selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m27s)

[item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m30s)

[Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m32s)

[that should get me there because I think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m36s)

[given the implementation here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m40s)

[fix this because I think we will push a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m46s)

[we'll push a small change up Oh I wanted](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m49s)

[to check Can I replace this like this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h28m52s)

[oh yeah It's because this ah this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m00s)

[doesn't support generics yet And I say](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m03s)

[yet it may it likely never will Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m06s)

[yeah because it's a non-generic eye](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m15s)

[That's actually a good point We don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m18s)

[need to make this an eyelist](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m20s)

[but we don't know the type So the best](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m24s)

[we would end up doing would be object](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m26s)

[here anyway which isn't really going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m28s)

[buy us anything So eh whatever Okay So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m30s)

[let's go back to the test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m33s)

[now that I've got a way of doing this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m37s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m41s)

[uh add I need to get the duplicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m43s)

[button](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m46s)

[Duplicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m48s)

[And then we will grab item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m50s)

[And then I don't think I want any of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h29m56s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m01s)

[Okay So I want to click on item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m08s)

[uh to select it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m10s)

[Uh add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m16s)

[two duplicate Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m19s)

[we should call this add duplicate All](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m22s)

[right Uh add two duplicates to the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m25s)

[uh tree](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m30s)

[We're going to click click](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m34s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m38s)

[I think what I want to do is actually](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m44s)

[deselect](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m47s)

[This is interesting because this is item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m52s)

[one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m54s)

[I think what I want to do is then grab](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h30m56s)

[the second one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m00s)

[the second duplicate that I added So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m03s)

[after doing that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m10s)

[because let's see there is item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m12s)

[uh don't forget to rename test off to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m16s)

[work Oh thank you JC](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m18s)

[Thank you very much Uh adding](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m20s)

[duplicate items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m25s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m28s)

[and selecting them](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m31s)

[allows for selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m39s)

[work I guess](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m45s)

[No problem Mini4G Uh yeah I will see you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m48s)

[build Looking forward to it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m53s)

[Okay so this is item one We're going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m56s)

[insert at the same index So items two it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h31m59s)

[should be item three](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m03s)

[Uh let's see New item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m05s)

[And I want to do new item Leftclick And](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m09s)

[then I want to assert on the selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m12s)

[Oh but this is going to blow away the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m16s)

[other one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m18s)

[I think what I want to do is I want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m20s)

[do the multi select So let me go up here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m23s)

[and steal a little bit Is I effectively](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m27s)

[want to do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m31s)

[right is I want to do this but I want](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m35s)

[you to live up here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m39s)

[And I don't think](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m42s)

[there So we're going to controlclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m45s)

[I should give myself an API to make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m49s)

[control-click a little easier](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m51s)

[Fact that I have to do this is kind of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m54s)

[annoying but whatever Um okay So I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h32m56s)

[expect this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m00s)

[one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m04s)

[one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m07s)

[from the selected items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m09s)

[Let's run this I think this one fails](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m13s)

[and only shows a single item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m15s)

[but I think two items show up in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m18s)

[selected Well maybe not Maybe not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m22s)

[Maybe not And I will say there there is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m28s)

[technically a workaround for this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m31s)

[Um is you combine the uh selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m35s)

[property of the list item itself](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m38s)

[rather than having something at the top](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m41s)

[level failed to find](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m43s)

[Oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m47s)

[okay So let's do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m50s)

[let's go here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m54s)

[And I want to grab it here And I want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m56s)

[make sure are we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h33m58s)

[patch debugger false](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m02s)

[Let's debug this test The break point](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m09s)

[will cause the unit test process to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m11s)

[pause but we'll leave the WPF process](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m13s)

[running so we can interact with it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m15s)

[Okay so it did add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m21s)

[two duplicates](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m24s)

[and I guess I just want to test here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m27s)

[Yeah see when I click on these it's not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m30s)

[allowing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m32s)

[Oh so the controlclick works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m36s)

[The control-click absolutely works but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m40s)

[single click doesn't So maybe what I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m42s)

[should do is I should actually go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m45s)

[Oh it's it's very interesting because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m50s)

[the item will show](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m53s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m56s)

[Oh it's interesting that if I go down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h34m59s)

[and then up it's fine But if I click](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m00s)

[here it wants that one If I go here and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m02s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m05s)

[Oh is it because No that doesn't make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m13s)

[sense because all of these are the same](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m16s)

[All of these ones are the same instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m19s)

[So why is it failing to find sub3](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m23s)

[0 one two three](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m29s)

[There should be three in there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m32s)

[Is it just that I that it executed too](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m34s)

[quickly and it didn't find them](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m37s)

[nope Get out of my way for a second I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m40s)

[just want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m42s)

[uh Yeah that should work I wonder if it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m46s)

[just executed too quickly and failed to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m48s)

[find them So if I step here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h35m50s)

[yeah I'm going to go with just executed](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m03s)

[too quickly and we just needed to give](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m04s)

[it time](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m08s)

[Um okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m10s)

[So the control clicking should work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m17s)

[I am curious what does it show for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m21s)

[selected items in this case](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m24s)

[Right So if I go up to my](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m27s)

[tree list view and look at selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m31s)

[items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m33s)

[and go data context](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m40s)

[let's just go here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m45s)

[count one right and I think that's so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m47s)

[that's one problem is that count one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m51s)

[fails to work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m54s)

[Is this solvable is the question](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h36m59s)

[Is this solvable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m07s)

[because if virtualization is turned on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m14s)

[if virtualization is turned on there is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m22s)

[no good way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m24s)

[There's no good way to know right i](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m31s)

[don't I don't think this contains is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m33s)

[correct I think this contains needs to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m35s)

[be removed Maybe we'll just drop that to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m36s)

[begin with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m40s)

[because that's more in line with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m43s)

[um same with here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m46s)

[But if the same instance or the same](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m52s)

[item that is equal to another item and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h37m56s)

[we're using instance equality right now](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m00s)

[because that's the common case but it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m02s)

[could be a record class that has value](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m04s)

[based equality So it could be two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m06s)

[separate instances with the same values](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m08s)

[If two items are equal](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m11s)

[one was selected and you scrolled far](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m15s)

[enough that the UI item was removed and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m18s)

[then you went back](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m21s)

[How would you know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m24s)

[which one was selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m28s)

[how would you know which one was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m37s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m39s)

[i don't know that you would be able to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m46s)

[tell the difference You would have to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m49s)

[know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m51s)

[the selection path](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h38m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m05s)

[you would have to know the selection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m08s)

[path](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m10s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m24s)

[I should probably leave a comment on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m26s)

[this once we push it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m27s)

[I'm just trying to think if there if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m36s)

[there is a way to do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m37s)

[We have the concept of getting the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m43s)

[parent object](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m45s)

[um get expanded](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m50s)

[Clean some of this up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m53s)

[Get container from item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h39m58s)

[I don't know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m06s)

[that it is reasonable to expect that we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m09s)

[could reselect these but I think without](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m11s)

[those contains I will get a much more](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m15s)

[consistent behavior So let's test that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m17s)

[theory](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m20s)

[Let us test that theory because if I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m22s)

[debug this again I should be able to see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m25s)

[both of the duplicate items in there and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m30s)

[I should be able to click around and see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m33s)

[the selection work because the failure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m35s)

[case is with virtualization and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m38s)

[scrolling off](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m41s)

[right like that is if I click here here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m43s)

[That's bizarre that that behaves that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h40m59s)

[way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m02s)

[Why would it do that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m05s)

[why would it do that so I think it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m12s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m15s)

[Nope](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m20s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m22s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m24s)

[I'm pressing the up and down arrow keys](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m40s)

[Up up up up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m43s)

[Yeah there's something there's something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m48s)

[funky](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m50s)

[around this Um let's try it without the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h41m52s)

[Let's try it before we click the add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m01s)

[dupe because I think it works fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m03s)

[Yeah So the up down arrow keys work So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m17s)

[this thing just straight up fails](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m20s)

[This thing really does not work well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m32s)

[with the duplicate items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m37s)

[Um I am tempted](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m44s)

[to turn off the selection stuff](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m48s)

[and see if that makes a difference](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m52s)

[Uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h42m56s)

[This thing still has](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m01s)

[Right And then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m04s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m07s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m09s)

[That should effectively kill it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m13s)

[I want to see what I want to see what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m18s)

[the behavior is without those changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m20s)

[But specifically I want to see it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m24s)

[without those changes but with my adding](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m25s)

[duplicate node button](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m28s)

[because I don't know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m34s)

[I think if you care about duplicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m36s)

[instances you will have to bind is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m38s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m41s)

[on the individual item because I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m43s)

[think there is another way around it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m46s)

[which](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m53s)

[yeah I just don't know if that works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h43m58s)

[Okay So now we go back to here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m01s)

[Yeah So the arrow keys work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m09s)

[just fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m12s)

[Okay So I think let's let's add a test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m16s)

[for those](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m22s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m24s)

[uh let's see list view adding duplicate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m31s)

[items](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m35s)

[uh and selecting uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m40s)

[with arrow keys](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m43s)

[selects](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m47s)

[uh each item in turn Right all right So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m49s)

[we're going to do this same setup but I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m53s)

[think what we're going to do here is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m56s)

[uh let's see We're going to grab](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h44m59s)

[this is item one We're going to grab](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m03s)

[item zero](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m08s)

[And then I think what I want to do down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m10s)

[here I want to go item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m12s)

[uh zero dot](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m16s)

[leftclick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m19s)

[And actually maybe I don't even need to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m20s)

[do that But we can come down here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m22s)

[actually and just do a for loop For int](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m24s)

[i=0](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m27s)

[i less than 5 i ++ Now in general loops](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m29s)

[are things to be avoided in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m33s)

[tests However](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m37s)

[in this particular case this is a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m40s)

[hard-coded condition and so I know how](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m43s)

[many times it's going to iterate So I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m44s)

[don't really feel as bad about it when](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m47s)

[there's there's a fixed condition like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m50s)

[that Um let's see Item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m52s)

[uh let's see here Actually we want to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h45m58s)

[item zero](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m01s)

[leftclick first](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m03s)

[and then we want to basically check item](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m06s)

[and then arrow down five times](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m10s)

[Right so we want to send keyboard down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m13s)

[Select the next item And then here we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m19s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m22s)

[Oh this is interesting because I can't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m28s)

[It's going to be slightly Okay it's not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m30s)

[It's not worth doing it in a loop right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m31s)

[so we're going to send keyboard down and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m34s)

[then we are going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m36s)

[uh let's see assert selected items But I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m39s)

[want to pass in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m42s)

[uh expected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m45s)

[right so I'm going to pass in expected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m48s)

[here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m51s)

[Oh but I can't pass in expected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m54s)

[Oh this is so dumb The reason I can't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h46m58s)

[pass in expected is remote execute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m01s)

[doesn't allow for capturing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m03s)

[of values](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m07s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m10s)

[Oh wait a minute Wait a minute Yes it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m16s)

[does Yes it does](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m18s)

[Should be that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m28s)

[Um but it is going to be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m33s)

[is going to be losing its mind because](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m36s)

[it will not know the generic parameter](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m38s)

[So I'm going to have to tell it string](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m40s)

[array](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m42s)

[and then it'll figure it out](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m44s)

[Um but given that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m47s)

[is that the right order](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m51s)

[i think it is actually expected that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m54s)

[this goes like this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h47m57s)

[and then my remote execute figures out](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m02s)

[the order of operations](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m05s)

[Just want to make sure I'm hitting the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m08s)

[right overload](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m10s)

[remote execute I realize there's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m13s)

[delegate parameter](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m15s)

[but I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m17s)

[view list view remote execute there's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m24s)

[overloads that are extension methods](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m26s)

[So this is action tree list view t1](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m32s)

[Oh so I need this to be pre-list view](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m40s)

[like that And now this should h it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m48s)

[should go to the right place Yeah that's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m51s)

[what I'm looking for That is what I'm](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m54s)

[looking for Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m56s)

[And it should be able to serialize a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h48m59s)

[string array because it's just JSON](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m01s)

[serialization Okay So we're going to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m02s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m05s)

[We are going to first assert that we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m07s)

[have item zero](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m09s)

[and then down Then we're going to assert](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m11s)

[item one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m15s)

[Then we are going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m18s)

[effectively replicate this a couple](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m20s)

[times](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m23s)

[Uh let's do for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m25s)

[i uh int](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m27s)

[uh i equals z](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m30s)

[uh i less than](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m34s)

[0 one two is three times Okay](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m36s)

[Down assert down assert And then we're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m39s)

[going to do one last time which expects](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m42s)

[a two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m44s)

[Right And this is the behavior we expect](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m46s)

[And then we get rid of all this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m50s)

[there So let's make sure this test I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m54s)

[believe passes until we go and reenable](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m56s)

[the code inside of the custom control](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h49m59s)

[Then I think we will flip and go back](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m04s)

[That went in the wrong order didn't it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m07s)

[did it did it did](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m16s)

[it do that oh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m22s)

[uh system is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m25s)

[object of type string cannot be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m27s)

[converted to type system string](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m30s)

[what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m35s)

[I the only one that doesn't see the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m43s)

[string](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m44s)

[binder info remote execute object params](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m53s)

[Wait a minute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h50m58s)

[This should be going to here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m04s)

[Oh is there a bug in this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m08s)

[no because it should wrap this up and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m14s)

[wrap it up in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m16s)

[these are all the T result ones](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m21s)

[So funk funk funk funk funk Here's the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m25s)

[action ones](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m28s)

[We expect that we are in action T1 T2](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m30s)

[Remote execute new object](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m45s)

[param one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m48s)

[That makes sense That goes into the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h51m59s)

[remote execute there Interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m01s)

[interesting interesting interesting Have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m07s)

[I shot myself in the foot here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m09s)

[so let's debug the test really quick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m15s)

[I just want to check it So that is in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m23s)

[the state we expect If we do remote](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m26s)

[execute](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m29s)

[it throws and dies](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m33s)

[visual tree service So it makes it all](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m38s)

[the way there](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m40s)

[Oh did it serialize it as a string oh it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m45s)

[serialized it as a string](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m48s)

[Oh that I'm so bad I'm so bad I'm so bad](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m52s)

[Okay here's what we're going to do We're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m55s)

[going to do this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h52m58s)

[We're going to make it of type string](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m00s)

[Make it because I'm only passing a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m03s)

[single item So it doesn't matter for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m05s)

[this We can do this We can do this We](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m07s)

[can just make it a string We can make it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m11s)

[a string And then down here we can just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m14s)

[do the collection expression like that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m17s)

[Run test](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m22s)

[This should just work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m24s)

[And then I'm going to switch back and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m28s)

[we'll talk brain teasery bits](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m29s)

[Why did that selection appear to go back](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m33s)

[to the top](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m35s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m43s)

[Collections differ Okay that's what we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m52s)

[expect is an assert failure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m55s)

[So we expected zero got nothing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h53m58s)

[like that list iterator empty collection](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m08s)

[no match](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m11s)

[Um this has all of the stuff turned off](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m13s)

[though so it may](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m16s)

[may not work properly](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m19s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m24s)

[Aha So now with those appropriately](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m29s)

[defined this now works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m32s)

[Okay But I think the key thing here is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m38s)

[adding in the duplicate items should](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m42s)

[still work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m45s)

[I'll have to think about how this one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m50s)

[should work I think I'm going to push up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h54m52s)

[Discard](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m30s)

[Okay And then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m32s)

[collapse](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m35s)

[of the bar Okay So we we want this We](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m37s)

[want this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m40s)

[We want this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m43s)

[Um I do not want this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m46s)

[That's fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m50s)

[New tests are fine](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h55m52s)

[Brain teaser time Brain teaser time So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m38s)

[for those people who weren't here at the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m41s)

[beginning](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m43s)

[I will share](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m44s)

[a link This is a net fiddle](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m46s)

[This was unfortunately something from a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m50s)

[colleague](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m53s)

[and the question was simple What the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h56m57s)

[heck or I'm paraphrasing but basically](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m00s)

[that So here here's the premise](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m03s)

[We have we've got a class right class](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m07s)

[with event it has an event it has a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m11s)

[helper property that just checks if the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m15s)

[event is null So in C events are what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m18s)

[are called multiccast delegates](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m21s)

[effectively a list of uh methods what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m23s)

[you can think of them as And when you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m26s)

[have not registered anything for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m29s)

[event it goes to null When you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m30s)

[unregister the last handler it goes to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m33s)

[null when there is at least one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m35s)

[registration it is not null That is what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m37s)

[this is checking Okay So that is our](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m40s)

[that is our class with event We have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m43s)

[this event register class which we'll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m45s)

[look at in just a second and we create](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m47s)

[two of our class with event instances](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m49s)

[And then we go to our event register](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m52s)

[class and call update one on first](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m53s)

[We then do some quick checking on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m57s)

[whether first uh uh first event is null](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h57m59s)

[and second event is null we call update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m02s)

[one a second time and then redo the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m04s)

[checks Okay keep that in mind Let's go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m07s)

[look at what the update one method does](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m10s)

[So the update one method comes in and I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m12s)

[will point out this m= 3 real quick](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m16s)

[local variable But then here we check if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m20s)

[there is an existing uh instance and if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m23s)

[so we're going to unregister the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m26s)

[with the minus equals right here Right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m29s)

[we then register up a new handler for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m32s)

[the event and then we cache our last](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m36s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m38s)

[Throws it right up here in this field](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m40s)

[Right so this is what update one does](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m42s)

[And remember we call this twice Once](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m44s)

[with the first instance and once with](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m46s)

[the second instance This kind of pattern](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m48s)

[here is usually done so that you only](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m51s)

[get a single registration for the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m54s)

[In this case it's kind of popping](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m56s)

[between two instances which is uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h58m58s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m01s)

[but it's it's nothing overly fancy](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m03s)

[However I will point out down here right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m05s)

[so these first two are the first](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m09s)

[invocation](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m13s)

[of update one And at the end of that we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m14s)

[see that first is null is false which is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m18s)

[kind of a a double negative but it means](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m21s)

[that first has an event registration](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m23s)

[Great Second is null which means it does](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m26s)

[not have an event registration That is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m28s)

[as expected However what is unexpected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m30s)

[here is that on the second call both](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m33s)

[first and second have an event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m38s)

[registration Meaning this guy here did](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m41s)

[not appropriately unregister the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m45s)

[from the first instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m49s)

[Okay did not appropriately unregister](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m52s)

[because both of these things are false](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m54s)

[We go back up here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=01h59m57s)

[We we go into we go into round two of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m00s)

[this right so we're going to look at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m03s)

[this section So we get brand new](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m04s)

[instances on both of these guys right so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m06s)

[everything's brand new clean slate We're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m09s)

[off to the races We're going to call](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m11s)

[register class We're going to do update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m14s)

[two passing in first Same kind of output](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m16s)

[Update to a with the second instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m19s)

[Same kind of output Same thing that we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m21s)

[did only changes a call to update two](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m24s)

[instead of update one Okay let's go down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m26s)

[and look at what update two does Update](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m28s)

[two is almost identical to update one](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m31s)

[You will note once again we check if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m34s)

[there is a previous or last instance and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m37s)

[if so we're going to unregister We're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m40s)

[going to register up on the Oh that was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m42s)

[horrible We're going to register up on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m44s)

[the new instance right then we're going](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m46s)

[to cache the previous instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m49s)

[But the key difference is down here You](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m52s)

[will note](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m56s)

[this actually did what we expected](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h00m58s)

[right so in this case after the first](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m01s)

[invocation first has a registration but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m04s)

[second is null And then on the second](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m08s)

[pass first is first registration has](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m11s)

[gone back to null So it has properly](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m14s)

[unregistered](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m17s)

[and second is now the one with the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m19s)

[registration on it So this one worked](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m22s)

[properly but the other one didn't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m25s)

[So I showed this earlier on in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m29s)

[stream So if anybody wants to avoid](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m31s)

[spoilers you've got about five seconds](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m34s)

[to pause or mute me before I start](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m36s)

[giving away spoilers Right So the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m39s)

[fiddle's in the chat if you want to mess](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m43s)

[around with it Uh the only difference is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m45s)

[the m= 3 That is 100% correct Izzy](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m48s)

[There's technically an inconsequential](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m52s)

[difference where this local function and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m54s)

[I shouldn't say inconsequential](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h01m57s)

[um but I will point it out So the m= 3](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m00s)

[right here m is used in the console](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m03s)

[right line inside of the local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m06s)

[that is relevant down here Rather than](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m09s)

[uh there being a local variable this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m13s)

[console right line just writes out the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m16s)

[string m](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m18s)

[which is obviously different One's going](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m20s)

[to show you an int the other is going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m22s)

[just show you the string m But yes that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m25s)

[is the only consequential difference](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m27s)

[And this is one of those cases where I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m31s)

[I'm confident my colleague probably](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m33s)

[backed into this by accident and then](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m35s)

[got very confused as to the behavior Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m38s)

[uh closure versus no closure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m42s)

[Yes Bananatron Bananatron is on point](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m46s)

[Absolutely on point Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m50s)

[That is that is correct the magical](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m55s)

[keyword to put into the Googles is going](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m57s)

[to be closure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h02m59s)

[Right so if we take this and go one step](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m01s)

[further with it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m05s)

[Uh hang on I've got a I've got a link](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m07s)

[made a link](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m10s)

[Okay So if we go and look at Sharp Labs](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m12s)

[So Sharp Labs oftentimes people will use](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m15s)

[it to look at the IL Um but I'm not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m17s)

[going to make you look at that If you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m20s)

[take Sharp Labs and you set it to C up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m22s)

[here in the results one dark theme](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m25s)

[versus light theme Just saying Um but](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m28s)

[what it will show you is the uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m31s)

[decompiled C# Yeah lowered C# for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m35s)

[win Banana you are hitting all of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m37s)

[marks Um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m39s)

[so this is the C sharp as it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m42s)

[decompiled from the IL The key part here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m45s)

[is it shows that lowering it It](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m48s)

[effectively shows you what the C would](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m51s)

[potentially look like without any of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m54s)

[compiler optimizations plugged in Right](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h03m57s)

[so we can see the class with event has a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m01s)

[whole bunch of stuff in here Right most](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m03s)

[people think of writing events just very](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m05s)

[simply like this Right it's it's just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m08s)

[very simple Whereas secretly events are](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m11s)

[like properties where you've got your](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m14s)

[get sets It's just that events have add](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m16s)

[remove and very rarely do people](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m18s)

[actually do anything custom in the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m21s)

[implementations It's almost always just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m23s)

[the shorthand stuff This is something](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m26s)

[we've had since C# two or one Might have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m27s)

[to check one of those very early on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m31s)

[right so all kinds of and you can see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m34s)

[these are compiler generated attributes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m36s)

[The compiler's done some some awesome](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m38s)

[optimizations for us where we don't have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m40s)

[to think great huzzah right that that's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m42s)

[what we're looking for Now the key comes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m45s)

[down here the event register class So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m48s)

[here's where we're going to see the the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m52s)

[the difference between update one and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m53s)

[update two And I'm going to look at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m55s)

[update 2 first So one of the key things](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m56s)

[to know about with delegates in C and uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h04m59s)

[delegates](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m06s)

[have uh the concept of a method info Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m07s)

[and is is it called owner](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m13s)

[i'm uh I'm gonna I'm going to get this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m16s)

[right I I want I want the actual](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m19s)

[delegate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m22s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m25s)

[this is not the thing that I'm looking](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m27s)

[for Source and I I may just I just I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m30s)

[want the literal delegate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m34s)

[class here Uh yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m39s)

[Target that's that's the guy that we're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m45s)

[looking for target and method info](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m47s)

[because that is functionally what makes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m50s)

[up uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m52s)

[a a delegate It's I need to invoke this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m56s)

[method info on this given target](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h05m59s)

[instance Right that's that is relevant](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m01s)

[Let's see Uh Banatron I believe another](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m04s)

[way to think of lowered code is removing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m06s)

[all the syntactic sugar newer language](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m08s)

[feature versions have given us Yes Yes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m10s)

[And I think this is one of the areas](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m13s)

[where](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m15s)

[C gets simpler as new versions come out](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m17s)

[But without this knowledge of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m22s)

[what's happening under the hood you kind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m25s)

[of lose a little bit of that Um and and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m27s)

[I'm going to plug this one more time uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m32s)

[because I can So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m34s)

[that history I think is very important](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m37s)

[to kind of understand And obviously I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m40s)

[don't have time to go into all the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m42s)

[nitty-gritty details but it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m44s)

[absolutely going to be a a key theme](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m46s)

[going through this talk of kind of all](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m50s)

[of the C features moving along because I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m52s)

[think understanding the latest features](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m55s)

[sometimes requires understanding how we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h06m58s)

[got there in order to kind of see that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m00s)

[behavior But yes I like that description](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m02s)

[Okay So on update two when we created](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m06s)

[delegate um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m10s)

[as snug](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m13s)

[uh I I so quick side story I was a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m16s)

[member of the LinkedIn.net user group](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m19s)

[still am for a very long period of time](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m21s)

[and everybody always called it lid nug I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m23s)

[never really considered snug as the way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m25s)

[to do this but darn it I think now that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m28s)

[is going to be stuck in my head Um could](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m31s)

[one say it's the C v1 backwards](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m35s)

[compatibility for latest features that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m38s)

[are just syntactic sugar](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m43s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m46s)

[kind of like there are some this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m47s)

[where it gets hard because some changes](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m50s)

[are compiler some changes are syntactic](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m52s)

[sugar some changes require runtime](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m54s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m56s)

[So kind of maybe some cases Uh but for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h07m59s)

[update 2 the key thing here is it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m04s)

[creating this new action which is a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m06s)

[delegate And so when we see a delegate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m09s)

[the most important thing is to look at](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m12s)

[okay what is what is the method info and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m13s)

[what is the target and in this case the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m16s)

[method info that's being fed into it is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m19s)

[this compiler generated internal static](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m22s)

[So it has taken our local function I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m26s)

[realize my big head I'm trying to keep](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m29s)

[it out of the way This local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m31s)

[here has been turned into this little](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m33s)

[guy over here And you'll note it's just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m35s)

[a static function but it's compiler](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m39s)

[generated So the compiler enforces that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m41s)

[this local function isn't called outside](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m43s)

[of the function that declared it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m46s)

[But you'll also note that this guy here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m49s)

[doesn't doesn't have a target like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m52s)

[there's no there's no instance for this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m54s)

[thing to be invoked on because this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m57s)

[just a static void function Okay And so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h08m59s)

[you'll know the plus equals and the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m02s)

[minus equals we're all good Now if we go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m04s)

[to update one this is where the closure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m07s)

[happens because because this function up](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m10s)

[here right this guy here has console](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m14s)

[right line m right this little local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m18s)

[variable because it's referenced down](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m22s)

[here In order for this function to be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m24s)

[able to know what the value of m is it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m27s)

[has to be able to close over that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m31s)

[variable or to think of it another way](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m33s)

[capture that variable so that it has](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m36s)

[access to it at the point it needs to go](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m38s)

[invoke this So to do that the compiler](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m41s)

[ends up creating this private little](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m43s)

[class and inside of it is m right if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m46s)

[this local function used multiple](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m50s)

[variables we'd see multiple things in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m52s)

[here because it has to close over all of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m54s)

[them Then when we invoke update one we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h09m57s)

[can see it just news up a new instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m00s)

[of this private class It sets the m](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m02s)

[field on it to say hey by the way m is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m05s)

[three](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m08s)

[And now when it goes through to do the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m10s)

[invocation what it ends up doing is it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m12s)

[pointed to this function which is not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m15s)

[static So the we've got a method info](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m18s)

[and now a target instance that we're](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m22s)

[going to go against inside of this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m24s)

[action The key part here is this](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m26s)

[instance The only thing holding on to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m29s)

[this little private classes instance is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m31s)

[this event right because the instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m34s)

[goes into this delegate gets registered](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m37s)

[here and when we leave this method the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m40s)

[only thing holding on to a reference to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m43s)

[this class is this delegate and the only](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m46s)

[thing holding on to this action delegate](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m49s)

[is this event This is often where people](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m52s)

[get bit with uh events in C# causing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m55s)

[memory leaks because they don't realize](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h10m58s)

[that when they register for an event it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m00s)

[has to create an instance of the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m03s)

[delegate that matches the event](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m05s)

[signature](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m07s)

[and that delegate may capture the target](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m09s)

[instance where the method is declared So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m14s)

[if it's an instance method it's going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m16s)

[capture the target of it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m18s)

[so that it can actually invoke on that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m21s)

[instance But that means your event is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m23s)

[now holding on to a reference of another](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m25s)

[thing because it needs that instance in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m28s)

[order to invoke an instance method on it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m31s)

[when that event is raised Whereas if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m34s)

[that target method is static there is no](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m37s)

[instance There is no reason to do any of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m39s)

[the capturing everything just works](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m42s)

[right so the other thing that I will](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m45s)

[point out down here is if you put the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m47s)

[word static on this and this is one of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m50s)

[the things that bothers me the most](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m52s)

[right if you put static on a local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m54s)

[function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m57s)

[this doesn't actually](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h11m59s)

[make the method static It's it's it's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m02s)

[going to but it's it's not quite the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m04s)

[same The key thing here is this method](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m06s)

[is now going to be um is now going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m10s)

[deny you the ability to to accidentally](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m13s)

[close over other variables And that's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m17s)

[the key thing like because it doesn't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m19s)

[close over variables then it gets](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m21s)

[generated as static But it's it's a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m22s)

[little bit different than when when we](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m26s)

[just declare a static method right so](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m28s)

[often times if you are able to it is a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m31s)

[good idea to consider declaring methods](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m35s)

[as static There's nice little an](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m37s)

[emphasis on minor performance bumps that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m40s)

[you can pick up by having a method be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m42s)

[static rather than instance which is why](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m44s)

[you'll see the uh Roslin analyzers flag](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m46s)

[a method It's like hey you aren't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m50s)

[touching any instance members If you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m51s)

[declare this as static you'll get a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m53s)

[small bonus Do you want to do that sure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m54s)

[why not right unless you've got](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m57s)

[something that maybe is reflecting or](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h12m59s)

[otherwise it's a great little great](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m00s)

[little thing right but with local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m02s)

[functions what it does or I should say](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m05s)

[one of its primary purposes is to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m08s)

[prevent accidental closure over](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m10s)

[variables right and local functions](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m12s)

[closing over variables isn't actually a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m15s)

[problem like this gets you this type of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m19s)

[pattern of leveraging local variable or](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m21s)

[yeah local variables inside of a local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m24s)

[function is quite common I've seen](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m26s)

[people do this when they're like I don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m29s)

[want to write a private like I'm going](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m31s)

[to write a local function because I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m32s)

[don't want to write a private function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m34s)

[and pass in four variables I've got them](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m35s)

[all right there in context I'm just](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m38s)

[going to write a little local function](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m39s)

[that I can invoke whenever I need it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m41s)

[inside of this other method Fine great](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m42s)

[But it's important to understand how it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m45s)

[works because that implementation of how](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m47s)

[it's working and closing over that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m50s)

[variable subtly starts to matter when](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m52s)

[you start doing event registrations to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m55s)

[external instances being passed in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h13m58s)

[because this thing is mutating a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m00s)

[passedin parameter and sending out a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m02s)

[reference to a private uh uh instance](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m05s)

[that you may not have expected it to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m09s)

[Izzy have a good one Always good to have](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m12s)

[you around uh no stream next week So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m14s)

[it'll be two weeks out](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m16s)

[So that is that is the full solution I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m20s)

[don't know if my colleagues on and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m24s)

[paying attention but if not you'll be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m26s)

[getting snippets of this later but that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m28s)

[is that is the full explanation of what](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m31s)

[is going on So magical keyword uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m33s)

[closure is I think the the the one that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m36s)

[will land you on the most useful](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m39s)

[information Ah good Victor did the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m41s)

[explanation make sense did I miss](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m43s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m46s)

[is Is there more that needs to happen](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m50s)

[because one of the questions that got](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m54s)

[raised was "Oh well should I always](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m55s)

[declare my local functions as static?"](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m57s)

[It's like well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h14m58s)

[no because sometimes they're really](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m00s)

[useful to have non-static local](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m02s)

[functions that close over variables like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m05s)

[they can often clean up your code and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m08s)

[make it easier to read and all that kind](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m09s)

[of stuff but it's it's just important to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m11s)

[note how they are working](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m13s)

[Yeah as always much deeper than](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m19s)

[requested Well you know what you can't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m21s)

[put interesting code in front of me and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m23s)

[not expect me to do that If you don't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m25s)

[want me to do that don't give me](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m27s)

[interesting code I love interesting code](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m29s)

[So th this type of thing is a really](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m33s)

[awesome example I I thought it was](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m36s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m38s)

[So you came up with a a very good brain](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m40s)

[teaser and you did stump several people](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m42s)

[that I threw out that I threw this in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m44s)

[front of So it was fun watching people's](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m46s)

[head hurt for a little bit when they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m49s)

[stared at it and went "Wait what?" But](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m51s)

[yeah so yes closure is the magical thing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m53s)

[to do And the the other big detail that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h15m57s)

[I would point out is that plus equals on](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m00s)

[an event is effectively calling new](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m03s)

[instance of a delegate Right that I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m07s)

[think is the other really key thing is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m10s)

[plus equals will always translate into](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m13s)

[new delegate instance Right it may not](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m17s)

[always be action It depends on whatever](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m20s)

[whatever your delegate type is up here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m22s)

[right it could be event handler could be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m25s)

[insert type here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m28s)

[right but that is that is the key bit of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m30s)

[kind of what is what is going on and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m35s)

[expected in here](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m37s)

[So plus equals will always create a new](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m40s)

[action Minus equals will remove the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m43s)

[action if this matches](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m47s)

[Right the the key part is for the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m51s)

[delegate to match the target and the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m53s)

[method info have to match And so if you](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m55s)

[if you do something like this right the](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h16m58s)

[the this action is this new action is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m03s)

[not the same as this action because they](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m07s)

[have different target instances](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m09s)

[right because this new it guarantees](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m13s)

[that each call to update one is going to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m15s)

[have a new closure functionally Like](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m18s)

[that's one way to look at this is and I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m20s)

[want now that I say that I do wonder if](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m23s)

[that's the reason the compiler names it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m25s)

[C double underscore is I wonder if the C](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m27s)

[is for closure](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m29s)

[That would be cool I don't know if that](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m32s)

[is I just know the compiler likes to do](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m33s)

[this kind of garbage because this is](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m36s)

[invalid C but not invalid IIL So it's a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m38s)

[it's a nice way for the compiler to make](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m42s)

[a really good assumption on what won't](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m44s)

[conflict with any of your um private](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m45s)

[classes or members](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m48s)

[But I do wonder if it's that way or](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m51s)

[maybe it's just C for class](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m52s)

[Who knows](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m55s)

[um but this does give because this is a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h17m57s)

[new instance the target of each of these](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m00s)

[actions is a different instance which of](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m03s)

[course those don't match](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m05s)

[And then off to the races](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m08s)

[I did just realize these have pipes in](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m11s)

[the name I never noticed that before](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m13s)

[I'm going to remember that for next time](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m18s)

[I'm mcking around in IIL that I can use](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m20s)

[pipes in my method names Not good](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m22s)

[information for me to know Absolutely](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m25s)

[not good information for me to know](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m27s)

[Okay Well I think I am going to crash a](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m29s)

[little early I got to be up early and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m33s)

[get a bunch of documentation written So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m35s)

[that's going to be very very exciting](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m38s)

[Not really but it needs to get done Uh](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m40s)

[and it needs to get done because next](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m43s)

[week I will be at Build Conference So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m45s)

[once again if you haven't signed up for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m47s)

[the build conference highly recommend it](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m48s)

[Uh signing up at least gives you access](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m51s)

[to all of the virtual sessions and](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m53s)

[recordings and whatnot And it's free So](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m55s)

[if you haven't done it I recommend doing](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m58s)

[so It will be a lot of very good useful](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h18m59s)

[information Anyone in person I will be](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m02s)

[there I will be speaking at the Well](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m05s)

[here I do I still have it up I don't I](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m08s)

[will be speaking at the So You want to](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m11s)

[be an MVP session the session planner](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m13s)

[You can search and find it You'll even](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m15s)

[find my picture there now Yay Uh along](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m16s)

[with a few other MVPs So it'll be it'll](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m20s)

[be a great time Um so after that stream](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m24s)

[again in two weeks that I'll tell](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m28s)

[everybody happy coding Thank you for](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m31s)

[coming and hanging out We'll see](https://youtu.be/IrqyH0zfVnM?t=02h19m33s)
