[somewhat related somewhat completely](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m04s)

[brand new and different uh net templates](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m06s)

[uh this is something that I've shown off](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m09s)

[a little bit before specifically my net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m11s)

[templates repo especially as a way when](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m13s)

[people ask questions about how should I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m16s)

[get started what should I do I point](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m17s)

[them there and say hey here's the way I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m19s)

[like to start building my apps I built](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m21s)

[these templates largely for myself but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m23s)

[occasionally other people find them](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m26s)

[useful as well and I find that they are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m27s)

[kind of nice to have a large kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m30s)

[opinionated Suite of template stuff but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m32s)

[they need some work they need some love](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m35s)

[make some new ones we'll talk about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m37s)

[templates we'll probably do some WPF in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m38s)

[there to as well because I think we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m40s)

[going to end up trying to figure out the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m42s)

[appropriate demo application to put](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m44s)

[together but first something exciting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h00m46s)

[good Christmas squirrel uh okay net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h01m59s)

[templates so uh let's talk a little bit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m02s)

[about what net templates are so uh the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m06s)

[net new command and and I've got some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m09s)

[some links on here they go through and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m12s)

[they show all of this stuff but with the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m14s)

[the net new allows you to create your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m17s)

[own templates you aren't just limited to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m19s)

[what uh is in the box so let's do this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m21s)

[real quick CD temp what do I have in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m24s)

[here uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m30s)

[make we're going to just do we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m31s)

[to do this okay there okay empty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m33s)

[directory now if we do something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m37s)

[net new see it it already knows that I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m39s)

[want to use my template no thank you so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m41s)

[we can come in here and we can do what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m45s)

[what did it squawk at me for I used a oh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m47s)

[don't use hyphen hyphen list my mistake](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m50s)

[my mistake list is a subcommand boom](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m52s)

[okay so uh if you do net new list uh you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m55s)

[can get a list of all of your installed](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h02m59s)

[templates and you can see in a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m02s)

[cases many of these are coming from](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m03s)

[built-in components uh the stream IDE](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m06s)

[did a while back with cols one of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m09s)

[opening steps is install the template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m10s)

[for that so that one's in there a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m12s)

[these are going to be coming from](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m14s)

[various workloads that I've installed](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m16s)

[via visual](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m18s)

[studio um and then there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m19s)

[them in here oh I don't even have my own](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m22s)

[installed that's disappointing we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m24s)

[going to fix that here in a moment um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m25s)

[but there's like some from X unit that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m28s)

[you can pick up from various places and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m30s)

[then there's a handful of WPF ones so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m31s)

[when you on net new WPF what you are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m33s)

[doing is you're actually invoking this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m36s)

[WPF application and there's a couple of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m38s)

[them here great huzzah um the problem I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m40s)

[have with a lot of these templates is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m43s)

[they're very simplistic they they're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m44s)

[there you get a good project you're off](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m48s)

[the races but they are not what I would](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m49s)

[consider a complete application uh so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m51s)

[for example if we take](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m54s)

[mine uh let's see let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h03m56s)

[do I kind of want to run the local one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m01s)

[so before we get too carried away let me](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m03s)

[get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m06s)

[my uh this guy open um I because I I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m08s)

[left directions in my read me about if](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m12s)

[people want to run locally what it ends](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m15s)

[up looking like so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m17s)

[something like this and then we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m20s)

[to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m22s)

[do the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m23s)

[wow I'm I'm mildly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m28s)

[impressed okay so uh this is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m32s)

[execute two commands one it's going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m36s)

[build up my my new get package that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m38s)

[contains all my templates and then two](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m40s)

[it's going to force install it right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m41s)

[over the top of whatever is there which](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m43s)

[is important to do especially if you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m45s)

[aren't revving versions so now if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m47s)

[come over here and do the same command](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m49s)

[over we will know that somewhere in here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m51s)

[we will find a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m54s)

[k uh I'm sure there's a way to sort](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m57s)

[these and I just am too stupid to figure](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h04m59s)

[it out but yeah we can now find mine](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m01s)

[that I have in here so I've got a one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m03s)

[for Nate packages I've got a console app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m05s)

[and I've got a WPF app one great fine uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m07s)

[net uh new you got to spell new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m11s)

[correctly that's very](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m14s)

[important uh and so if we do this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m20s)

[oops and this is why it's good to pay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m22s)

[attention to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m24s)

[what what repo or what folder you're in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m26s)

[right so if we go net new uh kabo WPF](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m31s)

[with all net templates there's this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m34s)

[implicit idea that if you don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m36s)

[explicitly specify a name for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m38s)

[template it's just going to use the name](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m40s)

[of the directory in this case test if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m42s)

[were to do this and go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m44s)

[d-el you'll see that um there's some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m46s)

[built-in options that are common across](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m49s)

[other templates being able to specify an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m51s)

[output directory specify a name because](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m53s)

[if you don't do it uh the name of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m56s)

[output directory is used](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h05m58s)

[instead right uh a couple of these](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m00s)

[wonderful things here um and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m03s)

[then my templates have a few](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m06s)

[additional things added on so for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m09s)

[example I have uh a no solution and a no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m11s)

[test because right now my templates are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m15s)

[not file based templates they are not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m18s)

[project templates they are full solution](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m20s)

[templates because my opinion that is the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m22s)

[most uh useful thing that they can do so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m25s)

[if we fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m28s)

[what we should](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m30s)

[see is hopefully a pretty good WPF](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m33s)

[application and this is the thing is I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m36s)

[want it to be good enough that somebody](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m37s)

[could dive in here and get started and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m40s)

[there's a balancing act between I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m42s)

[want to put in too much that I know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m44s)

[people are going to have to delete to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m47s)

[get started with their own app but I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m48s)

[want to have enough there that it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m50s)

[useful right um and maybe maybe with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m52s)

[some turning things on and off so for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m55s)

[example we've got a WPF project](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h06m57s)

[great](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m00s)

[um this is set up and I won't spend a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m01s)

[ton of time diving into it uh if you are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m04s)

[curious on why search my YouTube videos](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m07s)

[for dependency injection it'll explain](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m10s)

[kind of this setup here but this this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m13s)

[gets it going if we fire it up we should](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m15s)

[have a very simple application and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m18s)

[there's quite a bit packed into](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m20s)

[this uh come on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m22s)

[start Okay so we've got click click](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m26s)

[click click click and then you'll know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m28s)

[at five the button disables there's a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m30s)

[clear count that lets you start going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m32s)

[again great uh there's an exit so this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m34s)

[shows off relay commands this shows off](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m37s)

[data binding this shows off the mvvm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m39s)

[toolkit material design and examl all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m41s)

[the things um there's a few kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m44s)

[small things that I'd like to address](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m46s)

[one I think having an icon in here would](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m48s)

[be a good um start um to make that a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m50s)

[little bit better maybe a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m53s)

[self-promotion I don't mind we can do we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m55s)

[can do that um this also goes through](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h07m57s)

[and shows uh basic unit testing setup so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m00s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m04s)

[leveraging uh mock or mock Q as well as](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m05s)

[Auto marker which I'm a contributor for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m08s)

[heavily biased but also showing the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m10s)

[basic patterns of how would you actually](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m13s)

[go through and do these tests now](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m15s)

[there's a couple things in here that I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m18s)

[not a huge fan of uh for example this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m20s)

[thing just blindly calls increment count](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m24s)

[and invokes the execute without](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m26s)

[considering execute and various things](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m28s)

[like that um because this guy clearly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m30s)

[has a can execute so we may want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m33s)

[improve upon that a little bit uh and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m36s)

[make the template better in that regard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m39s)

[so we can probably build out some of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m41s)

[tests as well I've had a lot of people](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m42s)

[also ask for things around like Entity](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m45s)

[framework HTTP client a lot of those](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m47s)

[common use cases](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m49s)

[so I'm trying to decide if I do a single](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m52s)

[template with lots of options or if I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h08m56s)

[do multiple templates I think a single](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m00s)

[template with multiple options is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m03s)

[probably better I think um and I there's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m04s)

[a few there's going to be a balancing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m09s)

[act because before my options are all in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m11s)

[the negative right you're getting the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m13s)

[solution you're getting the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m15s)

[test right if if all you want is the WPF](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m18s)

[project itself you drop the no solution](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m21s)

[drop the test and that mostly gets you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m23s)

[there I don't think no sln is that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m25s)

[valuable at this point](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m27s)

[like all it's dropping is the sln file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m30s)

[there there's kind of there's kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m32s)

[enough here where I'm like you know what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m34s)

[we we probably should go through and do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m35s)

[this this does have an editor config and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m37s)

[I thought I had](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m39s)

[included and maybe I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m41s)

[didn't yeah so apparently I have not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m43s)

[included the exclusions dictionary um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m45s)

[but the editor config does](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m48s)

[have we go to the very bottom of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m54s)

[it I have set it up with the the new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m56s)

[Visual Studio spell checker which I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h09m59s)

[absolutely love very much so if anybody](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m02s)

[is interested you can set this up when](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m07s)

[it first released the big limitation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m09s)

[that I that I was not a fan of was um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m11s)

[the the exclusions dictionary I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m15s)

[all your proper nouns the words that you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m18s)

[just want to tell it shut up about trust](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m20s)

[me this is an okay word um that was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m22s)

[stored at um outside of your repository](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m24s)

[at the user level and I was like I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m28s)

[like that as much now that I can put it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m30s)

[in the repository yeah We're Off to the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m32s)

[Races the other thing here that's worth](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m34s)

[calling out spelling air](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m36s)

[severity uh the even if you crank this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m38s)

[up to air this doesn't actually fail](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m41s)

[your build this severity only controls](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m43s)

[the the severity that it shows up inside](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m47s)

[of your air list or like your output but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m50s)

[it won't actually fail a build so do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m53s)

[with that what you will um as far as I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h10m57s)

[aware I don't know how to make it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m00s)

[actually fail the build um a couple](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m02s)

[other things I'm contemplating that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m04s)

[would be nice to put in here um I would](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m06s)

[love to get zaml Styler plugged in so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m08s)

[that people could go through and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m10s)

[leverage that I'd also like to plug](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m11s)

[in um GitHub actions and similar so that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m14s)

[there's a full build process and all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m17s)

[that J like there's a lot I want to add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m19s)

[to this a lot so we're just we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m21s)

[to just start attacking some of these](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m23s)

[one at a time um I do want to call out](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m24s)

[one thing because I thought it was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m26s)

[rather cool the other day](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m27s)

[because I was I was kind of poking at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m30s)

[these templates and I and I added some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m31s)

[stuff I added some stuff um and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m34s)

[specifically what I added was uh um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m37s)

[testing of my template so you'll know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m41s)

[there's test console test WPF we'll just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m44s)

[focus on the test WPF one so this job](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m46s)

[here it has to run on Windows because it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m49s)

[it's WPF not a shock but it pulls down](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m52s)

[the the built uh Nate pack package in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m56s)

[this case the templates new get package](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h11m59s)

[and then it does Net uh new install so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m02s)

[it pulls the the template package out](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m05s)

[creates a new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m08s)

[directory moves into the directory calls](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m09s)

[net new on the directory and net test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m12s)

[not not a brilliant thing but at least](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m15s)

[validates that the the output of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m17s)

[template one could be installed uh two](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m20s)

[we can gen a template and it compiles in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m23s)

[the test run and I went that's pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m25s)

[good I bad that's not bad that's not bad](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m27s)

[at all okay so we're gonna we're g to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m31s)

[kind of attack some of these various](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m32s)

[things and see what we can do but that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m34s)

[that makes me very very excited for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m37s)

[anybody who wants to get started writing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m40s)

[your own templates let me just call out](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m42s)

[a couple things so my opinion is my net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m43s)

[templates repo isn't a bad place to get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m46s)

[started if you want to see some samples](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m48s)

[the key thing that you do you set up a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m51s)

[project the way you want or you you get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m54s)

[your thing set up the way that you that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m57s)

[the way that you like and then there's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h12m59s)

[this templates config with this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m01s)

[templates.](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m02s)

[Json and the the documentation calls it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m04s)

[here and it links out to like their](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m07s)

[GitHub repo with a lot more information](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m09s)

[as well but the real important things to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m10s)

[go through and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m13s)

[do is set up the metadata for the the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m14s)

[name and description but then this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m17s)

[Source name is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m19s)

[critical right so this Source name says](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m21s)

[okay this is the thing that I'm going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m23s)

[Blind find and replace everything that I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m26s)

[see that's called WPF app I'm going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m29s)

[whatever the name that's being applied](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m32s)

[to the template so you'll recall here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m33s)

[when we didet new the the name that we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m36s)

[were using was the output directory in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m38s)

[this case](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m40s)

[test what this short name says is okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m41s)

[find everywhere where WPF app is used](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m44s)

[and just replace it with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m47s)

[test which you'll know that's why all of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m48s)

[this stuff is named the way that it is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m51s)

[because it makes it real easy now the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m53s)

[hard part is in order to implement some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m55s)

[of like these condition itions and other](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h13m57s)

[similar things you end up kind of having](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m00s)

[to break the idea of being able to just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m03s)

[fire up your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m06s)

[demo easily like normally I could come](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m08s)

[in here I could open up this WPF app. SL](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m11s)

[sln and it would just work the problem](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m14s)

[is is you start doing stuff like this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m16s)

[and that no worky so for example if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m19s)

[come in here uh I don't have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m22s)

[my let's go here uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m26s)

[man so awesome so if we come into net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m29s)

[templates](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m33s)

[templates and we do WPF WPF app all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m35s)

[right we can pop this guy open and we'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m38s)

[see I don't think it actually fully](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m40s)

[loads with those conditions in it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m42s)

[might it might oh it might actually just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m44s)

[work oh okay so we might be in pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m47s)

[good shape the pound ifs may be saving](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m50s)

[us for the moment is it's not a great](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m53s)

[way of testing but it's a great way to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m55s)

[get started so let's let's go through](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m57s)

[and fix a couple things so one I want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h14m58s)

[the exclusions dictionary added into my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m00s)

[solution great we'll do that next thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m02s)

[I want to do is I want to set up an icon](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m05s)

[uh inside of here um and I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m07s)

[think I think I If This Were a brand new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m12s)

[app that I was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m15s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m18s)

[uh I think I would actually put it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m20s)

[inside a resource dictionary now one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m23s)

[second I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m24s)

[is actually we I have a I have the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m26s)

[image if we go up because my library one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m30s)

[has](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m35s)

[a an icon I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m37s)

[believe yeah so we're going to back this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m40s)

[guy up we're just going to steal it from](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m42s)

[there so if we come in here templates](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m44s)

[WPF WPF app WPF app resources](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m47s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m52s)

[um app icon now Shameless self-promote](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m55s)

[motion that's the icon we're going with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h15m58s)

[you'll know it looks real similar](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m01s)

[too that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m04s)

[one I don't do this mired camera thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m06s)

[very well uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m08s)

[okay but if we then come down here and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m11s)

[go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m13s)

[properties and then we come down here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m17s)

[and we go icon where are you there you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m19s)

[are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m27s)

[oh it's not an Ico file that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m29s)

[annoying that is mildly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m32s)

[annoying um let me go and look and see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m35s)

[if I have a version of this that is an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m37s)

[Ico](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m39s)

[file standby because that would be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m40s)

[convenient the other option is we'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m42s)

[just jump over and do a fancy converter](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m44s)

[I wonder if this is what hung me up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m48s)

[before let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m51s)

[see got to go look through my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m54s)

[resources](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h16m57s)

[and everything I have is not an Ico file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m00s)

[but I have my logo in various things so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m05s)

[the logo I can't take much credit for uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m08s)

[my wife uh more or less did the design](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m11s)

[and my mother-in-law is uh has done](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m15s)

[Graphics design and helped get stuff put](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m17s)

[together and then I just used it so I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m20s)

[guess in some way I quote unquote](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m24s)

[approved it uh let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m27s)

[see convert PNG to Ico I don't want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m29s)

[think too hard I don't want to think too](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m32s)

[hard let's see here what do we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m35s)

[got choose](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m39s)

[files one second here and let](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m42s)

[me can I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m45s)

[just can I just do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m48s)

[resources do you accept drag drop if I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m51s)

[just do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m54s)

[boom yeah make it so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h17m56s)

[now in an ideal situation this works in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m02s)

[Scales](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m05s)

[differently download let's take a look](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m09s)

[at what we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m10s)

[got uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m13s)

[boom okay so we're going to come over](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m16s)

[here we're going to go here we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m19s)

[to go here we're going to go here we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m20s)

[going to go here okay boom boom boom I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m21s)

[want to look at the Ico so it just did a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m25s)

[00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,520](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m27s)

128 not a huge fan of how it did

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m33s)

[outlining I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m42s)

[we're going to I I normally don't bother](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m44s)

[to change these things much but we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m46s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m48s)

[do how do I how do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m48s)

[I I want to edit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m51s)

[you I see the Picker where's the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m54s)

[editor](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h18m57s)

[uh what going to make me open an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m01s)

[external editor yuck okay just decided](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m03s)

[that was too much effort we're not going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m05s)

[to waste our time doing it um I also](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m06s)

[have something else that can gen the the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m08s)

[image for me as well but I will do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m11s)

[a little later for now this will be good](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m15s)

[enough to get me get me in for what we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m16s)

[want um okay so that's going to get us](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m19s)

[the app icon there let's fire the app up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m22s)

[and make sure it actually launches with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m25s)

[an icon and looks the way that we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m27s)

[want I wouldn't say the way we want but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m29s)

[it's significantly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m32s)

[better significantly better than the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m33s)

[empty one okay so that gets us there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m35s)

[that gets the exclusions dictionary in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m37s)

[place okay I like that a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m40s)

[better we're going to add this uh let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m43s)

[see create Branch](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m46s)

[WPF icon we're going to just kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m48s)

[ignore the fact that we did the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m51s)

[exclusion](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m52s)

[stuff uh let's see app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m53s)

[icon then the question is do we include](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m56s)

[the PNG or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h19m58s)

[not I think we're going to ignore it for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m01s)

[the moment because it's not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m03s)

[required and we want to discard that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m05s)

[discard that and discard that and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m10s)

[discard that because we all actually I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m13s)

[guess the easier way to have done](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m16s)

[this is would have been to just stage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m19s)

[the one line that I cared about but you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m21s)

[know that would have been simple and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m23s)

[straightforward uh let's see adding app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m24s)

[icon there we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m28s)

[go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m30s)

[boom and then we'll let we'll let that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m32s)

[thing go in PR](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m34s)

[in and then we'll we'll keep we we will](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m37s)

[keep on our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m40s)

[mway and then I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m42s)

[think enable auto merge squash so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m45s)

[wonderful ah and you'll note it's going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m49s)

[to do all of the testing for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m52s)

[me uh okay so we're going to close CL](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m56s)

[that out and we'll let that sit let](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h20m58s)

[that's sit okay so let's see where we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m01s)

[want to go next uh okay so that gets me](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m03s)

[to there that gets me to there that gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m07s)

[me to there um might just delete this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m08s)

[for the moment because I don't think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m12s)

[it's actually buying us anything now um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m13s)

[I think what might be worth doing is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m18s)

[showing how to do the uh can increment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m20s)

[count because this is currently not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m24s)

[being tested so for for example if we go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m27s)

[live unit testing which one live unit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m29s)

[testing is amazing um it is not included](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m31s)

[in all SKS of Visual Studio I can't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m34s)

[remember whether you need Pro or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m37s)

[Enterprise for it but if you're just on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m38s)

[community I'm sorry you don't get this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m40s)

[feature](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m42s)

[uh uh yeah so we'll go ahead and do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m49s)

[I don't think that that changes anything](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m54s)

[in here just want to make sure yeah](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m56s)

[there's no there's no diff there okay so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h21m59s)

[launch it goes and does it so one of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m03s)

[biggest issues I have with live unit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m06s)

[testing is when it fails you don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m08s)

[always know where to look if you go to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m09s)

[your output window this little drop down](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m11s)

[here live unit testing is one of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m14s)

[options in here very very helpful to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m16s)

[understand what's going on often times](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m20s)

[there's some sort of compilation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m21s)

[issue um but I I will constantly see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m23s)

[people run into issues where it's like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m26s)

[why is live unit test not running well](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m28s)

[check the output window it's probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m30s)

[failing to compile for some reason](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m31s)

[another fun one is if your tests have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m33s)

[like a stack Overflow in it that gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m35s)

[interesting so uh don't do that uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m38s)

[that's bad okay so the the issue with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m41s)

[these tests so we can see live unit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m44s)

[testing is really convenient in that it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m47s)

[gives us uh these little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m49s)

[green checks uh but it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m52s)

[also uh gives us these little blue lines](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m55s)

[now a key thing and I I say this to a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h22m58s)

[lot of people uh my strong opinion is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m01s)

[that code coverage is a negative metric](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m05s)

[meaning it is only useful to tell you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m07s)

[what lines have not been tested so I can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m10s)

[say for certain line 29 is not tested](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m13s)

[even though there's little green check](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m17s)

[marks here I cannot tell you if this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m19s)

[method is unit tested or not or if it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m21s)

[even tested well all I can tell you is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m24s)

[that it was executed while running the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m26s)

[tests that's not a real big assumption](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m30s)

[right that just means it executed and it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m33s)

[didn't throw an unhandled exception](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m35s)

[that's a pretty low bar right like the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m37s)

[only way the bar gets lower is did it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m40s)

[compile right and everybody most](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m42s)

[developers they they get at least above](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m45s)

[the compiling bar do they actually get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m47s)

[it to the you know tested and whatnot so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m49s)

[this can increment count is not uh doing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m52s)

[well and I would argue we should](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m55s)

[actually do better on uh this command](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h23m57s)

[here so what we are going to do is we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m01s)

[are going to come in here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m04s)

[um and I want to show off because these](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m07s)

[are just showing facts they aren't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m10s)

[showing theories now in xunit the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m11s)

[difference between a fact and a theory](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m15s)

[is a fact is a method that takes no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m17s)

[parameters and a theory actually takes](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m20s)

[in parameters uh so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m23s)

[with um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m26s)

[uh count so let's do int count right so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m29s)

[we're going to do uh can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m34s)

[execute](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m37s)

[uh uh uh let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m40s)

[see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m46s)

[indicates if count is less than](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m48s)

[five okay now you'll note we're also](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m54s)

[already getting an air here saying count](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h24m57s)

[is not used an xunit has a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m00s)

[analyzers built in and it's properly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m03s)

[calling out that go and hang on you've](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m05s)

[got a theory method here Theory methods](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m06s)

[take](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m09s)

[parameters you've passed no parameters](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m10s)

[all right so there's it calls out the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m13s)

[the three ways to go through and do this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m15s)

[are inline data member data and class](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m16s)

[data inline data is by far the easiest](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m19s)

[because you can literally just you know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m23s)

[do that and we're done right the problem](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m25s)

[with inline data is it uses an attribute](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m27s)

[and attributes require their parameters](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m30s)

[to be compile time constants so this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m32s)

[works great if the values you want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m36s)

[pass are constant imagine if this were](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m38s)

[like a guid and you want to do guid new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m41s)

[GID or they were a datetime object and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m43s)

[you want to do datetime.now or whatever](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m46s)

[right so real quick just to show off the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m48s)

[other one so uh public IE](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m50s)

[innumerable of uh object array](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m53s)

[uh I don't know get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h25m58s)

[values right so you can do this if you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m01s)

[do something like member data what you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m04s)

[end up doing is you do name of and then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m07s)

[get values right and so this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m10s)

[here must refer to a static member](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m14s)

[forgot it needed to be static and then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m17s)

[you have to have the correct number of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m20s)

[closing par ends because the compiler is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m21s)

[a little picky about that but now if you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m23s)

[want to do generated stuff you know this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m25s)

[is an i inumerable of object array so we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m28s)

[would do something like uh yield](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m31s)

[return uh new and you often times have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m35s)

[to do object array because if you do an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m38s)

[implicitly typed array uh it guesses](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m40s)

[wrong but for example this would this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m43s)

[would be one run and for each for each](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m47s)

[run in here that's how many times your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m50s)

[test is going to get executed in this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m52s)

[case four it's a little obnoxious](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m53s)

[because you'll note like the the live](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m55s)

[unit testing doesn't detect that this is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m57s)

[being executed you can get into some fun](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h26m59s)

[situations for like code coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m01s)

[metrics if you do it over your test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m03s)

[project where it doesn't quite](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m05s)

[match whatever um but just know that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m06s)

[this is the other way of doing it the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m09s)

[class data is another option rather than](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m11s)

[a member which is either a method or a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m13s)

[property um you actually create a class](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m17s)

[that deriv from here and then that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m20s)

[what gets used instead so uh I find that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m23s)

[member data and inline data are by far](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m27s)

[the most common ones that I use I I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m29s)

[rarely use the class data because it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m31s)

[kind of rare that I want to share some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m33s)

[Source data across multiple test classes](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m35s)

[sometimes but it it doesn't happen that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m38s)

[much okay so we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m40s)

[like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m42s)

[this two three four five right and then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m44s)

[because we're going to do some balance](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m49s)

[checking okay so here's what we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m52s)

[to do we're going to go here we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m54s)

[to go view model do count gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h27m56s)

[count and now here's where people get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m00s)

[real confused really fast because you'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m02s)

[know we fed in a whole bunch of values](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m04s)

[and what we actually want to assert on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m08s)

[right so we want to actually test the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m10s)

[can execute uh bu can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m13s)

[execute um down here we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m18s)

[want the so the assert methods are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m23s)

[always expected followed by actual so in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m26s)

[this case the actual value is what we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m29s)

[got from the ACT portion of our test and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m32s)

[the problem is is people get down here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m35s)

[and they usually end up doing something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m36s)

[like this let's see if count greater](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m38s)

[than or equal to five then what we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m40s)

[going to do is you know assert equal to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m43s)

[True](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m47s)

[otherwise uh else we'll do assert equal](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m50s)

[false or assert false or whatever right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m54s)

[I'm assert me this that's all it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m56s)

[yelling at yeah it wants me to use](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h28m58s)

[assert false whatever](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m00s)

[um I'm intentionally using assert equals](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m03s)

[for the moment to to make a point uh and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m05s)

[we look at this and we realize that it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m08s)

[less than five so if count](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m10s)

[is uh oh greater than or equal to five](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m14s)

[it's because I did my logic](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m16s)

[backwards that it doesn't work right B](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m19s)

[Bo](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m21s)

[boom uh and you have to actually have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m23s)

[valid code](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m26s)

[there we go okay so all of the test pass](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m28s)

[if we look at our testing window you'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m31s)

[see that I can expand this out and it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m32s)

[shows me the the test executions for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m34s)

[each of the values and you could look at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m36s)

[each one of them if there was a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m38s)

[particular one that was failing but this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m39s)

[sort of thing is bad so in general you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m42s)

[want to avoid loops and conditions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m45s)

[inside of your unit tests um if at all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m47s)

[possible the there well there's one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m50s)

[common exception and I I'll get to it in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m53s)

[a moment but the the rational here is is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m55s)

[tests should be as absolutely](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h29m58s)

[deterministic as possible you do not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m00s)

[want tests that are doing something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m02s)

[different conditions always offer you an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m04s)

[opportunity to mess up Loops are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m07s)

[basically just fancy conditions they](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m09s)

[offer you an opportunity to mess up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m11s)

[because by definition unless it's an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m13s)

[infinite Loop every Loop construct has](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m14s)

[an exit condition or a termination](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m17s)

[condition so the better way to write](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m20s)

[this is uh bu uh expected right so now](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m23s)

[what we do is we go okay well let's come](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m30s)

[up here and we're going to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m32s)

[with expected and then rather than just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m34s)

[the values let's see 1 2 3](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m37s)

[4 uh let's see uh if it's less we expect](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m41s)

[can execute to be true but once we hit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m44s)

[five and above we expect false so now](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m46s)

[what we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m50s)

[have is we have a single assert](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m51s)

[statement we've gotten rid of our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m54s)

[condition and now it's just a matter of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m55s)

[making sure that our source data is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m57s)

[correct this is a very common pattern to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h30m58s)

[be able to go through and do this to mix](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m00s)

[it up if you do put a condition in your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m02s)

[code because for whatever reason it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m05s)

[makes it makes more sense always always](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m08s)

[make sure you're handling the opposite](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m12s)

[the the else side of the condition right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m14s)

[because for example if you write um a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m17s)

[common one that I see happen is like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m20s)

[for uh let's see for each VAR item in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m23s)

[you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m29s)

[know array.](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m31s)

[empty uh I don't know whatever](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m34s)

[right assert equal you know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m38s)

[42 item right now array. empty kind kind](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m43s)

[of gives away the ending of this but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m48s)

[this kind of pattern I see occur in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m51s)

[tests all the time and the problem is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m52s)

[there's nothing guaranteeing what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m55s)

[whatever collection you're iterating](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m57s)

[over actually has the items so you might](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h31m58s)

[actually have ended up by accident](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m01s)

[getting yourself into a situation where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m04s)

[your uh iteration isn't doing anything](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m07s)

[the the the times where I will allow](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m10s)

[this through or or I won't Heckle my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m13s)

[team quite as much is if you do like an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m15s)

[assert equal you know uh 42 and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m17s)

[then collection. count right so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m23s)

[if it's something like this this is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m27s)

[where this is where I I kind of allow it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m30s)

[because you've now done something in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m32s)

[your test very explicitly because a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m34s)

[condition or an if um poses some risk](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m36s)

[that you've accidentally introduced a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m40s)

[bug in your test because our tests are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m42s)

[supposed to catch the bugs in our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m44s)

[code the best way to avoid bugs is to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m46s)

[have no Loops no conditions right bugs](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m49s)

[typically come around loops and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m52s)

[conditions so if you get rid of those](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m54s)

[you're less likely to have bugs you do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m57s)

[not want bugs in your tests because your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h32m59s)

[code Rises to whatever quality level](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m01s)

[your tests are at so if your tests are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m03s)

[crap your code Rises to the level of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m05s)

[crap it's not a great way of doing this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m07s)

[um but if you do need to go through and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m10s)

[do a loop because you know maybe maybe](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m12s)

[there legitimately is you know 120 items](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m14s)

[in dear Heavens you're not going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m17s)

[write that many asserts that's fine](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m18s)

[Right Guard yourself against the empty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m21s)

[case or the early exit case asserts on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m23s)

[things like the collections. count or if](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m26s)

[you have to put in an if condition make](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m28s)

[sure that you're explicitly putting in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m30s)

[an else that way in the event that uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m32s)

[something goes wrong you're actually](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m35s)

[catching it the other thing is is with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m37s)

[like code coverage metrics often times](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m39s)

[if you're putting in that else condition](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m41s)

[you if you're measuring code coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m44s)

[for your test project you'll often take](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m45s)

[a hit because they'll go this line isn't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m48s)

[executed and the instinct is to say well](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m50s)

[this wasn't executed as part of the test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m52s)

[it's in a unit test project I should](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m54s)

[delete it the problem is is that's a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m55s)

[little bit of uh what is it survivor](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h33m58s)

[bias because the only code that we merge](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m00s)

[in is code that passes all the tests hey](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m03s)

[JB script and if the only code that that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m06s)

[uh gets merged into your main branch is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m10s)

[the stuff that pass the test your else](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m12s)

[conditions never hit but you really want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m14s)

[that else condition to guard you against](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m16s)

[when you do introduce a bug so just be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m18s)

[aware of that okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m21s)

[anyway we now have a test it adds in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m23s)

[canx Ute handling I think this does a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m26s)

[better job of showing people better](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m28s)

[better testing of this it doesn't really](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m31s)

[show commands with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m33s)

[parameters but I think that's okay I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m37s)

[think that's okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m39s)

[um great reset local here we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m42s)

[go here and then we're just going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m45s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m47s)

[do uh we don't need this anymore](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m49s)

[delete and then yeah](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m54s)

[uh don't need you anymore either delete](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h34m57s)

[uh okay so let's create a new one create](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m00s)

[Branch](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m02s)

[WPF uh more](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m03s)

[tests okay and then let's pop this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m06s)

[here and we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m09s)

[say uh adding test to WPF for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m18s)

[um it's a good way of doing this for can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m19s)

[execute okay now I think what would be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m23s)

[nice is actually implementing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m28s)

[hole if I do that probably but that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m38s)

[probably okay right so enable auto](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m40s)

[merge does this not have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m45s)

[a thought there was a way to maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m49s)

[getting devops confused I thought there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m52s)

[was a way to tell it on auto merge to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m54s)

[Nuke the source branch is that in the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h35m56s)

[look](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h37m37s)

[at simply budget it probably has a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h37m38s)

[reasonable starting workflow that I can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h37m43s)

[where where I've done a reasonable](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m28s)

[amount of stuff see I don't think this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m31s)

[is actually what we want but we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m33s)

[to get part of the way](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m36s)

[here um and actually I want to poach a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m39s)

[little bit because this is why I want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m42s)

[change up my templates because not all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m44s)

[of this is great so there is so this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m46s)

[pointer star thing uh is a wonderful](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m49s)

[little app so pointer star.com](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m53s)

[uh uh not point star don't know where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m57s)

[that's going to take me let's try that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h47m59s)

[again](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m11s)

[huh note to self fix that anyway it's a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m18s)

[little uh pointing po type site where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m23s)

[people can dive in and we leverage it on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m26s)

[our stuff anyway um the important thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m29s)

[here that I wanted to highlight is on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m31s)

[some of these poll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m33s)

[requests uh let's pick on one that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m36s)

[actually legit right so I added in some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m38s)

[spell check stuff is I have this set up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m40s)

[where it runs code coverage and we do a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m43s)

[sticky comment here that it'll update](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m46s)

[showing you what your code coverage is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m48s)

[which is a rather clever thing to have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m49s)

[the problem is is doing this is not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m52s)

[doing this well is not exactly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m54s)

[trivial](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m56s)

[um and the reason is is you want your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h48m57s)

[workflows to have permissions to be able](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m01s)

[to post those](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m04s)

[comments right you want you you want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m06s)

[your action to have those permissions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m08s)

[but if you're doing something say open](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m10s)

[source and and you're potentially](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m12s)

[worried about exposing secrets that gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m14s)

[to be a little interesting because your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m17s)

[GitHub token by default only has read](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m20s)

[permissions not write and if you want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m22s)

[be able to post comments back you need](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m24s)

[to have it have right permissions so for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m27s)

[example uh inside of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m32s)

[here um this little uh GitHub token down](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m35s)

[here right this is what's actually](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m39s)

[letting it go through and uh run](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m42s)

[properly and I think this is what we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m46s)

[want to set](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m47s)

[up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m51s)

[yeah I think I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m54s)

[we're going to do something like this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m56s)

[we're going to add this into a workflows](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m57s)

[folder grab that save and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h49m59s)

[then one moment I just got to find my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m05s)

[way back](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m08s)

[in okay so we'll go here we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m10s)

[create a new folder here called uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m12s)

[workflows this is a GitHub actions thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m15s)

[that is name name is important uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m18s)

[workflows great we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m22s)

[and then I I kind of am tempted to just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m26s)

[use](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m29s)

[the this guy here for a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m30s)

[this yeah we're going to download this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m38s)

[as a starting template to work with um I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m41s)

[it's not it's not going to be right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m45s)

[uh um I always I I never know what to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m51s)

[name my my name my main template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h50m54s)

[uh yeah whatever we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m00s)

[that for now I can't think of a better](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m02s)

[name uh okay so let's open this guy up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m05s)

[in maybe a vs code Type solution I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m08s)

[think uh show more options](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m14s)

[code okay so we're going to go in here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m19s)

[for the moment we've got a workflow](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m21s)

[thing probably need go and add it to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m23s)

[uh probably need to go and add it to the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m30s)

[solution but we can do that in a moment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m32s)

[okay so we're going to do on push on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m34s)

[poll request and manual](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m38s)

[dispatch uh we're going to change this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m40s)

[to uh build uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m44s)

[WPF app so subtle trick there right I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m47s)

[called this build WPF app this is now](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m50s)

[going to change to whatever the name of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m53s)

[our app is I think that's kind of clever](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m55s)

[um this versioning is this the way we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h51m59s)

[want to do versioning I don't think it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m02s)

[is I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m04s)

[mean oh man I go back and forth on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m06s)

[whether I like this style of versioning](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m08s)

[or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m11s)

[not do we version the app so the the two](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m11s)

[ways that I like is managing the version](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m16s)

[number internally inside of here and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m20s)

[managing the version number inside of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m22s)

[here we're going to do it entirely in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m29s)

[here for now there's some Ms build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m32s)

[properties like build suffix and that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m34s)

[kind of thing and we could go back and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m36s)

[forth and that's often how people will](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m37s)

[tack on like- C or similar it's like I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m39s)

[don't know I don't know we'll we'll go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m43s)

[with this here uh the important part](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m45s)

[here is it does run net build and it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m47s)

[runs net test um this generates a code](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m49s)

[coverage report um and the way you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m53s)

[actually get this working is this--](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m56s)

[collect this crossplatform coverage and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h52m58s)

[then we just give it a well-known output](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m01s)

[directory so that we can point this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m03s)

[at it and it's going to generate it in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m05s)

[both an HTML version as well as a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m07s)

[markdown version we have to write the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m09s)

[poll request number out to something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m12s)

[that we can use as an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m14s)

[artifact we're going to upload the code](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m16s)

[coverage and then we're going to net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m20s)

[publish the app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m23s)

[and I'm thinking what we might want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m29s)

[do is this in both cases rather than](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m31s)

[doing a relative directory](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m34s)

[here either that or we should do a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m38s)

[relative directory in both](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m40s)

[cases or we could](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m45s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m52s)

[yeah you know what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m53s)

[we're going to do that for the well no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m56s)

[we should fully qualify it I'm I'm just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h53m59s)

[wondering if maybe I should do something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m01s)

[up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m02s)

[here for it versus down here and I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m04s)

[wondering if this should actually be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m07s)

[this and if this should actually be this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m10s)

[let's go with that for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m14s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m17s)

[um going to do that this is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m20s)

[need to be a Windows](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m24s)

[latest you can technically compile on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m26s)

[there but typically when you go to run](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m30s)

[your tests um even though you can build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m31s)

[uh outside of windows the moment you try](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m35s)

[to execute anything you're inside of WPF](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m37s)

[application that's no not going to work](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m40s)

[we'll do a net publish if it's not a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m42s)

[poll request and then we'll upload the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m44s)

[publish if it's not there and I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m47s)

[that's probably as far as we'll go here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m49s)

[I don't think we actually want to do do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m53s)

[a a deployment of any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h54m56s)

[kind we'll see we might we might get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m00s)

[fancy we might it fancy okay so we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m02s)

[going to do that we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m04s)

[and then we're going to come over](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m07s)

[here code coverage PR comment uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m09s)

[workflows oh we need it to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m14s)

[be this needs to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m20s)

[be this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m23s)

[this so that it knows to run after that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m26s)

[workflow and then it will download that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m30s)

[pull request number GitHub token ingest](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m33s)

[it and then go ahead and post it okay so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m37s)

[I think all this works I think all this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m41s)

[works now step](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m44s)

[one uh let's go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m46s)

[here build pack do all the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m49s)

[needful then here we're not even going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m53s)

[to we're not even going to pretend to be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m55s)

[fancy we're just going to say override](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h55m58s)

[everything okay so we should have a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m00s)

[GitHub directory we should have all the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m02s)

[things we're going to need to make sure](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m04s)

[those things get added to the solution](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m06s)

[but we'll deal with that in a moment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m08s)

[what I'm most interested in right now is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m10s)

[leveraging this guy to push out a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m12s)

[repo um what's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m17s)

[the create one uh let's do GitHub me](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m20s)

[uh W uh PF template test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m25s)

[testing uh let's see we're going to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m31s)

[browse and I want to go down to my temp](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m33s)

[directory and I want to do test and I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m36s)

[want to do select](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m39s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m42s)

[uh no I actually want to go up a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m44s)

[directory apparently I want to go here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m46s)

[and I want to call this test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m48s)

[main oh do we not have a get ignore file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m52s)

[or a license](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m54s)

[file that's interesting should we have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m56s)

[an ignore and a license file don't know](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h56m59s)

[create](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m03s)

[repository](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m04s)

[uh temp test is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m10s)

[not yeah I know that was kind of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m14s)

[point](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m17s)

[uh moment go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m22s)

[here uh what is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m32s)

[the I want to initialize repo that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m35s)

[what I want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m38s)

[do not clone that that's what I did](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m40s)

[wrong uh uh template test public clone](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m43s)

[after a knit I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m49s)

[don't gu I do want to clone](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m53s)

[it uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h57m57s)

[browse I do want temp oh that's already](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=00h58m01s)

[uh whatever we'll look at we'll look at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m25s)

[its failure in just a moment this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m26s)

[fired](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m29s)

[off and we appear to have GitHub actions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m30s)

[already ready to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m32s)

[go okay so need to do a little work for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m37s)

[some setting up of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m41s)

[repository I think that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m44s)

[seems that seems like a thing we want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m47s)

[do um I'm very tempted to just GitHub CL](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m50s)

[Li this to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m54s)

[Victory](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m57s)

[um we'll we'll see where this goes so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h01m59s)

[you'll know this is now building 1.0.2](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m02s)

[and this may versioning of the app is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m05s)

[one of those areas that there's there's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m07s)

[plenty of debate about which way people](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m10s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m12s)

[go um what I would love to see though](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m13s)

[is this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m17s)

[workflow run PR Comet so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m25s)

[that that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m27s)

[triggered a little curious why that one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m31s)

[triggered already I would have kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m33s)

[expected it to trigger later but we'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m35s)

[wait and see where this gets us to um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m38s)

[okay well that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m41s)

[running because you're thinking about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m45s)

[about how to do this because ideally](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m47s)

[when we do net new we would like the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m49s)

[GitHub action already set up and ready](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m51s)

[to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m53s)

[um let's let's fix the solution file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h02m55s)

[next I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m00s)

[think yeah let's let's fix the solution](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m03s)

[file we're going to just pop this guy](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m06s)

[open and we're going to come in here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m10s)

[we're going to come in here we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m12s)

[to do add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m13s)

[folder workflows and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m16s)

[come in here and we're going to go add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m18s)

[existing item GitHub work](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m21s)

[flows](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m25s)

[add save close and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m27s)

[whack the vs directory so I don't have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m31s)

[to deal with it and then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m33s)

[come over to my diff on the template and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m37s)

[I only I want to discard discard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m40s)

[discard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m46s)

[discard discard because I'd like to uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m48s)

[keep those pound ifs in but have all of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m51s)

[this uh generated out for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m54s)

[me and that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h03m57s)

[makes that makes this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m00s)

[muchas](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m03s)

[okay so we're going to Stage that stage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m04s)

[stage stage and we're going to see what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m08s)

[we've what horribleness we've done okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m11s)

[so back over to here net test has](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m14s)

[failed uh let's see here so we ran a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m18s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m21s)

[here oh this is a bad results directory](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m22s)

[uh let's see so let's go uh because we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m26s)

[kind of want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m29s)

[do um repo rout](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m32s)

[so GitHub](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m35s)

[actions uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m38s)

[documentation uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m40s)

[context think it's the the thingy we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m42s)

[want um so just for people's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m47s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m53s)

[this guy here the EnV variable I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m55s)

[think that's what we want I think we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h04m59s)

[actually so we could go with the EMV](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m00s)

[context but I believe](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m03s)

[the what we actually want to do is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m05s)

[something like this and there is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m07s)

[something like repo rout or similar in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m09s)

[here uh let's see Event Event](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m13s)

[name uh that's not it GitHub ref ref](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m18s)

[name reposit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m22s)

[I want the root directory is what I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m26s)

[want triggering](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m29s)

[action default working directory of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m31s)

[rumor for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m34s)

[steps so we probably want to use this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m35s)

[instead that's what I see I knew it was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m37s)

[in there somewhere so and I think what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m40s)

[we're going to do is we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m42s)

[change this up just a little bit so I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m43s)

[think what I would like to do is do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m46s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m48s)

[slash. uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m50s)

[B build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m52s)

[I think this is actually what I want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m55s)

[leverage uh so let's see we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h05m58s)

[do this and I realize I'm using forward](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m01s)

[slashes on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m04s)

[Windows I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m06s)

[care](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m09s)

[um yes so we're going to do that we're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m18s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m20s)

[that going do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m23s)

[that that that looks good](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m25s)

[there uh that looks good there that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m29s)

[looks good there okay so we're just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m32s)

[going to slap it into a do build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m36s)

[directory which is probably just fine](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m38s)

[there's secretly an idea that I have for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m40s)

[other things that I'd like to put in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m42s)

[here um for rerouting your bin and obj](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m44s)

[directory but going to try this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m47s)

[first uh okay so we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m50s)

[and then we're going to come back over](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m53s)

[here rebuild the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h06m56s)

[template and here we're just going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m01s)

[reapply it and that means that in our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m03s)

[test repo we should see a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m06s)

[change uh let's see so we've got all of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m08s)

[that great what is the directory build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m11s)

[props uh it's a new secret ID sure fine](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m14s)

[whatever uh solution file update sure](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m17s)

[fine whatever okay updates to to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m20s)

[build um and I think what I'd like to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m26s)

[is I would like to create a branch and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m30s)

[go test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m32s)

[PR and then we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m35s)

[because I want to test the pr flow into](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m37s)

[here so we're going to do this push test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m39s)

[push](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m43s)

[test and then this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m44s)

[should this should trigger a build out](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m47s)

[on our remote Repository](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m51s)

[so we go poll requests are open great](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m56s)

[great this guy is going to queue up in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h07m59s)

[fire](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m02s)

[wonderful and then hopefully if this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m05s)

[works works as expected what I want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m08s)

[see happen is the um code coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m10s)

[report get generated and posted on the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m13s)

[pr so we're just going to verify both of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m20s)

[those work really quick](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m22s)

[by really quick we'll give this well I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m27s)

[what else um I am trying to decide if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m37s)

[want to do something interesting where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m40s)

[we we publish the app out to like um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m42s)

[GitHub releases but I'm thinking we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m47s)

[might just stop here this has the app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m48s)

[uploaded as a build artifact and then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m52s)

[people can start to work out from there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m54s)

[because there's not a there's not a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m56s)

[universal deployment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h08m58s)

[it on another build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m41s)

[recently oh I did on my net templates](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m43s)

[one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m46s)

[duh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m47s)

[um down here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m51s)

[Auto merge we would](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m54s)

[like Auto merge enabled so what this is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h09m56s)

[actually going to do is automatically](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m00s)

[merge dependabot PRS now this one does](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m03s)

[require that youve set up Auto merge on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m08s)

[your repository which is exactly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m10s)

[what um the the setup repost script does](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m13s)

[so this one I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m18s)

[going to p this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m23s)

[in let's see I want a collapse build for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m24s)

[the moment Auto merge what is your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m28s)

[unknown](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m30s)

[out](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m41s)

[um and specifically call out the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m44s)

[requirements to be able to leverage it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m52s)

[or maybe I leave or maybe we document it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m54s)

[and then enable it so for GitHub actions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h10m57s)

[you can always just copy the name and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m01s)

[it'll jump you right to the repo](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m11s)

[um you do need to add this in though](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m13s)

[because in order for the auto merge to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m17s)

[work this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m19s)

[um so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m22s)

[let's let's do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m24s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m30s)

[for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m31s)

[GitHub uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m33s)

[Auto merge to work it must be enabled on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m36s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m42s)

[repo uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m46s)

[so we'll do something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m48s)

[uh mation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m52s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m55s)

[um this can be done with the and I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h11m57s)

[going to grab the path to my script in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m00s)

[the root of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m03s)

[repo set up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m05s)

[repo yeah so you have to actually turn](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m09s)

[this sucker on in order to make it work](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m12s)

[but we will we will do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m15s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m20s)

[documentation in these](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m32s)

[templates uh this will](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m33s)

[automatically merge uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m38s)

[depend about PRS](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m43s)

[build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m52s)

[uh uh this will](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m55s)

[automatically actually we should do this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h12m57s)

[automatically](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m00s)

[Mark uh PRS](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m01s)

[from uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m11s)

[with auto](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m13s)

[merge this allows them to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m16s)

[automatically complete](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m21s)

[if they pass the rest of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m24s)

[CI okay so we'll do something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m30s)

[that that gets it in that gets that set](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m34s)

[up blah blah blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m37s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m40s)

[okay did this thing fail](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m42s)

[again so excited so excited pipelines so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m45s)

[so much fun okay so what is your problem](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m49s)

[here uh uh gl. net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m52s)

[tool report file build coverage no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h13m56s)

[matching files so when this thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m01s)

[executed it did not generate any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m04s)

[matching files which means](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m06s)

[here uh this did not generate any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m11s)

[matching files so the important thing to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m15s)

[test now is we grab this come to the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m17s)

[root of our repo and we just run it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m20s)

[locally](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m22s)

[uh we don't need the fully qualified we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m25s)

[can do something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m27s)

[this oh I did configuration the release](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m32s)

[with Dash Das no build there is no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m35s)

[configuration release so we're going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m38s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m40s)

[that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m44s)

[what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m48s)

[uh that test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h14m51s)

[okay we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m21s)

[vity um so that ran the build but didn't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m25s)

[execute any tests uh let's turn the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m29s)

[verbosity down so I can find what I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m32s)

[need uh let's see done building](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m34s)

[project it's like it's not finding any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m40s)

[tests to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m42s)

[run well that doesn't seem right let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m44s)

[fire this up and take a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m47s)

[look](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m52s)

[oh is this because of the the nougat](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m54s)

[package problem I saw like dependabot](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m56s)

[triggered an update I wonder if that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h15m59s)

[uh show me the updated package](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m03s)

[xunit update the if packages are out of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m07s)

[sync this can happen quite a bit so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m11s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m13s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m22s)

[save What's the diff on this thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m25s)

[now there is configuration being added](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m39s)

[for another row](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m44s)

[here where is these ones being](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m48s)

[referenced](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m52s)

[something is up here oh the test project](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m54s)

[didn't have a configuration set up in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m57s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m59s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h16m59s)

[oh is that part of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m02s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m06s)

[uh that could be part of the problem](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m08s)

[test Explorer let's take a look at what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m10s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m12s)

[shows can I run all tests here I expect](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m13s)

[to see all the test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m16s)

[path okay uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m20s)

[here test let's just take a quick ganner](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m24s)

[because I think there is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m27s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m32s)

[a PL](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m33s)

[filter](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m36s)

[settings all that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m40s)

[fine okay so let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m46s)

[do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m52s)

[aha okay so revving](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m55s)

[xunit and actually setting this up then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h17m58s)

[fixes that so what we would like to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m01s)

[is come back to our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m04s)

[template and we would like to grab our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m06s)

[solution file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m10s)

[here so this says if no](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m12s)

[tests ah we lost a bang somewhere](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m16s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m21s)

[so that that's that's the the reason for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m24s)

[that missing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m27s)

[bit um so that's just a straight up bug](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m29s)

[in the template and then we will rev the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m31s)

[packages to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m34s)

[253 uh in our packages props](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m38s)

[to 253 because we have a disjoint](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m42s)

[between our xunit and our Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m45s)

[Runner and then that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m48s)

[should build our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m51s)

[template and then let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h18m58s)

[do this guy reapply the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m04s)

[template so let's see what it pick up so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m09s)

[it picked up the auto merge](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m11s)

[great uh new secret in the props](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m13s)

[whatever new get package rev we expect](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m16s)

[solution file change we expect excellent](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m18s)

[uh is template with tests so now that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m23s)

[should fix our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m30s)

[PR we should see the dependabot pr](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m33s)

[automatically close itself because it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m36s)

[should see that once uh once ours merges](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m38s)

[it should take](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m42s)

[over so this one should just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m43s)

[automatically finish because it's going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m46s)

[to check the pr and realize you're not a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m48s)

[dependabot PR it finishes successfully](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m49s)

[it just doesn't do anything right if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m52s)

[look at the the output from it says yeah](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m54s)

[dependabot didn't open this so I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h19m58s)

[skipping this I'm not going to touch it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h20m00s)

[okay this guy's going to build test and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h20m02s)

[hopefully run somewhat](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h20m05s)

[quickish but that will get him going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h20m08s)

[completely with a full pipeline report](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h20m11s)

[you can configure all of this stuff and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m19s)

[you can do it in side of um here but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m21s)

[more importantly you can also configure](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m25s)

[it uh if we look at the material design](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m27s)

[project there is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m33s)

[actually store your preferred settings](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m41s)

[in the repo and then as long as everyone](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m44s)

[working on the repo has their own um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m47s)

[or has the extension installed you're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m54s)

[fine um and as you can see the zaml](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m56s)

[styler extension supports pretty much](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h21m59s)

[any editor you would care about um and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m02s)

[do is I'm going to shamelessly steal](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m16s)

[this one right out of the material](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m19s)

[design project and then I'm going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m21s)

[to Let's see we put this at the root of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m27s)

[repo which is going to be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m29s)

[here okay yeah I delete the txt and it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m34s)

[puts it right back excellent I was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m37s)

[worried it would be easy okay so that is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m39s)

[going to get us a what I think is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m42s)

[probably a pretty close to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m46s)

[reasonable](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m48s)

[um zaml style or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m50s)

[file](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m54s)

[uh and then let's go ahead and open this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m55s)

[guy up I want to add him into the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h22m59s)

[existing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m06s)

[item and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m08s)

[then this brings this in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m11s)

[here and then I'd like to go through and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m14s)

[just make sure that this thing is now](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m17s)

[formatted according to that because](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m19s)

[that's kind of an important](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m23s)

[detail um I think it's probably pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m26s)

[close because I think the default](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m28s)

[settings that I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m30s)

[have match it pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m32s)

[there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m40s)

[none it's pretty small edit why do you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m42s)

[think you have oh this I'm looking at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m46s)

[the wrong thing it's in the net template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m47s)

[so let's take a look here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m50s)

[uh this file contents are unchanged](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m54s)

[excellent I was worried it would make](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m58s)

[sense okay so that will get me to there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h23m59s)

[close that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m05s)

[down um and that will clean up the zaml](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m07s)

[styler for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m13s)

[me I like it I like it I like it I like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m15s)

[it okay but I want to go back into the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m17s)

[solution discard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m20s)

[discard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m23s)

[discard discard discard I would like to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m25s)

[keep those we're going to add zaml](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m29s)

[Styler](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m32s)

[in actually you know what we should do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m33s)

[we should unstage this because I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m35s)

[we're going to end up putting this in a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m36s)

[little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m38s)

[differently okay let's check our build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m40s)

[because we're probably close to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m42s)

[done excellent it looks like we failed](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m44s)

[yet](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m46s)

[again what did we fail on now right PR](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m48s)

[number](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m51s)

[um could not find part of the path so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m54s)

[when this thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h24m58s)

[ran build.](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m03s)

[coverage uh let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m07s)

[see I think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m11s)

[is yeah cuz this tried to run Echo and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m18s)

[then this command here which I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m22s)

[just straight up fails in the event that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m24s)

[the part of the directory doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m27s)

[so if we go to our test](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m28s)

[directory and we take our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m30s)

[terminal um and we change this because](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m33s)

[we can do relative pathing here and we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m35s)

[do this can not find part of it so if we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m38s)

[do mk. build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m43s)

[do coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m48s)

[report](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m51s)

[then it works yeah so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m53s)

[um I think that's what we want to end up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h25m57s)

[doing is make directory because I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m00s)

[believe you can just blindly file make](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m04s)

[directory multiple](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m06s)

[times uh maybe we should do this as new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m08s)

[item](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m12s)

[um item](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m16s)

[type](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m18s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m21s)

[a name](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m22s)

[value uh where is the I guess I could](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m26s)

[turn off air](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m29s)

[action also just do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m32s)

[Force I think that's ultimate like I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m38s)

[don't I just want to tell it I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m40s)

[care so let's do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m43s)

[instead We'll add that into the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m46s)

[template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m51s)

[so workflows](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m56s)

[build and this is going to be down where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h26m58s)

[it writes the pr](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m00s)

[number uh let's see we will do that we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m03s)

[are going to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m07s)

[here like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m15s)

[that yeah uh okay so we will come to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m19s)

[test oh we did it in the wrong place](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m25s)

[didn't we yeah so we're going to delete](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m28s)

[this and then we are going to rebuild](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m32s)

[our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m34s)

[template going to reapply our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m38s)

[template and then we are going to come](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m42s)

[over here and go let's see that's what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m44s)

[we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m48s)

[expect new secret don't care](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m48s)

[formatting don't care that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m53s)

[much](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m56s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h27m59s)

[this deleted these again why is it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m02s)

[deleting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m05s)

[these that shouldn't be happening](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m08s)

[discard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m11s)

[selection um why did it do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m12s)

[that did I botch my template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m16s)

[again oh interesting it's dropping the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m21s)

[bang](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m27s)

[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m33s)

[interesting interesting interesting okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m35s)

[I might have to go back and play around](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m37s)

[with that because I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m39s)

[there's a bug in the get Kracken revert](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m40s)

[line that'd be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m44s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m51s)

[net](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m56s)

[new okay let's check this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h28m59s)

[again that lines up with what I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m02s)

[expecting that doesn't hurt me that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m05s)

[doesn't hurt me the key change is that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m07s)

[one there great uh fixing missing path](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m10s)

[for PR version](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m15s)

[number commit push](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m19s)

[then at the end of this we're just going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m23s)

[to end up nuking the whole thing so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m24s)

[that'll bring in zaml](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m25s)

[Styler um I'm wondering do we add in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m28s)

[anything for auto format of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m33s)

[repo do we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m35s)

[care so for example zaml Styler](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m38s)

[console uh if we look at their docks I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m42s)

[believe they've](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m45s)

[got this guy as AET tool so we could add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m47s)

[it as a tool and do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m52s)

[something local but I don't know if](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m55s)

[that's actually what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h29m57s)

[people want I may just leave it as the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m00s)

[style or settings are added in the repo](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m05s)

[and it's up to other people to decide](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m08s)

[what they want to do with that okay so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m11s)

[that handles zaml Styler that handles](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m13s)

[that we've got a build kind of cruising](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m16s)

[in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m18s)

[progress um let me back this guy up so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m20s)

[we could keep an eye on him and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m23s)

[then what we want to attack next on this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m26s)

[template cuz this has already got a lot](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m29s)

[in here do we deal with things like EF](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m31s)

[and HTTP client that might not be bad](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m36s)

[trying to think what is the stupidest](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m41s)

[simple HTTP client implementation I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m44s)

[could do what's more interesting is the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m47s)

[tests with HTTP client](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m50s)

[how do we do a reasonable](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m56s)

[test what's the best way to go about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h30m59s)

[doing that I'm also wondering about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m01s)

[doing something with like dialogues with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m03s)

[material design and ammo because I'm not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m05s)

[really showing any of that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m07s)

[off](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m09s)

[um because I have a list on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m11s)

[my on the net templates repo I have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m16s)

[like i' I I it'd be nice to show some ma](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m22s)

[apps](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m25s)

[integration and it would be nice to have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m26s)

[different Navigation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m29s)

[strategy um and then EF thing so we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m31s)

[could show some navigation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m36s)

[strategies and by navigation strategies](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m41s)

[this is kind of like how do you want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m44s)

[lay out your app do you want multiple](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m45s)

[windows do you want like a navigation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m50s)

[rail structure do you want like a a tab](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m52s)

[structure do you want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h31m55s)

[a uh do you want like a flow document](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h32m00s)

[thing I almost](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h32m04s)

[wonder maybe we look at something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h32m06s)

[that because that that that's not a bad](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h32m10s)

[idea to go down and it shows off some of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h32m13s)

[slash uh coverage slash TR](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m37s)

[number and then do you have the value](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m50s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m52s)

[you maybe we just do this uh give me](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m53s)

[access with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m58s)

[code yeah so we're going to do let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h34m59s)

[just do that that's that's much](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m01s)

[simpler okay so let's go back to our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m06s)

[template and build app the whole point](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m11s)

[is we just want to write out this PR](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m35s)

[um yeah we'll do that we'll do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m43s)

[we'll do that save then we come over](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m45s)

[here we go make me a new](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m48s)

[go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m56s)

[reapply we check it here and go secrets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h35m59s)

[are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m03s)

[fine we don't want this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m04s)

[file uh we do want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m10s)

[this and then we fire that off and see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m15s)

[what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m18s)

[happens](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m20s)

[okay so once again I'm going to just pop](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m22s)

[this open pop the action open and set it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m24s)

[to the side for the moment I can keep an](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m27s)

[eye on it and let's look at some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m30s)

[building out some different options so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m32s)

[reload okay so common pattern](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m35s)

[that that I see for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m40s)

[navigation uh I guess we could do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m43s)

[navigation rail](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m46s)

[tabbed which are kind of s similar if](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m49s)

[you're aware that underlying both is the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m51s)

[tab control and then we could do like a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m53s)

[a hamburger menu fly out type situation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h36m56s)

[I think that's pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m00s)

[good we're going to get quickly get into](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m02s)

[a case with user controls and I might](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m04s)

[have to go steal Nicolai Source](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m06s)

[generator because it's kind of cool um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m09s)

[for the DI stuff but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m11s)

[let's let's start doing that cuz the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m14s)

[only other thing that's not really in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m17s)

[here is any sort of like Nam space](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m18s)

[setting up because you really don't want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m20s)

[to in a in a real application just kind](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m23s)

[of jumble everything together in one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m26s)

[name space like this the problem is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m27s)

[we're then going to have to make a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m30s)

[really hard determination so the two](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m31s)

[common ways of doing it is some people](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m34s)

[group more by type where you'll see like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m36s)

[a views name space and a view models](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m38s)

[name space um and usually the two kind](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m40s)

[of mirror each](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m42s)

[other the other one which is kind of my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m44s)

[my current preference is you Group by by](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m46s)

[feature or location which works really](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m49s)

[well um it does beg some questions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m52s)

[around where do you put cross cutting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m56s)

[things um It ultimately it comes down to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h37m58s)

[if you can do a good job of naming](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m02s)

[you're fine you're fine it's great but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m04s)

[obviously naming things is one of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m08s)

[two things that's hard in computer](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m09s)

[science the other uh being uh cash and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m11s)

[validation and then off by one errors of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m14s)

[course](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m17s)

[so let's just build this out real quick](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m20s)

[and see see where we land um let me grab](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m23s)

[the material design demo app really](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m26s)

[quick so for those people unfamiliar](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m28s)

[with it uh if you go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m31s)

[to let's see here uh come back uh the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m35s)

[material design project if you go here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m39s)

[you go releases and grab whatever the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m43s)

[latest is you can come down here and you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m45s)

[hit demo app boom get yourself a demo](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m47s)

[app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m50s)

[come on scan it convince yourself that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m54s)

[there's no viruses there we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m56s)

[go okay and then I'm just going to when](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h38m58s)

[you get inside of it I'll warn you there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m01s)

[are a whole bunch of versions generally](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m02s)

[you probably just want the latest](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m05s)

[probably don't need to be cashing so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m07s)

[many but whatever um I figured I'd cash](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m08s)

[them all boom okay and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m11s)

[then I'm going to pull out the Net 7 one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m14s)

[and then you just execute the exe inside](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m17s)

[of it and then you convince it that yes](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m18s)

[I understand you're unsigned run](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m22s)

[anyway okay so this is kind of one of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m24s)

[the the logical ways of handling things](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m28s)

[with this drawer drawer style](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m30s)

[layout um it's probably not a bad one to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m34s)

[go through and build up the basic](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m36s)

[premise is you usually have this kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m39s)

[header bar along the top you've got this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m40s)

[kind of thing that pulls in and out and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m43s)

[then you can kind of build that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m45s)

[out yeah let's see what that looks like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m48s)

[uh okay so in order to get something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m53s)

[like this let's grab the kind of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h39m56s)

[main window layout from the the demo app](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m00s)

[and we're going to kind of mirror some](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m03s)

[of that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m04s)

[stuff uh let's see main](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m06s)

[window yeah so this is where a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m12s)

[the the stuff is going to come so this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m15s)

[drawer host is going to be the key one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m17s)

[here it's going to be bound around to in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m19s)

[this case it's being bound to the toggle](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m22s)

[button we'll see if that's actually what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m24s)

[we want to do but this will get us this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m25s)

[will get us a long way](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m29s)

[there just start with something of that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m30s)

[nature and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m34s)

[then our build](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m35s)

[passed](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m38s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m43s)

[nice and then did it trigger a no this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m46s)

[didn't work Grumble Grumble Grumble uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m51s)

[okay either message or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m55s)

[path input is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h40m59s)

[required uh we said path summary](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m03s)

[GitHub uh download](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m06s)

[artifacts so it downloaded the artifacts](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m09s)

[but it didn't get it either didn't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m12s)

[uh P the pr number appropriately or](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m16s)

[didn't get something so let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m19s)

[uh look at the the other run and look at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m22s)

[its](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m25s)

[artifacts this guy should be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m27s)

[here so this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m32s)

[guy pulled the code](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m35s)

[coverage so that will exist but the what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m37s)

[is missing then is the actual summary](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m42s)

[report that did not get bundled up let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m45s)

[figure out what we did wrong there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m48s)

[upload code coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m50s)

[report uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m52s)

[here so we missed something I'm willing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h41m58s)

[to bet we just botched a a path coverage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m01s)

[report ah because this says Target](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m11s)

[directory is coverage report and we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m14s)

[actually want the target directory to be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m16s)

[here so this got put in the wrong](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m19s)

[directory that's what did](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m21s)

[it once again rinse](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m25s)

[repeat we come](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m31s)

[here check this we go here we go that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m34s)

[what we want I don't care about you](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m38s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m40s)

[and uh fix code](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m42s)

[coverage then we push it because we want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m48s)

[to see see that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m50s)

[coverage task finish okay back to where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m51s)

[we were going reload yeah yeah yeah okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m55s)

[so if we were to redo this main](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h42m58s)

[window uh we would want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m01s)

[have the root level probably to be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m05s)

[something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m08s)

[like probably be something more like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m11s)

[this and then this means the closing is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m14s)

[that okay okay and then we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m19s)

[to yeah cuz we're not going to have the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m25s)

[grid we're not going to have the menu we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m27s)

[may end up keeping the stack panel just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m28s)

[for uh demonstration purposes because](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m32s)

[that's probably awhile thing to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m34s)

[do but we're going to move it up inside](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h43m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h46m49s)

[kind of want to scope it a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h46m52s)

[lower uh like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h46m55s)

[with and throw this away and say](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m27s)

[something along the lines of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m29s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m33s)

[setting missions and this we will see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m37s)

[what this does because I have a strange](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m42s)

[suspicion if I remember right that there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m45s)

[is going to be be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m49s)

[a approval or similar that needs to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m52s)

[in there is a setting you can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h47m56s)

[toggle that will go through and do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m04s)

[this I'm trying to remember where it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m14s)

[is uh require approval D du oh I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m18s)

[this is likely what I have turned on on](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m24s)

[the other repository which is probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m26s)

[why the other one doesn't have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m29s)

[it um but let's just confirm that real](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m32s)

[quick I I suspect that that's what I've](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m35s)

[done actions](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m37s)

[General read and write permissions so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m41s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m44s)

[why the pointer star one doesn't have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m45s)

[right is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m55s)

[do you need to add the permission for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h48m58s)

[this tool pull request](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m01s)

[uh yeah keep more than one comment](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m13s)

[append yeah and again this is a template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m15s)

[so you can change up and leverage these](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m18s)

[however you'd like uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m20s)

[so this is probably going to fail](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m38s)

[again](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h49m41s)

[um yeah we're going to get rid of all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h56m42s)

[actually want to do is something more](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m18s)

[like a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m20s)

[style uh static](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m23s)

[we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m28s)

[want let's do headline](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m33s)

[one so if we look at the demo app we can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m40s)

[go to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m43s)

[typography we can take a look at the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m45s)

[different ones here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m47s)

[surprised so that this one this font](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m55s)

[size is mucking with me a little bit so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m58s)

[we're going to turn that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h57m59s)

[off um and then I think we're probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m01s)

[looking let's do headline](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m06s)

[four if we do material design headline](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m11s)

[that's a little big](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m18s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m19s)

[five yeah that looks better we'll do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m25s)

[something about like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m28s)

[that I think that gets that gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m35s)

[something because I think this is kind](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m37s)

[of what people are looking for to get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m39s)

[this kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m42s)

[interaction](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m48s)

[uh let's turn those](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m51s)

[off that's default so we'll turn that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m55s)

[off we're going to clean up a lot of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h58m58s)

[stuff in here uh what other errors do we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m00s)

[have we're going to need to deal with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m05s)

[the bindings and the setup for the for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m07s)

[all the items in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m10s)

[a got a sidebar there's a search thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m20s)

[in here I don't know if we actually care](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m23s)

[for the search I think we want to get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m25s)

[rid of the search and I think we want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m27s)

[have just a straight list in here so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m29s)

[let's get rid of that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m32s)

[entirely because we want to have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m35s)

[something that's useful but not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m36s)

[overwhelming to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m38s)

[people um this gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m40s)

[us and we still have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m44s)

[this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m48s)

[and I think what we'll go we'll do is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m49s)

[we'll put in uh you know count and about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m51s)

[maybe and do something like that just so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m55s)

[we can show](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m58s)

[navigation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=01h59m59s)

[um maybe home and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m03s)

[about uh you know if we do that we don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m06s)

[even need to data binding do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m09s)

[we see this is where it gets interesting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m13s)

[because now I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m15s)

[curious what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m17s)

[how important are various things to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m21s)

[people](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m24s)

[uh we might not set this minwidth](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m27s)

[so big we might set this down to like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m30s)

[100 that look like it's a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m34s)

[small let's go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m38s)

[150 it's probably okay um and then I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m45s)

[realizing we should probably keep our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m49s)

[our minimum size of our app in general](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m51s)

[you you want to set a Min width and Min](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m54s)

[height on your windows because there's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m56s)

[almost assuredly a a size at which your](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h00m59s)

[unusable](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m05s)

[so that's not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m07s)

[bad like we could probably even let the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m09s)

[width go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m12s)

[smaller CU we want we don't want to be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m15s)

[unreasonably restrictive to the users](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m17s)

[but we also there's a point where it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m19s)

[just doesn't make any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m21s)

[sense that's probably okay that's not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m23s)

[bad okay so we'll we'll do that we'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m27s)

[set a minwidth Min height on each of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m29s)

[the oh so that that passed but it didn't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m36s)

[uh it wasn't a PR comment or commit so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m43s)

[we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h01m47s)

[then](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m04s)

[uh stage this line that means it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m06s)

[literally looks like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m11s)

[just so we can see the again I want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m27s)

[um I'm wondering if the title of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m34s)

[window should also be WPF app so that it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m37s)

[ends up getting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m40s)

[replaced because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m42s)

[we're going to copy this back into our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m44s)

[base template and change this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m46s)

[um so I think if we do this this would](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m49s)

[end up becoming test which I think is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m53s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m55s)

[better](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h02m56s)

[um this is kind of worthless so then the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m02s)

[question is what do we want to do on The](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m05s)

[have effectively two pages the our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m15s)

[our and our about page for example I'm](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m24s)

[thinking I think we do home and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m27s)

[about and we can kind of cheat and like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m30s)

[we can we can scratch this whole thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m33s)

[in here and just throw all this away um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m36s)

[and then we don't even need this right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m38s)

[all of this goes away none of this none](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m40s)

[of this is needed and we can come in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m43s)

[here and we can throw away this whole](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m44s)

[thing and we can do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m47s)

[list box](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m49s)

[stack panel orientation horizontal we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m54s)

[can do something like a uh material](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h03m58s)

[design pack icon and we can do kind and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m02s)

[we can do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m06s)

[home right we can do something like that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m07s)

[get a mildly decent looking item here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m23s)

[fairly quickly if we go here and take a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m26s)

[look the thing is people want to see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m30s)

[clicking on this doing something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m33s)

[right and what does that end up looking](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m36s)

[like I'm also surprised I'm not](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m39s)

[getting oh I don't have it set up to do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m44s)

[the color](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h04m50s)

[it has](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m03s)

[tweaked the the colors in my theme so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m04s)

[they aren't exactly](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m08s)

[purple they're a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m10s)

[off so the question is do do you want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m13s)

[have something maintaining the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m16s)

[have in here before we had a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h05m52s)

[just grab that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m00s)

[binding and do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m01s)

[there because now we should have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m06s)

[a way to reset our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m09s)

[do is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m18s)

[let's let's show off one kind of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h06m20s)

[reset we're after the races should we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m23s)

[show an observable collection we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m25s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m27s)

[should probably should I'm just trying](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m28s)

[to decide if doing the navigation inside](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m31s)

[of main window view model is the right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m35s)

[place to do this or if we want to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m37s)

[actually separate this out a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m39s)

[bit I like the doc shown because we can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m42s)

[get away with doing the navigation like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m45s)

[this and just literally slap lapping in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m47s)

[um a couple list box items right so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m49s)

[something like this works we can come](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m52s)

[over here and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m54s)

[go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m56s)

[about and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h07m59s)

[then we've got both of those in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m02s)

[there I mean it's quick it's easy it's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m05s)

[probably not what people want to see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m09s)

[though and we want to we want to trigger](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m10s)

[some navigation when this when this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m12s)

[occurs](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m17s)

[and I'm almost wondering if the reset](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m23s)

[button should](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m25s)

[uh little over here or not I I can't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m28s)

[decide because the resets going to look](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m31s)

[a little weird on the about screen once](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m32s)

[we swap out because the the idea will be](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m34s)

[that we want the the content here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m37s)

[swapping out which I think is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m40s)

[result in something slightly different](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m42s)

[cuz we're going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m44s)

[something like uh user control](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m46s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m50s)

[um what do we call this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m52s)

[uh uh count](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m56s)

[page count view let's do count](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h08m59s)

[view](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m04s)

[uh and then we'll end up creating like a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m06s)

[count view model to go with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m08s)

[it so we're going to file scope the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m11s)

[namespace Drop the Base Class off just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m15s)

[so that when we clear the name spaces it](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m17s)

[drops down away we go boom um and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m19s)

[then I think we want to set something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m24s)

[like that up and I'm kind of thinking](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m26s)

[that this will be the style we go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m28s)

[for uh let's](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m31s)

[seees to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m35s)

[build uh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you're](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m40s)

[just so](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m43s)

[picky](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m47s)

[got to look the resulting](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h09m56s)

[file uh edit and working](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m03s)

[directory what screw it we can probably](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m07s)

[just bring in the whole](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m09s)

[header](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m11s)

[stage just do this whole thing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m15s)

[stage](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m19s)

[selection](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m25s)

[yeah kind of stupid because we don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m29s)

[really need to do any of this because I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m31s)

[am just trying to kick a PR I don't](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m33s)

[care should have just done like a white](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m35s)

[space change and made my life easy but](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m38s)

[I'm too stupid to do that okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m39s)

[so yeah so let's let's kind of carry](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m44s)

[down this way while we wait for that to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m46s)

[go so so we'll do something like uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m47s)

[public class count view model and there](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m50s)

[is a really good question to be raised](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m53s)

[here about Nam spaces and how to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m55s)

[organize this I haven't haven't really](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m56s)

[decided how I want the sample to do that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h10m59s)

[but we will go with uh observable](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m03s)

[object isn't isn't it observable object](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m07s)

[or observable yeah observable object](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m10s)

[that's what I want let's do what I say](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m12s)

[and then I want you to be partial which](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m15s)

[is CR rticle here and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m17s)

[is actually going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m21s)

[take pretty much all of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m23s)

[this put it in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m29s)

[here um we don't care about the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m31s)

[Constructor for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m35s)

[moment we'll do](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m38s)

[this and then the count view is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m43s)

[more or less take](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m47s)

[this whole](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m50s)

[thing we're going to put that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m52s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h11m57s)

[thank uh let's see format zaml then we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m00s)

[want to set the design time data context](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m04s)

[so we get good](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m06s)

[usage uh let's see](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m09s)

[uh design instance](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m13s)

[type uh count view](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m16s)

[model uh let's see let's do that what](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m19s)

[did what was the name s we did over here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m23s)

[for it we did](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m25s)

[local okay fine we can we can stick with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m29s)

[local for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m32s)

[moment local and that's only working](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m35s)

[because these things are at the root](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m38s)

[once we once we Nest these things in any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m40s)

[other Nam space we're going to have to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m42s)

[add like another XML Nam space for any](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m45s)

[of this to to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m47s)

[fly okay so this gets us here this gets](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m51s)

[us](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h12m54s)

[here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m01s)

[yeah and then let's go ahead and do uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m09s)

[add user control we'll do something like](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m14s)

[about View](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m17s)

[you right we'll clean this guy up as](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m19s)

[well uh file scope the Nam space clean](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m23s)

[that up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m27s)

[great um and](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m29s)

[then I think for the moment we're just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m31s)

[going to go with uh text block text too](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m34s)

[all right this is going to need](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m38s)

[something sorry email notification just](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m41s)

[popped oh look at that look at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m46s)

[that that's what I'm talking about right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m53s)

[that's what we were going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m56s)

[foro okay so that is now all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h13m59s)

[working okay so that now that that is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m06s)

[working let's go back to our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m09s)

[template uh let's see we're going to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m11s)

[here create Branch here and we're going](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m14s)

[to do something like like uh adding](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m16s)

[GitHub](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m20s)

[actions come in here and let's check](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m21s)

[everything so we](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m23s)

[want this stuff that makes sense we want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m25s)

[the code coverage report which makes](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m30s)

[sense uh let's see hold on we did add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m34s)

[the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m42s)

[uh we want to kind of clean up the text](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m45s)

[on that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m48s)

[message um to allow](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m49s)

[workflows](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m53s)

[uh I was going to just site this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h14m56s)

[page because their their description is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m00s)

[pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m08s)

[uh just grab that little bit for the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m10s)

[moment uh](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m16s)

[you must](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m19s)

[enable read write permissions to allow](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m22s)

[workflow uh to create comments](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m26s)

[on on the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m32s)

[pr repo navigate](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m38s)

[to okay so we're going to do that I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m45s)

[think because I think that's a little](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m48s)

[easier to track stage that we don't want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m49s)

[any of that we do want that we do want](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m53s)

[the zaml styler and we want all of this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h15m56s)

[yeah look at](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m00s)

[that oh that's adding it never mind](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m01s)

[never](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m04s)

[mind okay we're going to put that back](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m06s)

[in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m08s)

[place okay](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m09s)

[adding oy to the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m12s)

[template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m16s)

[and then if people are interested in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m20s)

[seeing I'd be curious what people are](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m23s)

[interested in seen for how to deploy the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m25s)

[WPF app and this is where it gets hard](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m27s)

[to know what to put in a template](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m29s)

[because there's a lot of different ways](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m31s)

[of doing](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m33s)

[it something like Cloud srel would Pro](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m34s)

[or scir day would be probably my](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m38s)

[preference but I could see somebody](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m40s)

[wanting like msix or similar and that](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m41s)

[that kind of gets us down a different](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m44s)

[Rabbit Hole of how do we modernize our](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m46s)

[WPF with the latest uh Windows sdks](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m49s)

[which that might be interesting to add](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m52s)

[as well there's so much there's so much](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m54s)

[you can you can easily tack into here](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m56s)

[but I think having something like this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h16m58s)

[set up is going to get us a long](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m00s)

[way okay I am probably going to end up](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m03s)

[playing with this this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m06s)

[layout um I think I want to spend a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m10s)

[little time thinking about the proper](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m12s)

[way to do navigation this does this does](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m13s)

[get to be a little bit interesting um](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m17s)

[and I brought it up in my dependency](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m19s)

[injection video is when you have](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m22s)

[something like this view](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m24s)

[object you're limited to a default](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m27s)

[Constructor because in order to launch](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m31s)

[this the um the Lo the creation of the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m34s)

[view isn't something that you can](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m38s)

[realistically feed into your um di](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m40s)

[container especially if you've got](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m45s)

[uh something over here because ideally](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m48s)

[what we'd like to do is we'd like to get](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m50s)

[rid of this completely and go with](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m51s)

[something like local count view right](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m54s)

[which which works and we still get the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h17m59s)

[same view but the problem is is in order](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m02s)

[for this line to exist we have to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m04s)

[basically be able to have a um a default](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m07s)

[Constructor to be able to be done which](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m11s)

[makes doing the DI a little bit](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m13s)

[obnoxious because in an ideal situation](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m15s)

[we would much rather have something more](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m17s)

[akin to how we did the main window where](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m19s)

[you have a view model being passed in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m21s)

[and there's a](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m24s)

[couple kind of tricky workarounds for](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m26s)

[this um Nikolai actually has a pretty](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m29s)

[cool Source generator that he was](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m31s)

[looking at doing at one point so I might](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m33s)

[I may poke at that and and see about](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m36s)

[bringing it into the template because I](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m38s)

[I do like having navigation I am](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m40s)

[wondering if this template is going to](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m43s)

[need to add in extra bits](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m45s)

[because the other thing is dialogue](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m48s)

[host is generally inside your view](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m50s)

[models you're going to want something](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m52s)

[that shows a dialogue which means](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m53s)

[putting a dialog host over the top of](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m55s)

[this so I might look at adding that in](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h18m57s)

[I'm what I think I'm going to do is](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m01s)

[probably have like a switch on the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m03s)

[template that's something like simple](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m06s)

[view that way people who don't want all](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m08s)

[this can kind of turn it off and I'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m10s)

[basically have two main window. zamal](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m12s)

[and just feature flag a bunch of files](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m14s)

[in or out depending on where that's set](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m16s)

[that way we can have one the the default](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m19s)

[mode of the template will be all the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m21s)

[things and just like how the other one](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m25s)

[ones have extra stuff we will there'll](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m28s)

[be a switch to turn it off I think](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m30s)

[that's probably the route to go](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m31s)

[down I think I'm going to play with this](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m34s)

[merge and squash and then I think in the](https://youtu.be/aXSGfzyEx_M?t=02h19m45s)
