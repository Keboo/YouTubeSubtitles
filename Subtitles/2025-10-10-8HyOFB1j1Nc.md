[Hello everyone. Welcome back. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m01s)

[tonight, uh I figured I would dive in.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m04s)

[There was a request last time for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m06s)

[actually making a video going through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m08s)

[some of my .NET templates. And I've](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m10s)

[actually been spending some time the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m12s)

[last couple weeks trying to update and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m13s)

[improve some of the .NET templates and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m16s)

[adding some more features to them. So, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m18s)

[figured we would dive in and take a look](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m20s)

[at that. There's also a couple material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m21s)

[design ones. Uh, but for anybody not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m23s)

[paying attention to the Discord for it,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m26s)

[Material Design 530 is released and out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m28s)

[the door. So 531 will probably be on its](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m31s)

[heels. I usually expect that every](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m34s)

[release there's some number of bugs that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m36s)

[just crop up from new things, people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m38s)

[testing, that sort of thing. So I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m41s)

[anticipating that. Um, I was really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m43s)

[happy to see that my pipeline almost](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m45s)

[worked this time. I was very close. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m47s)

[the very last step that actually commits](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m50s)

[back a version number update that ended](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m52s)

[up failing, but I just did it manually,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m54s)

[called it a day, and it worked great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m56s)

[Um, at least I think it worked great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h00m59s)

[Let's go check on that. But we'll check](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m01s)

[on that in just a minute. First,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m03s)

[something exciting. Okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m04s)

[Uh, this week, Git Kraken released 1150.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m08s)

[And this one just made me very, very,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m11s)

[very excited. Um, specifically, there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m14s)

[not a ton of stuff in here in terms of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m17s)

[like new features. There's some access](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m20s)

[to different models. You can do some AI](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m21s)

[pickers. We'll look at that in a second.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m23s)

[But this this right here, right, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m25s)

[what got me very very very excited, is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m28s)

[huge, huge performance increases. I've](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m33s)

[been using this all week on some repos](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m36s)

[that are large and notoriously](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m38s)

[problematic for being a little laggy and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m40s)

[slow, and there is a noticeable](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m42s)

[increase. If you weren't noticing speed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m44s)

[performances before, you might not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m46s)

[notice anything. Smaller repos, some of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m48s)

[those, whatever, right? There's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m50s)

[handful of things that just feel a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m51s)

[little smoother and faster, maybe not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m53s)

[overly noticeable. For bigger repos,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m55s)

[lots of branches, lots of tags, lots of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m57s)

[commits. Yeah, this is noticeably faster](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h01m59s)

[and better. Huge props to the team for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m02s)

[this. Absolutely love it. Uh, a couple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m05s)

[other ones that I will go through and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m08s)

[show. And again, I'm uh let me just move](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m10s)

[myself to the side. I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m12s)

[point out one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m13s)

[uh one little thing here is I am on an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m15s)

[enterprise skew. So if you don't see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m18s)

[this on yours, it might be a a skew](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m21s)

[thing u because I don't always check it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m23s)

[where the the break points is. But on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m26s)

[the the AI integration, assuming you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m28s)

[have a high enough skew for it, you do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m30s)

[have model selection. Um I've actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m32s)

[been jumping up to the flash preview and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m35s)

[getting a lot better results. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m38s)

[I'm gonna change all of my defaults off](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m41s)

[of here onto the 25 flash because it is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m43s)

[it's been working a lot better for me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m47s)

[Yes, I love a performance release. 100%,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m49s)

[Kenny. 100%. Um, it like everything just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m51s)

[feels snappier to me, which has been](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m55s)

[absolutely amazing. Love every bit of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h02m59s)

[it. Um, there's also a handful of small](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m02s)

[bugs with 11.4. there was uh an issue](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m04s)

[where if you were interacting with your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m07s)

[git repository outside of the the commit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m09s)

[graph like either from the even from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m13s)

[within the terminal inside of git kraken](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m14s)

[or some other outside tool the amount of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m16s)

[time it would take for the graph to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m18s)

[update and refresh was like 30 to 60](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m20s)

[seconds at times it was dog slow now](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m23s)

[snappy snappy snappy um it's still not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m27s)

[like instantaneous but I mean you've got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m31s)

[some outside process mcking with your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m33s)

[git repos ostory. What do you expect?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m35s)

[Um, but much better, significantly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m37s)

[nicer.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m41s)

[Okay, with that, we're going to take a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m43s)

[quick gander down my net templates and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m46s)

[we're going to we're going to look at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m49s)

[some of these and then um we will go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m50s)

[through and play with them. So, for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m53s)

[people who are unaware uh net we have a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m55s)

[template in Jin called net new is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m57s)

[oftentimes how it gets referred to um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h03m59s)

[but it is net templates. There's a a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m01s)

[link here and if anybody wants to play](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m04s)

[along at home, here's my here's my repo.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m06s)

[Um, and I will say and this is the docs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m08s)

[for doing your own templates or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m11s)

[installing them and that kind of thing,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m13s)

[but we'll cover that. Um, this bit here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m14s)

[uh walks you through what it takes to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m18s)

[install it. It assumes that you have the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m20s)

[.NET SDK already installed. Um, because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m22s)

[if you're looking to use my templates,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m25s)

[they're all .NET templates. Um, you are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m26s)

[not limited to .NET templates. It's just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m28s)

[this is what it is designed for. But you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m30s)

[can technically net new any file type.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m32s)

[It's an arbitrary templating engine for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m34s)

[you. It's just some of the extra](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m36s)

[functions are built around doing nety](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m38s)

[things so you get used to it. So net new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m40s)

[will install the templates and you'll be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m44s)

[off to the races. If you decide you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m46s)

[done with them, there's your uninstall](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m47s)

[command. Um and then if you already have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m49s)

[a version of mine, be aware I've been](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m51s)

[pushing updates, so expect to see some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m53s)

[revs to these. Um there is a net new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h04m55s)

[update. the way I have been trying to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m00s)

[version these and this is again one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m02s)

[those things where semantic versioning](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m04s)

[gets weird because what is considered a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m06s)

[breaking change right um and the way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m09s)

[I've been doing it is if the CLI for the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m12s)

[arguments that you pass to net new is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m16s)

[breaking change then I'll rev my major](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m18s)

[version if it's just a bug fix with no](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m21s)

[impact to the CLI I' uh patch version if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m24s)

[there is a backwards compatible CLI](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m28s)

[change like I add more options or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m30s)

[something. That's a minor version ref.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m31s)

[So that's the way I've been trying to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m33s)

[version it. I don't think that there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m34s)

[widespread support for what or how to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m37s)

[version templates. Um it's kind of left](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m40s)

[up to you. The other thing to note is if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m42s)

[you've already started a project,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m45s)

[my templates are built to be solution](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m48s)

[level full whole thing, right? Um there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m51s)

[is technically a switch we'll look at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m54s)

[where you could do just a project for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m56s)

[some of them. Um, but they really are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m57s)

[designed to be full solution and they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h05m59s)

[are set up the way I like to start](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m01s)

[projects. So, it's all about this is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m03s)

[way I like to build them. So, there is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m05s)

[lot of heavy opinion here. Um, but take](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m07s)

[what you like, right? In some cases,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m10s)

[I've put in switches for people to turn](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m12s)

[things on and off because sometimes I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m13s)

[don't want all my things. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m15s)

[sometimes I do. Um, so again, heavy](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m17s)

[opinion, but if you're wondering how I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m20s)

[like to build stuff, this is the example](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m21s)

[of how I like to build things. So, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m23s)

[currently have a WPF one. uh one for if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m25s)

[you're wanting to build a Nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m28s)

[package, one if you're wanting to build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m29s)

[a command line application, and then one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m31s)

[for Avalonia. The Avalonia one we may](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m33s)

[spend a little time working on. There's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m35s)

[a a future Avalonia app in my future](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m37s)

[that is coming, which is kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m40s)

[exciting. Um I won't spoil it yet](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m42s)

[because we haven't really started it,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m44s)

[but it's coming and it's going to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m46s)

[cool. Um but there's like a long lag](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m47s)

[time for it due date, so but I got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m51s)

[permission to poke at it on stream. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m53s)

[once we get it going, we'll probably do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m55s)

[it on stream. We may bring in some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m57s)

[friends to work on it, too. It'll be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h06m58s)

[great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m00s)

[Okay. So, for this, if we've already](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m02s)

[installed the templates, and let me grab](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m04s)

[uh my install command because I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m07s)

[think I have it in because I I was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m10s)

[testing locally. So, I think I I blasted](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m12s)

[my stuff away. So, I'm going to install](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m14s)

[my templates.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m17s)

[And so, after installing, I can see that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m19s)

[I've got all four of my templates. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m21s)

[these short names here are the key ones](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m24s)

[that you want to look for. So, at time](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m26s)

[of recording, 190 is my latest release.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m27s)

[You can see the languages here are all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m30s)

[C. And then I've got some a handful of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m32s)

[tags for what I I think makes reasonable](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m35s)

[sense for this. But for here, we are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m37s)

[going to focus on the full WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m39s)

[application just to to be able to show](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m41s)

[this. Um, okay. So, I'm going to back](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m43s)

[up. I'm going to go mkur uh WPF sample.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m45s)

[Oh, you that's not how you do the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m51s)

[command.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m53s)

[WPF sample cd WPF sample. There we go.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h07m55s)

[Boom. Okay, clear that out. So, the way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m00s)

[you end up doing this and we will we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m04s)

[will drop in here. We'll go to the WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m06s)

[solution one. Um, I have tried to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m08s)

[through and keep my readme mildly up to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m11s)

[date with some of the interesting stuff](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m14s)

[that is on here. One of the more recent](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m16s)

[changes that I have added in has been a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m19s)

[pipeline option. So if you want full](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m21s)

[CI/CD pre-gened for you, there is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m23s)

[GitHub and an Azure DevOps option. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m27s)

[the Azure DevOps one I have not fully](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m31s)

[tested, but it looks correct. So if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m33s)

[run into issues with my templates,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m35s)

[please just let me know. The other one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m36s)

[is I have updated to using SLNX. So this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m38s)

[is a new solution file format. Um, where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m42s)

[is do I have the docs in here? Pipeline.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m46s)

[Yeah. So, the the solution file format,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m50s)

[the SLNX, this is a new format um for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m53s)

[doing solution files for Microsoft. Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m56s)

[that that's not the link I want to show.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h08m59s)

[I think the blog shows it off better.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m01s)

[Um, but this is kind of what an old](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m04s)

[solution file would look like to you.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m07s)

[It's kind of ugly. Um, and it gets worse](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m09s)

[when you start adding stuff in. you get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m11s)

[gooids everywhere and this is a living](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m13s)

[nightmare for merge conflicts. The new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m15s)

[solution format is XMLbased and it's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m18s)

[pretty and it's normal and it's nice.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m21s)

[This is SLNX is what the uh is roughly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m24s)

[the solution equivalent for the project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m29s)

[SDK format that Microsoft introduced](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m32s)

[which is great right there are a handful](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m34s)

[of minor issues still out there with it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m37s)

[like there's a couple open issues on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m39s)

[net new template for some of their like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m41s)

[um after build commands where it's not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m44s)

[properly added but for the most part](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m46s)

[everything has support for this writer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m48s)

[supports it VS Code Devkit um Visual](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m50s)

[Studio supports it. You do need to be on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m53s)

[a mildly recent edition of VS 2022. If](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h09m56s)

[you're on something that's like 6 months](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m00s)

[old or older, you might have to go in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m01s)

[and there's a preview flag you have to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m03s)

[turn on for to get SLNX support or like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m05s)

[I said, if you're on a modernish release](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m08s)

[of it, you're fine. It just works. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m10s)

[and then the only other thing to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m13s)

[aware of is your build SDK has to be at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m14s)

[least I think 9.0.202](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m18s)

[I think is what it is. I think it was in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m20s)

[here, uh, 9.0.200.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m23s)

[So, this isn't your target framework.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m25s)

[You can still target an older framework,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m27s)

[but the version of the SDK that you have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m29s)

[installed, the one that's actually going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m32s)

[to be running build and whatnot, has to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m33s)

[be at least 9.0.200.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m35s)

[So, more than likely what happens is if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m38s)

[somebody has like a global.json that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m40s)

[pinning them to say net 8 or something](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m42s)

[weird, right, this will end up failing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m44s)

[because net 8 SDK doesn't know anything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m47s)

[about SLNX. you got to be on something](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m49s)

[mildly newer. But for most people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m51s)

[starting a project with a net new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m53s)

[template, I think it's fair game to say](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m54s)

[the new solution format is probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m57s)

[reasonable. If you want the old one, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h10m59s)

[did leave a switch in place, at least](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m00s)

[for now. I'll probably kill it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m02s)

[eventually. Um, but if you want to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m04s)

[back and use the old one, you can do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m06s)

[dash um sln. So there's there's some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m07s)

[kind of samples there of what you want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m11s)

[to do. And we are going to go through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m13s)

[here and we are just going to run the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m15s)

[net new command to start it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m17s)

[So, and I believe you can do this to get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m20s)

[actually all of the the help out of it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m24s)

[to to see what is possibly in there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m26s)

[It's worth noting there are template](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m29s)

[options which are the ones that I define](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m31s)

[that my template supports, but then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m34s)

[there's some basic um ones that all net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m36s)

[new templates support. So for example,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m39s)

[these ones here for name um by default](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m42s)

[it just uses the um output being created](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m45s)

[um and it will use your current](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m48s)

[directory. So the fact that I've named](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m50s)

[my current directory WPF sample unless I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m51s)

[specify a name when I'm creating this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m54s)

[template, it's just going to use WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m56s)

[sample. Um and it can show the dry run.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h11m58s)

[Um, and force is the other interesting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m00s)

[thing that gets interesting uh to use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m02s)

[because in the situation where you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m06s)

[like, you know what, I really just want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m08s)

[to apply your latest template over the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m09s)

[top of my existing app and you know,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m11s)

[I'll use git kraken or some other diff](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m13s)

[tool to take out the stuff I don't want.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m15s)

[Um, you can actually run um net new with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m18s)

[a template and go d-force and it will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m22s)

[just run over the top of it. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m24s)

[sometimes I'll do this when I know that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m26s)

[I've updated like say my editor config](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m28s)

[or similar and I'm like I just want the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m30s)

[latest editor config for my template. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m32s)

[will literally just run net new with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m34s)

[force and then revert everything but the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m36s)

[editor config change. So you can do you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m38s)

[can get away stuff like that um to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m40s)

[able to to get away with it, right? And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m43s)

[then different languages, but you know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m45s)

[what? Uh mine only supports C#, so some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m47s)

[of these aren't going to do anything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m50s)

[with my templates. So we're going to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m51s)

[here. We're going to go net new and I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m53s)

[going to take everything, right? And we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m55s)

[will we will walk through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h12m58s)

[um what to expect when you when you fire](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m01s)

[up my template and kind of focus in on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m04s)

[some of these features. So, uh first and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m06s)

[foremost things to to note right out the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m08s)

[gate. There's our solution file um where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m10s)

[it sits. Um and then we're just going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m13s)

[go I think kind of bottom up looking at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m15s)

[this. So, ZAML styler is a Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m17s)

[extension that provides a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m20s)

[formatting options for ZAML files. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m23s)

[inside of WPF, this file does nothing if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m26s)

[you don't have the extension installed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m29s)

[or available. So, just be aware if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m31s)

[aren't using ZAML styler, you don't like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m33s)

[it, you can nuke this file. Totally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m35s)

[fine. You're off to the races. But, if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m37s)

[you want to see the formatting options](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m39s)

[that I like, specifically, I like my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m41s)

[indentation on my ZAML files to be two](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m43s)

[spaces. And I like it to line up my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m46s)

[attributes. Something I can't quite do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m48s)

[in Visual Studio editor config settings.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m50s)

[So having this thing here to actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m52s)

[get that formatting in place is exactly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m54s)

[what I like there. Uh readme is as one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m56s)

[would expect, but let me pop the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h13m59s)

[solution file open and we'll we'll look](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m01s)

[at some of these other ones inside of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m03s)

[Visual Studio. So uh we will come in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m04s)

[here and then so there's the ZAML styler](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m08s)

[settings. You can see a lot of these are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m11s)

[fairly def uh defaulted. I think the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m14s)

[indent size is one of the key ones that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m17s)

[I changed. Um I can't remember that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m19s)

[might even be its default. Okay. Nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m22s)

[config. This is something that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m24s)

[should probably have at the root of your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m26s)

[repository. The key thing here is having](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m28s)

[your project specify what Nougat sources](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m32s)

[it is allowed to use when restoring](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m35s)

[Nougat packages. So in this case, this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m37s)

[probably matches uh this Nougat config](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m40s)

[here probably matches what is in most](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m43s)

[people's default Nougat config at the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m44s)

[user profile level, but there is times](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m47s)

[where you know you've added stuff to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m51s)

[your user profile or otherwise and you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m52s)

[don't necessarily want that propagating](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m54s)

[in. More importantly, as a way of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m56s)

[securing your supply chain, if somebody](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h14m58s)

[were to say compromise a build agent or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m00s)

[similar and muck with the Nougat config](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m02s)

[at the user level out of a build agent,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m05s)

[that would be bad. This clear statement](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m08s)

[here is specifically there to say, okay,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m10s)

[whatever package sources you resolve](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m13s)

[from sources higher up, whack them. This](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m16s)

[is the only one you're allowed to use.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m19s)

[So I put this in in my case because of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m21s)

[my current user config. This isn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m25s)

[changing anything. But hypothetically if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m27s)

[this was on a machine with that had](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m29s)

[another Nougat config higher up or at a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m31s)

[user profile level. This ensures that I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m33s)

[don't accidentally resolve my packages](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m36s)

[from some other source, right? It keeps](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m37s)

[me locked into here and then everything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m40s)

[maps here. It does have a sample down](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m41s)

[here and I tried to do this in a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m44s)

[places of my template is leave commented](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m46s)

[code out for things that people are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m48s)

[likely to do or things that I often](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m51s)

[change. So if you have say an Azure](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m53s)

[DevOps artifacts feed where you might](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h15m56s)

[from as well. This is where you might](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m00s)

[add in those additional sources. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m03s)

[then the key thing here is just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m05s)

[specifying a package pattern for what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m06s)

[matches where. Right? So that is the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m09s)

[over the exclusions dictionary. This is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m16s)

[around the spell checker that's in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m19s)

[Visual Studio. I have had it's it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m20s)

[supposedly fixed. There has been a lot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m23s)

[of bugs with this built-in spell](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m25s)

[the dictionary doesn't have the right](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m30s)

[file encoding or line ending, it doesn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m31s)

[work. And oh, if you add a thing to it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m33s)

[with the, you know, control period in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m35s)

[Visual Studio, it messes up the format.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m37s)

[There there's been a lot of things and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m39s)

[need to go back through and see if it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m40s)

[fixed. All the issues I was tracking](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m42s)

[have now been marked as resolved by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m43s)

[Microsoft. So I think they're all fixed,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m45s)

[but I have not validated them.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m48s)

[Okay, editor config. Kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m50s)

[self-explanatory. This is the editor](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m52s)

[config for um how I like to set up all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m55s)

[of these things. You'll note there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m58s)

[kind of an interesting thing here in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h16m59s)

[that it's showing immediately with a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m01s)

[star. Um, I've been meaning to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m03s)

[through because the editor configured my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m05s)

[template. Um, each version of Visual](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m07s)

[Studio, they sometimes add additional](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m09s)

[options in here. And so, what this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m10s)

[showing me is the fact that I've opened](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m13s)

[it in VS 2026 insiders that there are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m14s)

[new settings that I don't have in my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m19s)

[editor config and the defaults are being](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m21s)

[populated in for me. Convenient. But if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m23s)

[you want to go through and change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m26s)

[anything, have at it, right? You can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m27s)

[also, and I'm going to hit don't save](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m28s)

[here. You can also edit your editor](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m30s)

[config by going open width and just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m32s)

[grabbing like the source code editor.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m34s)

[Double click and you can kind of see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m37s)

[this structure here. If you edit it in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m38s)

[the UI, you don't get this kind of nicer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m40s)

[breakdown](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m44s)

[for file type, right? To see kind of how](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m46s)

[things are supposed to go. Like I've got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m48s)

[my indent level set here as well. um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m50s)

[this doesn't affect like ind uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m54s)

[attributes if you span um an element](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m56s)

[across multiple lines inside of ZAML. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h17m59s)

[that's why this doesn't fully work and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m00s)

[why I still need ZAML styler. But little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m03s)

[things like I'm a space guy rather than](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m05s)

[a tab guy,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m07s)

[right? If you don't like it, change it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m09s)

[Right? Again, this is this is Kevin's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m11s)

[personal preferences of which way he](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m14s)

[wants to go. Okay. We then go into the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m15s)

[directory build props um and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m18s)

[directory build targets. Um and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m21s)

[targets is empty um but it functionally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m23s)

[works the same as the props. And I'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m26s)

[kind of explain here these two files are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m28s)

[magical files that MS build looks for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m31s)

[when compiling your application. So and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m34s)

[I think I put something in here about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m37s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m40s)

[Did I not include anything? Oh, build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m43s)

[customization right here. So, here are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m46s)

[the docs underneath this if you want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m47s)

[dive in more. So, there's your build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m49s)

[props, build targets files, and um the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m51s)

[structure of each of those. So, these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m54s)

[files here get automatically picked up,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m57s)

[get automatically applied to all of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h18m59s)

[projects that are in a folder under](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m02s)

[this. So you can do one of these files](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m04s)

[in a nested level. Like if you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m08s)

[somebody who likes to have like yours](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m09s)

[SRC and and test directories, you could](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m11s)

[put one of these files in your slash](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m14s)

[test directory and it would apply to all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m16s)

[of your test projects. The thing to note](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m18s)

[is when you are compiling, MS build will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m21s)

[only walk up the directory structure](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m23s)

[until it runs into the first one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m25s)

[these files and then it stops. If you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m27s)

[want it to keep going, you need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m30s)

[uncomment this line here. This tells it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m32s)

[to keep going. So of, hey, I know you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m35s)

[found this one, include it. And then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m38s)

[also include the one above it. Then also](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m40s)

[include the one above it. So by default,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m41s)

[you only get that one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m43s)

[But this is also the place where I will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m45s)

[set up my language version. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m47s)

[apparently my lang version probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m49s)

[needs a bit of a bump. Um because 12 is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m50s)

[a little old. We're just going to make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m53s)

[that bigger. And so now I am on lang](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m55s)

[version 13 on all my projects. And I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m57s)

[didn't have to go through all my CS](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h19m59s)

[project files. Um, there is a Visual](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m00s)

[Studio accelerator property that I turn](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m02s)

[on because it often times will get you a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m04s)

[slight bump in compiling speed. Great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m06s)

[Um, I like using implicit using and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m08s)

[noble reference types. I just turn these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m11s)

[things on by default. These are also on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m12s)

[by default in the default.net template.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m15s)

[Another one that I tend to do and again](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m18s)

[this is a bit of preference is if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m20s)

[are using user secrets. Um, most people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m22s)

[aren't familiar with this in WPF, but if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m25s)

[you are doing ASP.NET Core, you will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m28s)

[oftentimes see these things show up as a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m30s)

[way of getting configuration into your I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m32s)

[configuration instance. We'll see it in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m34s)

[WPF in a moment. But what setting this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m36s)

[user secrets ID in a directory build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m39s)

[props does is this allows all of my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m41s)

[projects to have the same user secrets](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m44s)

[file. Because if we go here and we go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m47s)

[where is my manage user secrets? There.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m50s)

[Right? And if I look at this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m52s)

[secrets.json file, you'll note that the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m54s)

[this gooid here, that's the the way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h20m59s)

[secrets work is they are just a JSON](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m03s)

[file in a folder that is not checked](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m05s)

[into your repository. That's it. That's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m09s)

[as secret as they are. So just be aware](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m11s)

[your secrets files are only as secure as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m13s)

[your app data directory is secure.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m16s)

[That's that's the level of security](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m18s)

[we're talking about. but they aren't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m19s)

[checked in which makes them very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m20s)

[convenient at times for plugging in you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m22s)

[know API keys or similar that you don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m25s)

[want to accidentally commit to your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m26s)

[repository but you need for debugging or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m28s)

[otherwise right and often times what I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m30s)

[find is I don't want a separate user](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m33s)

[secrets file for every single project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m35s)

[which if you let it gen normally it will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m38s)

[set this property up on every project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m41s)

[that you add user secrets to but I kind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m43s)

[of want all of mine to share the same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m45s)

[user secrets file now This may not work](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m48s)

[for all projects. It works for mine. If](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m50s)

[you don't like it, again, comment it out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m53s)

[and don't use it. But it's up to you.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m54s)

[This just allows me to have one shared](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m56s)

[user secrets file across all of my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h21m58s)

[projects. Yes, it allows me to inject](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m00s)

[extra secrets across my projects that I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m02s)

[may not have intended, but again, this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m04s)

[is a local file, not something checked](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m07s)

[in for mass configuration. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m09s)

[literally there for me. So, I like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m11s)

[setting it up here in my props file. The](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m14s)

[difference between a props file and a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m17s)

[targets file is when they are invoked.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m19s)

[So if we look at our CS projects here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m22s)

[when you see this SDK attribute up at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m24s)

[the top, secretly what this is doing is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m27s)

[this is bringing in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m29s)

[Microsoft.NET.SDK.props](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m30s)

[at the beginning and it's bringing in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m33s)

[the targets at the end. And that order](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m35s)

[of operations matters because when MS](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m38s)

[build runs um props are something that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m40s)

[gets set up at initially and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m44s)

[targets are things that get brought in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m46s)

[at the very back. So sometimes what will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m49s)

[happen is you'll set something up in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m52s)

[your props but if something in the SDK](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m53s)

[overrides that prop it's no longer there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m56s)

[for you at the end. So occasionally it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h22m59s)

[is where uh you end up needing to put](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m01s)

[things in a targets file because you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m03s)

[want to override something in the SDK](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m05s)

[versus the props file where you need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m07s)

[set it so that it's available for the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m10s)

[SDK. Those are kind of the in general](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m11s)

[where you might do it. So props goes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m14s)

[first, targets goes second. Functionally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m16s)

[they are both just MS build files that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m19s)

[get picked up. There's nothing about a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m21s)

[props file that says you can't have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m23s)

[targets in it. There's nothing about a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m25s)

[targets file that says you can't have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m26s)

[properties in it. Again, it's all about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m28s)

[ordering and they're named to try to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m30s)

[indicate where things probably should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m32s)

[go. Targets generally end up in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m34s)

[targets file because those are things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m37s)

[that are going to run and you probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m38s)

[are chaining them on the end of SDK](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m41s)

[targets rather than setting them up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m44s)

[first where they're going to be blown](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m47s)

[away. So it's things like that where in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m48s)

[general you set properties up so that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m50s)

[they can be consumed by the SDK and you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m53s)

[set targets up um based on or to run](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m54s)

[before or after SDK targets. So you want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h23m59s)

[them coming in after the SDK targets are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m01s)

[added. So this guy is empty because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m03s)

[frankly my my default template doesn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m07s)

[have anything worth adding here. Um but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m09s)

[there is that setup. Okay. So there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m13s)

[the top level solution stuff. Um I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m17s)

[going to point out just a couple things.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m19s)

[So I ran this one by default and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m21s)

[picked up my GitHub pipeline stuff. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m23s)

[this is a little different for DevOps](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m27s)

[because I don't have like the dependabot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m28s)

[for DevOps setup because it's not nearly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m31s)

[as trivial to configure. But for GitHub](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m33s)

[actions, if you if that is where you are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m37s)

[deploying your stuff to, I do set up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m39s)

[Dependabot to run on a weekly basis to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m42s)

[automatically update all of my Nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m44s)

[packages and my GitHub actions. All this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m47s)

[is is Dependabot running, checking to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m49s)

[see if there are updated uh Nougat or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m52s)

[GitHub actions, and if so, it opens up a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m55s)

[pull request to say, "Hey, here's the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h24m57s)

[new version. Go ahead and bring it in."](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m00s)

[The nice part is if you have things set](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m02s)

[up um with good tests and otherwise](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m04s)

[often times you can just take the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m07s)

[package updates, right? Like ask](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m09s)

[yourself if you were to rev that package](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m11s)

[or version locally, what extra testing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m13s)

[would you do that your test suite isn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m16s)

[already covering, right? If the answer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m18s)

[is not much, then yeah, just ship it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m19s)

[So, um I like to have these on by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m23s)

[default. I generally turn it on on all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m25s)

[of mine. Uh unfortunately you also means](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m27s)

[that I usually get spammed by dependabot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m30s)

[once a week which is great especially](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m32s)

[when certain packages push out updates I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m34s)

[just get hammered because you know if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m36s)

[it's like the Microsoft testing SDK I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m39s)

[using that everywhere and so every](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m41s)

[single one of my repos hammers me on it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m44s)

[Okay build app. So this is again one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m47s)

[the ways to do it and there are lots of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m51s)

[debates about where things should go. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m53s)

[have considered switching this over to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m55s)

[doing like um uh git versioning. I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h25m57s)

[can't decide. It's slightly more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m02s)

[complicated but also easier is if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m03s)

[know what's going on. So it's again up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m06s)

[to you. Um I kind of came to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m09s)

[conclusion that the simplest thing to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m11s)

[was to have a 1.0 the GitHub run number](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m13s)

[version. Um and then you manually rev](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m16s)

[this version when you want to bump the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m19s)

[version of your app later. Um, there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m21s)

[a potential problem when you get too](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m24s)

[high of a number here of this third](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m26s)

[digit overflowing and you don't have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m28s)

[space for it. At that point, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m30s)

[probably need to do something different.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m32s)

[Again, it I have mixed feelings. I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m34s)

[quite know how to do this. Um, the key](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m36s)

[things here is it does assume that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m39s)

[have a ma that your your default branch](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m41s)

[is called main. If that's not the case,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m43s)

[if you're on master or similar, change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m45s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m46s)

[But this guy will run on pushes to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m48s)

[main branch on pull requests because the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m50s)

[assumption here is that you're using](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m53s)

[pull request emerging changes. If this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m54s)

[is a private repository where you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m56s)

[just cowboying everything into main, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h26m58s)

[probably don't need this. But I often](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m00s)

[will even use pull requests even on my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m02s)

[private repositories just because I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m04s)

[too lazy to run the test before I push.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m07s)

[And so I'll just pull requests and say](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m08s)

[I'll let I'll let the the actions run my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m10s)

[test for me. I'm too lazy to do that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m13s)

[locally. The other thing is I like to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m14s)

[default my shell to um PowerShell core.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m17s)

[This is something that I tend to do um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m21s)

[even when I'm compiling on Ubuntu](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m24s)

[runners um or Linuxbased runners is just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m26s)

[go to PowerShell core. That way I have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m28s)

[one scripting language I have to pay](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m30s)

[attention to and I'm not worried about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m32s)

[the subtle differences between um how](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m33s)

[you might set variables or do outputs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m36s)

[for um Bash versus PowerShell. I just I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m39s)

[default it one way and I leave it there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m42s)

[So if you prefer bash over PowerShell,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m44s)

[just switch it. There you go. Uh we are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m47s)

[building a WPF app here. So Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m49s)

[latest is a requirement. We check out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m51s)

[our code. We set up.net. And the key](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m53s)

[thing here is we set up net with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m55s)

[global.json file. Oo, I just noticed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m57s)

[something. My global.json isn't added to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h27m59s)

[the solution.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m02s)

[Uh let me bring that in because that was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m04s)

[something I didn't talk about. Um we'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m07s)

[circle back to this here in just a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m09s)

[moment.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m10s)

[because we need to we need to bump that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m12s)

[too apparently as well. Um it'll roll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m13s)

[forward to latest feature so I'll be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m16s)

[fine on this particular machine. Um but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m17s)

[when it runs the setup.net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m20s)

[to know which versions of net to install](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m22s)

[it is leveraging the global.json file.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m24s)

[So let's talk about this guy here. This](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m27s)

[is a file that there's kind of some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m29s)

[debate about whether you should or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m32s)

[shouldn't have one of these things. This](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m34s)

[controls your .NET tooling version](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m36s)

[that's going to go through here. Um, one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m40s)

[of the nice things about having it is if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m42s)

[somebody fires up your solution and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m44s)

[doesn't have the right version of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m45s)

[SDK installed and they're running a new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m47s)

[enough version of Visual Studio to have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m49s)

[the feature, they will get a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m51s)

[yellow prompt kind of in this area here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m53s)

[showing them, hey, you're missing uh the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m56s)

[required.NET version. Would you like to,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m58s)

[you know, click here to install? Right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h28m59s)

[And it'll automate the install for them.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m01s)

[Um, you'll also get a slightly better](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m03s)

[error message if you try to compile and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m04s)

[you don't have the right SDK version.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m06s)

[So, small things like that are kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m08s)

[convenient. Um, you'll note I do have a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m10s)

[roll forward to the latest feature. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m13s)

[for doing this though, it's kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m16s)

[important to understand how.net does](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m18s)

[their versioning because there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m21s)

[actually four numbers here, not just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m23s)

[three. Right? So you've got your major](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m26s)

[version, your minor version, and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m29s)

[this guy here is your quarter, and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m32s)

[the last two digits are your patch. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m35s)

[you will note that this digit here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m37s)

[always 100, 200, 300, or 400 because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m39s)

[there are four quarters in a year. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m42s)

[and so they are kind of packing extra](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m45s)

[data into three uh so they have four](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m48s)

[numbers in three digits. So just be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m51s)

[aware of that. So when you're doing the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m53s)

[the roll forward and it's like latest](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m55s)

[patch or latest feature, just understand](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h29m57s)

[that you are you're targeting this whole](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m00s)

[thing. So it lets stuff roll forward](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m03s)

[within the year or similar, right? So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m05s)

[that's that's just one thing that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m08s)

[worth um keeping a hold of. But by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m10s)

[having this global.json here, it lets us](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m14s)

[leverage the setup.net action to say,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m16s)

["Hey, by the way, that's the version of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m19s)

[net that I want." Because consistently](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m21s)

[what happens is the new version ofnet](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m23s)

[drops every November as the schedule is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m25s)

[now and we go I want to update to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m27s)

[latest stuff right net 10 is coming out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m29s)

[here in uh a little over a monthish](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m31s)

[because we're October 9th as I record](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m34s)

[this. Um so November is Geek Christmas.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m37s)

[We get a new.net. We all revved to net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m40s)

[10 because we all know how awesome](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m42s)

[that's going to be. Um because it looks](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m44s)

[sick. Um spoiler. Oh, actually slight](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m46s)

[detour.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m49s)

[Spokane.net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m51s)

[user group.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m53s)

[Uh, this for anyone who's interested.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m55s)

[Hey, look, it's me. Ah, come back. Come](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h30m57s)

[back. Come back. Come back. Come back.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m01s)

[So, there is a user group coming up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m03s)

[where I'm going to be going over](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m05s)

[everything that is new in Net 10, which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m06s)

[is going to be awesome. Um, so December](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m08s)

[2nd, 5:00 PM Pacific time will be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m11s)

[streamed online. You'll note hybrid](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m14s)

[event. So, if you are not local to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m16s)

[area, don't panic. As long as you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m19s)

[hit YouTube, you're good to go. So, uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m20s)

[feel free to sign up because we, uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m23s)

[like to have a good idea of numbers and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m26s)

[it helps me fill out some forms and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m27s)

[stuff. So, if you are interested in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m29s)

[that,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m31s)

[but it now gives us one less area where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m32s)

[we are trying to keep our net versions](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m35s)

[in sync because when the new version](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m37s)

[comes out, we rev our global.json to get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m39s)

[our tooling uh,net version updated. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m42s)

[then if we want our target framework](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m46s)

[that we're going to com uh that we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m48s)

[going to release for, we bump it here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m50s)

[Right? There is a two difference um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m52s)

[there there is a difference here between](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m55s)

[target framework of what we're going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m57s)

[compile towards and what we're going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h31m59s)

[use to compile that. Hey Izzy, merry](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m01s)

[Christmas to you as well. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m04s)

[I mean I have the the preview SDK](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m07s)

[installed because I'm running the Visual](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m10s)

[Studio Insiders.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m12s)

[works great. I I mean the the other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m14s)

[thing I'll point out for people,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m17s)

[Microsoft did something really cool. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m19s)

[let's see, net 10 standard support. They](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m20s)

[added a um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m24s)

[where is it? Microsoft offered a and and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m31s)

[I'll have to go hunt the link out. they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m34s)

[they offered what did they call it like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m36s)

[a production support um for net 10 for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m38s)

[people who actually want to run](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m42s)

[production workloads on net 10 there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m44s)

[a support thing out there for it because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m47s)

[some companies they won't update to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m49s)

[latest version ofnet until Microsoft has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m52s)

[like an STS or an LTS release so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m54s)

[standard term support or long-term](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m58s)

[support for those people who don't know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h32m59s)

[the acronyms uh which is fine right they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m01s)

[people don't want to beyond preview](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m05s)

[bits. They want something that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m06s)

[actually going to be supported by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m08s)

[Microsoft. And typically preview bits](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m09s)

[don't come with any support at all.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m11s)

[Microsoft says, "This is what it is.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m14s)

[Have fun, play, but you don't get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m16s)

[support." for net 10. They actually were](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m18s)

[like, "Hey, we'll actually um add](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m21s)

[support for um I I think it was RC1 or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m25s)

[RC2 of the Net 10 SDK, but you need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m29s)

[pay attention to the the support window.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m34s)

[It was fairly short. It was only like a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m36s)

[couple months. Don't quote me on that,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m38s)

[but it was a shorter window. And I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m40s)

[believe the expectation is if you are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m42s)

[running a production environment that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m45s)

[you can rev to net 10, you are probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m47s)

[working in an environment where fast](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m50s)

[iteration is possible, right? You are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m52s)

[not working in one of those highly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m54s)

[regulated environments where you upgrade](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m56s)

[once a year, once every 5 years,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m58s)

[whatever, right? And so they give us a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h33m59s)

[small support window and I believe the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m02s)

[expectation is that they're going to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m04s)

[the same thing on the next release](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m05s)

[candidates as well. That way if you are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m07s)

[using it, you you can stay in support,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m10s)

[but they need you to keep updating to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m12s)

[the latest the latest ones to stay in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m14s)

[support, right? All the way up until it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m16s)

[comes into November, which maybe it went](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m18s)

[till November and that's when they were](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m21s)

[terminated. I don't remember. It was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m22s)

[something shorter like that because they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m24s)

[were that confident that it was good](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m26s)

[enough to run production workloads on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m28s)

[it. Like where we were just about to ref](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m30s)

[Windows 95. Oh, dear heavens, Izzy. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m32s)

[actually remember doing a Windows 95](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m35s)

[install. Oh boy, that was an adventure.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m37s)

[Yes, I am old enough to have used a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m42s)

[version of Windows pre95,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m45s)

[which was scary. And I'm not that old.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m48s)

[Thank you. Refuse to admit to being old.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m52s)

[Okay, so that is that is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m55s)

[global.json. That that's the build. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h34m57s)

[most of this is fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m00s)

[straightforward. um we compile our app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m02s)

[in release mode because that's how we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m05s)

[release and we do specify this pversion.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m07s)

[This is where use doing versioning like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m10s)

[this can potentially overflow because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m13s)

[this version does use a system.version](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m15s)

[um as part of the assembly and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m20s)

[system.version has limits on how big](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m23s)

[numbers can be in each of these digits.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m26s)

[So just be aware. It also doesn't allow](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m28s)

[anything other than the the numeric in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m31s)

[each of these values. So unlike nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m35s)

[versions where you can the last bit you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m37s)

[can tack on like slalpha or slash](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m39s)

[preview or whatever you want and it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m42s)

[happy to accept alpha numeric in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m43s)

[last section uh system.version is not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m45s)

[okay with that. Um which one 31 or 311?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m48s)

[Ooh, Izzy, you're dating yourself that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m53s)

[you know that much. But 31 3-1 is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m55s)

[one that I had originally. My my kind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h35m58s)

[uncle gifted me a 3-1 machine that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m00s)

[I think it had been something that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m04s)

[retired from his work or similar. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m06s)

[admittedly, I was too young to know what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m08s)

[it was, but it was really fun to punk](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m10s)

[around on and play games on and whatnot.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m12s)

[And I love that little machine. It was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m14s)

[wonderful. I was very sad when it died.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m16s)

[Um, okay. After we compile, we run test.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m19s)

[And this is where things get mildly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m23s)

[interesting is when you run tests, we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m24s)

[specify the same configuration and we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m28s)

[specify d- no build. Something I see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m30s)

[people mess up on a lot is they do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m33s)

[something like this and the default](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m35s)

[configuration is debug and when you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m37s)

[don't compile, net test doesn't do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m40s)

[anything because it sees no output in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m42s)

[the bin release directory. So that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m44s)

[doesn't work. Um, so just make sure that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m48s)

[you test against the same configuration](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m50s)

[that you compile against, especially if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m52s)

[you're spa specifying no build. The](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m54s)

[other thing I see people do is something](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m56s)

[like this where they compile, release,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h36m59s)

[and then test debug, which isn't great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m01s)

[because if you have a pound if debug,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m03s)

[you're now testing against something not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m05s)

[what you built for. So, uh, yeah, don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m07s)

[do that. Um, and then the last thing is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m09s)

[the code coverage because um, we'll see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m12s)

[that get used a little bit later, but I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m15s)

[also specify it into a build. Directory.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m17s)

[Putting your build artifacts in a build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m20s)

[folder is just kind of a conventiony](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m22s)

[thing that a lot of um, stuff does.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m24s)

[Um, and then I do uh, a report generator](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m27s)

[just built taking the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m30s)

[um, the output XML files and building up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m33s)

[uh, a code coverage report. Again, we'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m36s)

[see that in a moment. And then I write](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m39s)

[the PR number. And this is going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m42s)

[matter here in a moment. So once again,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m45s)

[inside the build directory, I am just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m46s)

[arbitrarily creating a file called pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m49s)

[request number where I'm just dumping](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m51s)

[the pull request number in here. And it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m53s)

[this is only possible when a when this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h37m56s)

[build is running because the trigger was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m00s)

[pull request because this um event](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m02s)

[number isn't going to represent a pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m06s)

[request number if it's say a build from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m09s)

[my main branch. So see with all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m11s)

[floppy discs lol no one these days](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m14s)

[remembers that pain. It's just download](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m17s)

[it and run it. I know I know. Um, I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m18s)

[used to have a stack of fun colored](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m21s)

[floppy discs that my wife turned into a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m23s)

[nice Christmas wreath. She took all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m25s)

[red and green ones. So, I I will pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m26s)

[that out and show it on stream when we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m28s)

[get it out for Christmas cuz that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m30s)

[always fun. Um, so we write this PR](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m32s)

[number. Again, we'll see usage of this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m36s)

[in a minute. And then finally, we upload](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m37s)

[the code coverage report. And you'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m39s)

[note both the PR number file and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m41s)

[code coverage report are both inside](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m44s)

[this same directory. And then also just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m46s)

[as a fail safe, if there are no files in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m49s)

[this directory, I assume something has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m52s)

[gone catastrophically wrong and I throw](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m54s)

[an error and die because I don't want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m56s)

[continue.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m58s)

[Uh finally, if we are not a pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h38m59s)

[request, we are going to go through and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m02s)

[do a uh a net uh publish because this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m04s)

[actually taking your um published app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m09s)

[and saying, okay, now we're going to get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m12s)

[a published version that we can ship out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m13s)

[somewhere. And at some point, I am going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m16s)

[to add vellac publishing into this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m18s)

[template. That'll probably be a d- novel](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m20s)

[pack or some option like that for people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m23s)

[who don't want it. Um, but I I've just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m25s)

[started publishing all of my apps that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m28s)

[way. So, I I kind of want it in here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m30s)

[because again, this is this is how Kevin](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m32s)

[likes to build and publish his apps. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m34s)

[but once again, I'm specifying a publish](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m36s)

[directory where this output is going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m38s)

[go along with a version in here. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m40s)

[you'll note there's a small category](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m42s)

[here. If publishing single file remove](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m44s)

[the d-- no build because when you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m47s)

[publish single file you actually need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m49s)

[have another compile here to get the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m52s)

[single xy. So um if you turn that option](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h39m56s)

[on um which I believe I have commented](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m01s)

[um for doing uh single file um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m07s)

[applications. So you'll note even in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m12s)

[build option from the net publish. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m16s)

[if you are wanting just a um a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m19s)

[self-contained single file exe, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m22s)

[the stuff you turn on. All right, just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m26s)

[be aware that this is the stuff that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m28s)

[goes in. Um and there's a very specific](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m30s)

[publish single file bit here. Um because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m33s)

[this is done as part of a build step,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m36s)

[not the publish step, you do need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m38s)

[actually recompile.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m40s)

[It also breaks some tooling like the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m42s)

[built-in ZAML explorer. um when you have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m44s)

[things like publish single file turned](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m47s)

[on which is why I have this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m49s)

[configuration not debug. So locally as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m50s)

[long as you're running debug all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m54s)

[tooling works if you go release things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m55s)

[like the the ZAML explorer won't work](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h40m57s)

[properly. So just be aware of that. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m00s)

[that's one of the downsides of single](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m04s)

[file. But if you want it you uncomment](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m06s)

[this and you uh drop the d-n no build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m08s)

[here and you should be good to go. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m12s)

[then uploads the artifacts. Good to go.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m14s)

[We're off to the races. This last one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m16s)

[here is a action that I really, really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m19s)

[enjoy. So, this is a automerge on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m22s)

[dependabot PRs. So, this is very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m26s)

[specific and it does require you to do a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m28s)

[little bit of setup um on your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m30s)

[repository to make sure that you have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m33s)

[the right repository settings set up.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m36s)

[More importantly, in order to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m38s)

[autocomplete a PR, you have to have a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m39s)

[handful of, and this should open up my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m42s)

[PowerShell script, you have to have a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m45s)

[handful of things set up like enabling](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m47s)

[automerge on your repository. Um, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m50s)

[prefer to have linear uh uh builds here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m53s)

[So, I turn off things like uh merge](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h41m58s)

[commits and favor squashes and rebases.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m01s)

[So just be aware there is some extra](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m04s)

[setup to have this thing work. Again, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m06s)

[prefer to have this because if my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m09s)

[pipeline builds and passes, it means my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m11s)

[app compiled. It means my tests all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m14s)

[pass. There's pro it's probably not that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m16s)

[bad to merge the dependabot PR, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m19s)

[So unless I have a reason to not do it,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m22s)

[I oftentimes will let my dependabot PRs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m24s)

[automerge, which is convenient because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m27s)

[then all my dependencies are typically](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m28s)

[up to date. I don't fight CVES nearly as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m30s)

[much. It's just convenient. So, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m34s)

[the setup for that. If you don't want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m36s)

[your dependabot stuff automerging, just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m37s)

[get rid of this job. You don't need it,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m40s)

[right? And that gets you down to here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m42s)

[Now, we still have one more action to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m44s)

[look at, and it has to do with this poll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m46s)

[request stuff. So, let's go here. And if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m49s)

[we look into here, this code coverage](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m51s)

[comment. So you will note this um code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m54s)

[coverage PR comment um runs on a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h42m57s)

[workflow completion of build WPF sample.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m01s)

[So it's worth noting that these things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m05s)

[are linked based upon this name. So this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m09s)

[code coverage comment runs when this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m14s)

[workflow is completed. Okay, simple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m17s)

[enough. Workflow A finishes, workflow B](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m20s)

[runs. But you'll note the trigger for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m23s)

[this is now a workflow run, not a PR or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m25s)

[otherwise, right? And so it comes in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m28s)

[here and goes, okay, wait a minute, what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m31s)

[we need to know is was the the other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m34s)

[thing a pull request? And if so, did it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m37s)

[succeed? So if it did, what we're going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m40s)

[to do is we're going to download those](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m43s)

[artifacts, specifically the code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m44s)

[coverage artifacts that we uploaded. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m46s)

[we have to leverage the GitHub token to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m48s)

[to grab them.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m50s)

[We pull out the pull request number](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m52s)

[which is that extra file that we wrote](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m54s)

[and we store it in a variable that we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m56s)

[can then reference further down here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h43m59s)

[And then we use this um sticky pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m01s)

[request comment action. So the idea here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m04s)

[is a sticky comment. Um it has a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m07s)

[a commented line inside of the GitHub](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m11s)

[comment that identifies it so that if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m13s)

[you post this comment multiple times](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m17s)

[rather than just always appending a new](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m19s)

[comment to the pull request, it'll just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m21s)

[update the existing comment. This is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m23s)

[this recreate here of how it's able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m25s)

[do that. And so it goes through and it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m27s)

[um takes the the generated report from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m31s)

[over here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m37s)

[um the the code coverage report and it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m39s)

[says okay I'm going to go ahead and post](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m42s)

[the um the code coverage as a comment on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m44s)

[the PR just as a nice way of being able](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m49s)

[to see what the code coverage of the PR](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m52s)

[was because oftentimes what I see people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m54s)

[do is they run the code coverage and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m56s)

[it's part of the pipeline but it's very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h44m59s)

[easy to miss again something I like if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m01s)

[you don't like it doing is uh you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m04s)

[get rid of it, right? And so once again,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m06s)

[there is a little bit of setup that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m09s)

[need to do to enable this functionality](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m11s)

[to work. Some people may not like this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m13s)

[Again, I try to leave appropriate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m15s)

[comments where they are.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m17s)

[Okay, that is all of the stuff out. That](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m20s)

[is all the stuff in my template outside](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m22s)

[of the app before we even get to the WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m24s)

[app. And you will find that in a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m27s)

[my templates, a lot of this same stuff](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m29s)

[is just the same, right? Same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m32s)

[principles, same files, same technology,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m34s)

[maybe some tweaks around a handful of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m36s)

[them, but there's not a there's not a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m38s)

[lot of differences there, right? Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m40s)

[let's look at the test one first. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m43s)

[this one is one that we may be updating](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m45s)

[tonight because I've got an open copilot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m46s)

[PR that I need to go review. Um, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m49s)

[will note the um I I skipped over the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m52s)

[directory packages props earlier. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m56s)

[this is leveraging something called](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m58s)

[centralized package management because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h45m59s)

[one of the things that gets very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m02s)

[annoying is revving packages and having](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m03s)

[nougat packages at different versions on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m06s)

[different projects. In most cases you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m08s)

[want your version of say xUnit to be the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m11s)

[same on every single project. And you'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m15s)

[know this is not running xunit v3.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m18s)

[That's one of the things in the other PR](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m20s)

[that's going to be updated to is I want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m21s)

[xunit v3 in here rather than v old. um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m23s)

[because cool and newer and nicer is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m26s)

[better.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m28s)

[But again, some stuff that I prefer to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m30s)

[have for my testing. I like using uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m32s)

[mockq. I like using my automock library.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m35s)

[Um and so it it should just uh again](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m39s)

[things that I like to use. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m44s)

[Izzy uh rev to 530 yesterday. I thought](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m45s)

[I would try the inherit on secondary](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m49s)

[color of a custom theme. My boss didn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m52s)

[like it. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m54s)

[fair enough. I I can't always change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m57s)

[people's. Uh, also turned on the blur](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h46m58s)

[for draw host and he kept trying to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m01s)

[adjust his goggles thinking he was not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m03s)

[seeing it properly. Sadly, I had to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m05s)

[back to the ugly old style. Well, okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m07s)

[At least you're not telling me there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m09s)

[bugs in it. So, that's good. To each his](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m10s)

[own. Um, yeah, you could try dialing up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m13s)

[the blur a little higher. Um, I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m17s)

[remember where we set the default radius](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m20s)

[on it. um it may be a little low. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m22s)

[one of those things that the blur is not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m25s)

[necessarily part of the spec, but it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m28s)

[shows up in a lot of implementations.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m31s)

[And so I I think I think it was Corins](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m33s)

[that added it. Default I think is seven.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m36s)

[Yeah. And depending on how big your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m38s)

[window typically is, you may want to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m41s)

[a little higher. Um but I mean that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m43s)

[why we left it configurable because it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m46s)

[kind of hard to know exactly what the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m47s)

[appropriate blur radius is. Some people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m49s)

[want it showing through more and it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m51s)

[like, oh, if you do too high of a blur](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m53s)

[radius it, you know, I I can't tell](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m54s)

[what's under it anymore. It's like,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m57s)

[yeah, then tweak it. So, it's not that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h47m58s)

[isn't something that's actually called](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m02s)

[out in the spec. It's just something we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m03s)

[added because it's common enough. Uh, my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m05s)

[dev config turns it on. Nice. Nice.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m09s)

[Yeah, because there is a there is a lot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m12s)

[of nice stuff that's in there. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m14s)

[yeah, the inherent on the secondary](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m17s)

[color like that is one of those things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m18s)

[where it's like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m21s)

[maybe people like it, maybe people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m23s)

[don't. It kind of depends. It I find](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m25s)

[that people who have a strong branding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m27s)

[of their application probably don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m30s)

[leverage inherit that much, but people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m32s)

[who are building more like consumer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m34s)

[focused apps are more likely to use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m36s)

[something like that. So, it kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m40s)

[depends on on the target audience a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m41s)

[little bit on where it makes sense to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m43s)

[use it because inheriting somebody's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m45s)

[Windows theme color may legitimately](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m47s)

[make some parts of your app look worse](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m50s)

[because you have to kind of account for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m52s)

[the fact that it could be kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m54s)

[anything. Um, even though most people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m55s)

[are probably just picking one of the I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m57s)

[don't know 16 Windows-based colors.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h48m59s)

[Um, but there is it is one of those](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m02s)

[things. It's like it's nice when it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m05s)

[feels like it matches what the user set.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m06s)

[Um, but if you've got a really strong](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m08s)

[themed app, maybe not. Maybe not.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m11s)

[Um, okay. Anyway, so test project. Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m15s)

[let's see. Actually, try it on both](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m18s)

[floors and set the color adjust. I like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m20s)

[it that way. Yeah, I personally leave I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m23s)

[like to leave my color adjust turned on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m26s)

[because otherwise I find that if I allow](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m28s)

[the user colors to come in and I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m32s)

[leave the color adjust on, there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m33s)

[almost always something that I can't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m36s)

[read. And so letting it auto adjust the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m38s)

[colors and just say, you know what, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m40s)

[care less about the colors than I do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m42s)

[about accessibility, therefore make it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m44s)

[readable. Um, I like it a lot better. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m46s)

[it's just the way I roll. But again, it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m48s)

[I tend to build slightly like outside of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m51s)

[my day job, I tend to build more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m54s)

[consumerry facing thingies um rather](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m55s)

[than](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h49m58s)

[we'll call them line of business apps](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m00s)

[where I think people get a little more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m03s)

[picky about no I want it to be branded](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m04s)

[like my company and I don't want it to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m06s)

[ever change. Okay, fine. Fine. Don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m07s)

[give your users choice. I get it. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m10s)

[okay, test CS project. So couple things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m13s)

[that I turn on here is test project is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m15s)

[one of the things that MS build uses](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m17s)

[just to identify test projects. Um and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m19s)

[then packable and publishable are just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m21s)

[turned off so that when you run um net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m24s)

[pack or net publish against the solution](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m27s)

[um this guy intentionally gets excluded](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m30s)

[from that set of things that might get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m33s)

[published. So if you add more projects](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m34s)

[to my solution just be aware um if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m36s)

[don't turn these things on uh or turn](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m39s)

[these things off it may bite you. I may](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m42s)

[migrate these ones out of here and move](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m45s)

[them up to the directory props and just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m47s)

[automatically apply them to any project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m49s)

[that ends in tests. I don't It's one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m51s)

[those things where it's like it's it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m54s)

[more convenient, but it's also more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m56s)

[magical. And I I I try to balance a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h50m57s)

[little bit between what's convenient and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m00s)

[what's good. But a lot of my bigger](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m02s)

[solutions that I work with, there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m04s)

[typically a naming scheme for test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m06s)

[projects. And so I will often times](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m07s)

[uh leverage my props file to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m11s)

[automatically toggle these things for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m12s)

[everything that matches a project that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m14s)

[a unit test name.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m16s)

[Yeah. Helps when you can make things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m18s)

[that cannot be branded. Yeah. Everything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m20s)

[is just black and gray.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m22s)

[Exactly. Exactly. Um, but on the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m24s)

[centralized package management, you do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m28s)

[have the ability if if you ever find](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m30s)

[that you do need to override. There is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m32s)

[version override that you can specify on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m35s)

[a per project level. So if you have then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m38s)

[your centralized version of what it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m41s)

[supposed to be, but you decide, hey, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m43s)

[know what, I'm going to override and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m45s)

[want 530 in my WPF app. Great. You can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m47s)

[version override there. You'll also note](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m51s)

[I bring in a lot of the DI stuff. We'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m53s)

[look at that in a moment as well as the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m55s)

[MVVM toolkit which is just absolutely](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m57s)

[awesome.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h51m59s)

[Um these are the properties for going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m01s)

[through and enabling centralized package](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m04s)

[management. This one here is critical](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m06s)

[for when you're dealing with vulnerable](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m08s)

[Nougat package because what will happen](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m10s)

[is say material design has uh a CVE in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m13s)

[one of its dependencies right not in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m18s)

[library itself but something it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m20s)

[references maybe it references you know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m21s)

[one system text.json JSON and there's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m23s)

[CVE in version 8.0.0 or something,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m25s)

[right? What you can do is you can add a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m28s)

[reference to the transitive uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m30s)

[dependency in your directory packages](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m32s)

[props and update that dependency to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m35s)

[version you want. And then this will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m38s)

[automatically pin that transitive](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m40s)

[dependency to that newer version.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m42s)

[because by default when Nougat is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m45s)

[figuring out which dependency to bring](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m47s)

[in it brings in the lowest version that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m49s)

[satisfies all constraints which is okay](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m51s)

[but often times lower versions have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m55s)

[vulnerabilities and newer versions](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m57s)

[don't. So being able to rev those](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h52m58s)

[transitive dependencies and pin them um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m00s)

[is something I often use. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m02s)

[Don't you ever use multi-level directory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m05s)

[props? Um yeah. So, if you have your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m07s)

[thing set up with like a a source and a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m11s)

[props file, um I I absolutely will go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m14s)

[that route when possible. Um, and that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m18s)

[why in my template I have this line here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m20s)

[to say, hey, if you if you do put one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m23s)

[these things down underneath like a test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m25s)

[directory, but you still want to have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m27s)

[say like your laying version set at the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m29s)

[repo level, you can kind of chain them](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m31s)

[together because I always frankly forget](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m34s)

[the syntax for this line. And so I leave](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m37s)

[it commented here so I can go, "Yep,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m40s)

[thank you very much. That's exactly what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m42s)

[I needed. Good to go." Right? So, if I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m43s)

[did end up putting one down, um, my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m45s)

[templates don't nest the test projects](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m49s)

[underneath like a source or test folder.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m51s)

[I've contemplated giving that a a run,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m53s)

[but it's one of those it's like my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m57s)

[samples are small enough that I I only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h53m59s)

[do that if the project is going to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m02s)

[big enough and warrants it. It warrants](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m04s)

[that. So, at least for my templates,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m07s)

[it's kind of like I don't know if I jump](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m10s)

[immediately there unless I know that my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m12s)

[app is going to need it. Let's see. How](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m13s)

[do I debug material design controls in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m16s)

[my app? I can't step through the code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m18s)

[when I install the library through the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m20s)

[Nougat package. I manually downloaded](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m21s)

[the source code and added the reference](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m23s)

[to the thing uh to the material design](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m25s)

[thing WPF. Uh I assume that's project or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m27s)

[DLL and the WPF project, but uh but I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m30s)

[not able to set up correctly. Ah, great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m33s)

[question. So, I can actually show you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m35s)

[right here on this one that I've got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m37s)

[because this thing has um this guy here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m39s)

[So, one of the things that should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m42s)

[hopefully be working um if I go here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m44s)

[if you have source link enabled](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m48s)

[um because the fact that you're wanting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m51s)

[to go through and debug I assume we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m54s)

[talking about the C# side um and just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m57s)

[you know F11 type thing. So, if you have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h54m59s)

[source link enabled, you should actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m03s)

[be able to step through the Nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m06s)

[package.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m07s)

[I hope. Now, I'm going to go double](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m09s)

[check to make sure that I'm not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m11s)

[misremembering misremembering. And I do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m13s)

[have source link turned on because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m15s)

[source link should be enabled on this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m18s)

[guy.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m20s)

[I just realized packages is lowercase.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m22s)

[That's dumb.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m24s)

[Uh oh. Do I not have source link](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m26s)

[enabled?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m29s)

[Well, we're going to be fixing that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m33s)

[here. Um, okay. I take that back, Hazen.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m35s)

[Um, I don't have source link enabled,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m39s)

[and I should fix that. Um, because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m42s)

[source link allows you to step into code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m44s)

[when it is when the source is hosted out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m46s)

[on a public repository. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m48s)

[so scratch what I said about that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m52s)

[Apparently, I don't have it set up on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m54s)

[the material design library. I have it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m56s)

[set up on other libraries and not this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m57s)

[one. And I should fix that. Um, so that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h55m58s)

[is something that we may discuss here in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m01s)

[a moment as well. Um, but for what you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m04s)

[end up needing to do, so uh, because I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m07s)

[have both of these checked out, what I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m10s)

[would end up doing if I wanted to not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m12s)

[use the Nougat package. So I'll comment](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m13s)

[out the package reference here. I will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m15s)

[go add project reference. And actually,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m17s)

[I think I have to do this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m20s)

[You have to actually bring the projects](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m24s)

[into your solution.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m26s)

[because otherwise it will not uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m30s)

[reference it. And there are two that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m32s)

[you're going to need to do. You're going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m34s)

[to need to grab the WPF one. And because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m35s)

[the WPF one has a dependency on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m38s)

[colors one, you also need to add in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m41s)

[colors repository](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m44s)

[or the sorry the colors project as well.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m46s)

[So I'll come in here material design](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m49s)

[colors. Material design colors. Boom.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m51s)

[Boom. Boom. And then on my WPF sample, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m53s)

[can now add project reference and I can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m57s)

[reference material design themes here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h56m59s)

[And then if I change this guy up to my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m02s)

[WPF app, I should be able to run.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m05s)

[Chris, welcome rating party. It is good](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m08s)

[to have you guys. Hopefully you had a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m11s)

[good stream. I saw you were on earlier.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m13s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m16s)

[and thank you Ben codes for the follow.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m19s)

[I appreciate it. Super good. Excellent.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m21s)

[We are going through um my somenet](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m23s)

[templates that I have if anybody is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m28s)

[interested in netbased stuff. Um but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m31s)

[just walking through everything that I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m35s)

[have embedded into my template for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m37s)

[building out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m39s)

[uh new net projects. Uh I went way too](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m41s)

[late, but that just meant I could raid](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m44s)

[you. So win-win. See that? That's what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m45s)

[we're talking about.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m47s)

[Uh and thank you for the follow. I'm the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m49s)

[dev. I hopefully hopefully I got that. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m52s)

[am the dev Alex. So, welcome all. But](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m55s)

[yeah, going through some of this and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h57m58s)

[then if people are actually interested](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m00s)

[innet related stuff, uh I'm speaking at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m03s)

[a user group coming up in December, uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m06s)

[don't worry, it is livereamed on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m09s)

[YouTube, but it is 5:00 p.m. Pacific](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m11s)

[time. So, adjust that to whatever time](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m14s)

[zone you happen to be in yourself.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m17s)

[Um, yes. So, and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m21s)

[and then Heisen just answered your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m25s)

[question. Poof. Now I'm off to the races](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m27s)

[and I have I have my WPF library loaded](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m29s)

[up in here that I can now debug as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m33s)

[though it was any other library. And so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m35s)

[now I've got all my stuff. I can come in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m38s)

[here. I can set break points on this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m40s)

[And there we go. So key steps to note is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m42s)

[you need to make sure to include both](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m45s)

[the themes WPF project and the colors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m48s)

[WPF project in your solution. And then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m50s)

[you should be able to replace the Nougat](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m52s)

[package reference with just a project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m55s)

[reference straight to the material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m57s)

[design themes WPF. And between those two](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h58m59s)

[you should be good to go. I hope. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m02s)

[hope.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m05s)

[Awesome. Chris,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m08s)

[have fun gaming. I may end up having to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m11s)

[lurk you later after I uh get get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m14s)

[through here because, you know, there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m17s)

[always a handful of extra things to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m18s)

[always do. But thank you for coming and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m19s)

[joining. For people who don't know,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m21s)

[Chris does a lot of uh gaming and coding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m23s)

[streams. Um I don't know, Chris, if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m26s)

[have anything about what you were](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m29s)

[working on. I It tends to be I'm trying](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m30s)

[to remember your latest project that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m32s)

[were working on. Uh always extra stuff.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m35s)

[Exactly.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m38s)

[Um, but Chris also is uh uh one of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m39s)

[I'm trying to remember your title. Get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m44s)

[cracking uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m46s)

[dev outreach person. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m49s)

[yeah, working on my slides for a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m54s)

[pre-recorded talk for React Summit. Oh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m55s)

[cool. That'll be awesome. Um developer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=00h59m57s)

[advocate. There's the magical term we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m01s)

[going for. Uh yes. So for people who are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m03s)

[at all interested, he is absolutely](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m07s)

[awesome and I thoroughly enjoy all of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m10s)

[his talks on like the history of you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m12s)

[know Git Lens, Git Kraken, etc. and how](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m15s)

[the development stuff goes. So give him](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m17s)

[a follow, check out his stream because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m20s)

[it's always pretty cool.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m24s)

[Okay, and where there where we going? So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m26s)

[hopefully there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m31s)

[uh in app.zaml example for material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m33s)

[design. Uh, do I have to do anything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m35s)

[differently after adding the project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m37s)

[references? Uh, you shouldn't need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m38s)

[assuming your template looks very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m41s)

[similar to mine. Um, because the ref the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m44s)

[ZAML namespace references should still](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m48s)

[be the same here. Um, for anybody](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m50s)

[wondering, yes, this URL leads you to a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m54s)

[bad gambling site. Um, unfortunately](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m56s)

[it's a major breaking change to change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h00m58s)

[an XML namespace reference and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m00s)

[original owner of the library apparently](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m03s)

[let his DNS lapse and somebody is now](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m04s)

[domain name squatting on him. So don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m07s)

[go to this URL. That's bad. Um, but no,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m09s)

[it it should just work for you Heisen](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m13s)

[because inside of here my app is now off](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m16s)

[to the races and running and compiling](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m19s)

[without a without any Nougat package](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m21s)

[reference anymore. just with um a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m24s)

[singular project reference. And you'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m27s)

[note the project reference is pointing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m28s)

[to where I have downloaded the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m31s)

[source code from to be able to get it up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m34s)

[and running. So just between those two](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m36s)

[things, if that doesn't work, let me](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m40s)

[know. But it should be as simple as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m42s)

[getting rid of this package reference,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m44s)

[adding in a project reference, and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m46s)

[making sure both of these projects are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m49s)

[actually in your solution. because when](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m50s)

[you have a project reference, MS build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m53s)

[needs to know where the projects are so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m55s)

[that it can do the project dependency](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m57s)

[tree and compile them in order for you.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h01m58s)

[So, but other than that, you should be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m01s)

[you should be good and then off to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m03s)

[debugging thing and we will we will see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m05s)

[about adding source link to the library](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m08s)

[because that I thought I had done that a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m10s)

[long time ago. So, apparently I have not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m12s)

[added source link and I need to actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m15s)

[do that. So, that is that is bad on me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m17s)

[Um, okay. I'm going to drop these here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m20s)

[real quick. And we're going to stop](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m22s)

[debugging. That way we can kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m24s)

[continue stepping through some of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m26s)

[stuff. And then uh save changes. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m28s)

[don't save. Thank you. Thank you. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m32s)

[then I'm going to come in here and I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m35s)

[going to put this guy back so that we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m36s)

[just build real quick to make sure we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m40s)

[back in a working space.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m41s)

[Uh what are you what are you unhappy](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m44s)

[about? Restore the package. It's there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m47s)

[rebuild.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m50s)

[There you go. Um, so that build error](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m52s)

[there, I don't know if that's similar to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m55s)

[what you may have got, heen was because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m56s)

[the Visual Studio does a package restore](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h02m58s)

[in the background. And so if you try to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m00s)

[compile before it's done restoring](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m02s)

[packages, uh, it will no workie. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m04s)

[okay. So, back on the test project, um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m09s)

[a handful of things I prefer to bring](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m12s)

[in. And then the other feature that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m14s)

[worth calling out is something called um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m16s)

[global using statements. So C# added](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m18s)

[these in net 8 I believe for uh giving](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m21s)

[you a way to avoid having to put using](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m26s)

[all the stuff because you'll note even](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m28s)

[though I'm using the xunit fact](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m30s)

[attribute. I didn't have to go up to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m32s)

[top and go uh using xunit all of that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m34s)

[stuff. And you can see my ID is even](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m39s)

[grained out saying hey you [ __ ] you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m41s)

[don't need this. this is duplicated. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m43s)

[the idea with global using um and you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m45s)

[will see a lot of the uh base.net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m48s)

[templates do global using in a global](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m52s)

[using.cs file which is fine. It works.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m54s)

[It does this right? That's all it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m57s)

[doing is generating one of these global](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h03m59s)

[using in a file for you and they just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m01s)

[happen to name it globalus.cs.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m04s)

[The only thing I don't like about that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m06s)

[is then you have to either file link](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m09s)

[that that global using file in or you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m11s)

[have to duplicate it across every](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m14s)

[project. When you do it using MS build,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m15s)

[you can then leverage things like your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m19s)

[directory build props, directory build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m22s)

[targets to be able to uh share these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m24s)

[same global using across multiple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m27s)

[projects. And so like um Izzy was saying](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m30s)

[earlier about if you put a directory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m34s)

[build props um in say a test directory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m35s)

[then all of your test projects magically](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m39s)

[pick up the same global using. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m41s)

[again setup that I prefer. You don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m44s)

[have to use it if you don't like, but I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m47s)

[I think it is worth doing in a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m49s)

[cases because it's it just makes your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m51s)

[test projects easier to write and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m54s)

[especially whatever test framework](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m56s)

[you're using, you are almost assuredly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h04m58s)

[putting a using to that framework at the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m00s)

[top of every single one of your files.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m02s)

[So, the tests here are not overly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m04s)

[interesting. Um, there's a regular um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m07s)

[unit test for people unfamiliar with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m10s)

[pattern. I always favor the AAA pattern](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m12s)

[for structuring my unit tests. Arrange,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m15s)

[act, and then assert. Um, some basic](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m18s)

[guidance that I often give people is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m21s)

[your your name should reflect the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m24s)

[contents of your unit test. So the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m26s)

[first part of it should be reflective of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m30s)

[uh what is being tested, the condition](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m34s)

[under which it's being tested, and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m37s)

[finally the expected outcome. Because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m39s)

[when a test starts failing, one of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m42s)

[hardest things to figure out is which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m43s)

[end is wrong. Because when a test fails,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m46s)

[you want to know, hey, is the test wrong](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m49s)

[and it needs to be updated or is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m52s)

[code wrong and needs to be fixed, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m54s)

[So having uh that information captured](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h05m57s)

[in the name of the test almost works](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m00s)

[like a check sum to say, hey, is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m02s)

[code wrong or is the test wrong? Because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m06s)

[if you come in here and go, well, the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m07s)

[test is doing exactly as the name](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m09s)

[implies.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m10s)

[Great. That either means some um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m12s)

[assumption is wrong about what and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m15s)

[code is uh changed from when the test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m17s)

[was originally written and now you need](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m19s)

[to update it. But now it gives you all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m21s)

[of that information without having to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m23s)

[kind of parse through the test to figure](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m24s)

[it out. There's just a sample here about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m26s)

[a data driven test in XUnit because I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m28s)

[figured I would show off both of those.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m31s)

[And then finally, just one down here of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m32s)

[going through and doing. The last](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m35s)

[comment I'll make on the testing stuff](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m37s)

[is you will see some people make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m38s)

[comments about um only test a single](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m40s)

[thing or only have a single assert or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m44s)

[similar. I usually don't subscribe to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m46s)

[the you can only have one assert in your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m49s)

[test. Um even though that's how these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m51s)

[are set up, I usually tell people that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m54s)

[the you should only assert on one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m56s)

[logical thing, right? That may take](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h06m58s)

[multiple assertions, but you should only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m00s)

[assert on the stuff that you claimed in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m03s)

[your unit test name, right? So sometimes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m05s)

[that takes, you know, two or three](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m08s)

[asserts to get there or whatever it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m09s)

[going to be. I I think the pedantic idea](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m11s)

[of only one assert statement is a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m15s)

[too restrictive and it doesn't really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m17s)

[work in the real world. So that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m20s)

[everything with the unit testing. Oh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m23s)

[actually I do want to call out a couple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m25s)

[more things. So, automarker is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m31s)

[kind of like a DI uh dependency](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m32s)

[injection container for your tests. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m35s)

[specifically, it's one that I help](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m38s)

[maintain. The big idea here is it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m40s)

[decouples your tests from the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m42s)

[constructor. So, you'll note I am never](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m44s)

[calling new main window anywhere inside](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m45s)

[of here. Uh what about mocking versus](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m48s)

[integrations? Oh, codeex here. Great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m50s)

[question. Um I'll I'll address that too.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m52s)

[Uh the the idea here with having um the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m54s)

[the constructor decoupled is oftentimes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h07m59s)

[if you add a constructor parameter, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m01s)

[don't want to go through and update a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m03s)

[bunch of tests that may or may not be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m05s)

[using that parameter. Now there may be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m06s)

[an argument for uh separation of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m08s)

[concerns, that kind of thing. But](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m10s)

[nothing is more frustrating than having](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m13s)

[than making a small change and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m15s)

[spending three three times the amount of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m17s)

[effort to fix all of the tests that are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m19s)

[really only there because they're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m22s)

[coupled to the constructor. So this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m23s)

[gives you a way to decouple from the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m25s)

[constructor. Um and it'll populate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m26s)

[dependencies with mock objects instead.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m29s)

[Um the the question there about mocking](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m31s)

[versus integrations and similar. Um, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m34s)

[actually often times will tell people I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m37s)

[think mocks are kind of a necessary](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m39s)

[evil. Um, and specifically when](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m42s)

[possible, I prefer to actually write my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m46s)

[own test doubles. There's a a pattern](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m49s)

[that is not well documented called port](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m52s)

[adapter simulator where rather than](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m55s)

[mocks, you actually write simulators](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h08m57s)

[that serve as your test doubles. And the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m00s)

[idea there is the simulator is actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m02s)

[because a mock um is not the real thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m06s)

[And so the only assurances that your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m10s)

[test has that the mock is a good uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m12s)

[substitute for the real thing are you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m15s)

[promising that you've set it up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m18s)

[properly. Whereas with a simulator, if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m19s)

[you use the simulator in all of your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m22s)

[tests, if it turns out that your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m24s)

[simulator doesn't appropriately simulate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m25s)

[the real thing accurately, you can fix](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m28s)

[that in one place. And now all of your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m30s)

[tests gain the benefit from that, which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m33s)

[is really nice. Some people don't like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m35s)

[that because it literally means or in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m37s)

[their mind you're writing the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m39s)

[implementation twice. It's like, yeah,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m40s)

[but one is one is like an in-memory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m43s)

[implementation and then one is a not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m45s)

[inmemory implementation. And that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m47s)

[really really awesome to be able to have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m49s)

[both of those. So on on a lot of my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m51s)

[projects, I will actually build those](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m54s)

[types of simulator test doubles. And you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m56s)

[can go even crazier and make the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h09m58s)

[in-memory implementation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m01s)

[actually write tests over the in like I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m04s)

[know this sounds crazy, but you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m06s)

[write tests over the in-memory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m07s)

[implementation to to guarantee that it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m08s)

[a good u substitute for the real](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m11s)

[implementation. And now you're now](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m14s)

[you're really cooking. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m17s)

[again, there there's time versus return.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m20s)

[And so that is one of those areas where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m22s)

[it's like that is if I have my way and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m24s)

[have infinite time and I care a lot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m28s)

[about the quality and I'm not just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m30s)

[trying to churn something out, uh, port](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m31s)

[adapter simulator tends to be my my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m33s)

[go-to. And so I will I will still use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m37s)

[automocker as my DI kind of container,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m40s)

[but you can just do something like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m43s)

[mocker dot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m45s)

[Oh boy, I can't type. Mocker use. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m48s)

[then I can just inject my simulator](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m51s)

[types into here. Um, and then when I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m53s)

[call create instance, automacher will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m57s)

[go, oh, okay, I've got a simulator for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h10m59s)

[this thing. Oh, I don't have a simulator](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m00s)

[for this other thing, so I'll use a mock](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m02s)

[for that. And then it just builds it all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m04s)

[up for me. And it works really great,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m05s)

[which is awesome. Um, the other thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m07s)

[that I do have up here is this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m10s)

[constructor test. Um, this actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m12s)

[generates out and I think I can show it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m15s)

[assuming it's not going to ruin my day.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m18s)

[Uh, let's see. Is it uh where is it at?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m21s)

[Oh, it's underneath analyzers, I think,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m28s)

[is where this thing lives.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m29s)

[Test generator.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m32s)

[Oh boy. Naniti](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m35s)

[101,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m37s)

[thank you very much for the follow.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m39s)

[Let's see. codeex here. I've never done](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m41s)

[any C# unit testing and was thinking](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m43s)

[about it earlier today, so this is very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m45s)

[timely. Oh, perfect. I'm glad I could](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m47s)

[line it and thank you for the follow. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m48s)

[the the idea with the uh and it's not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m53s)

[showing the full implementation here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m56s)

[which is bothering me. Um this will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h11m58s)

[actually generate out. So some companies](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m01s)

[I think get overeager and they grade on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m04s)

[code coverage numbers um and they say](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m08s)

[you know your code always has to have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m12s)

[80% coverage or something otherwise it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m13s)

[fails the pipeline. I I personally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m15s)

[disagree with that assessment because in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m18s)

[my opinion code coverage is a negative](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m21s)

[metric. You don't have 80% coverage. you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m23s)

[have 20% non-covered because you can't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m25s)

[say anything about the quality of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m29s)

[covered code because it depends on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m31s)

[quality of the tests. I can write tests](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m34s)

[that just blindly execute code and get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m36s)

[my coverage numbers up, but if I've got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m38s)

[garbage asserts or garbage setups that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m41s)

[that coverage means nothing. Whereas the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m43s)

[code that is not executed, the thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m47s)

[that's uncovered, I can tell you 100%.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m49s)

[That's uncovered, that is got no tests](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m52s)

[and you know there's a potential for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m56s)

[risk there, right? So I always hate when](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h12m58s)

[people say, "Oh, you got to get code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m00s)

[coverage up to 80%." Because it's like,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m02s)

[no, it's what you're really saying is I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m04s)

[don't want to tolerate more than 20%](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m06s)

[uncovered. But people often forget that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m08s)

[coverage is kind of meaningless. And so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m10s)

[I I actually built this source generator](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m13s)

[here because often if especially if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m15s)

[you're building a library, you you need](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m17s)

[you should null check incoming um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m20s)

[constructor arguments to make sure that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m22s)

[they aren't null or similar. And the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m23s)

[problem is is each one of those checks](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m26s)

[to say is this null or not? um ruins](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m28s)

[your coverage numbers because it's if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m32s)

[you only ever test the happy case like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m34s)

[with create instance mocker create](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m36s)

[instance isn't going to send in a null](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m38s)

[unless you do some some effort to force](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m40s)

[it to. It's going to always try to put a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m42s)

[value in there for you and so it leaves](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m44s)

[50% of those lines in your constructor](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m46s)

[uncovered. This literally just genens up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m48s)

[a bunch of tests against the constructor](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m52s)

[and then each of those tests it inserts](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m54s)

[null for each argument one at a time and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m56s)

[validates that you throw an argument](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h13m59s)

[null exception with the right parameter](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m01s)

[name. That's it. Um and it is literally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m03s)

[there out of laziness and to and to make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m06s)

[it so that I don't pay a code coverage](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m09s)

[penalty when I write code for people who](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m12s)

[have those checks on their pipelines.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m14s)

[So, I I got so annoyed with it, I built](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m16s)

[a tool to auto my way out of it so that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m18s)

[I wasn't, you know, getting dinged on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m22s)

[that. Um, and because in my opinion, the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m24s)

[test that this generates are low value](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m27s)

[tests. Just to be clear, I built the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m29s)

[feature and I think it generates low](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m31s)

[value tests, but it's only there for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m33s)

[people who have like hard caps on their](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m36s)

[coverage numbers and go, "Well, we don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m38s)

[care if you're writing low value tests.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m39s)

[We want the test coverage." It's like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m41s)

[job anyway. Yeah. So, hate that. Um, but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m44s)

[again, my choice of libraries, mock and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m48s)

[auto mocker are my my go-to tools. Um, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m50s)

[kind of like xunit, but tunit is really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m54s)

[growing on me. So, if you're looking for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m58s)

[test frameworks, uh, those are my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h14m59s)

[go-tos.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m01s)

[Okay, now we get to the actual the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m03s)

[actual app, right? We started with a WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m05s)

[app template and we've haven't actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m08s)

[opened the app up. Um, okay. So key](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m10s)

[things in here that are automatically](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m13s)

[set up for you is I do set an app icon.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m16s)

[Um, and this is only here as a way to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m19s)

[show people how to set their app icons](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m22s)

[because I see so many desktop apps with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m25s)

[the default WPF icon that looks like it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m27s)

[was from like late Windows Vista days.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m30s)

[So please, please, please, please,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m33s)

[please change the icon. I thought about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m35s)

[making this something really ugly. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m37s)

[but instead I put my little logo thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m40s)

[in there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m42s)

[I I'm I'm a bit torn on this because I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m44s)

[worried that at some point somebody's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m47s)

[going to distribute an app, not change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m48s)

[the icon, and then somebody's going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m50s)

[blame me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m51s)

[So, I may I may regret this decision,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m53s)

[but the the idea here is to show people,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m55s)

[please make an icon, change it, do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h15m57s)

[something useful. Um, this sets it up.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m00s)

[This is the single um exi publishing. If](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m03s)

[you want to compile your WPF application](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m06s)

[down to a single exi that you can slap](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m09s)

[on a, you know, thumb drive or otherwise](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m12s)

[um and distribute that way, great. This](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m15s)

[is what you need to do to turn that on.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m17s)

[Again, I have it off only because it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m19s)

[mucks with debugging tools. And so I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m22s)

[often times don't use this because I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m25s)

[deploying with Vellopac, not as a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m27s)

[standalone XI, but it is a common way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m29s)

[that people want to build out their](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m31s)

[tools. So I leave it in here. Um the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m33s)

[package references we talked about a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m36s)

[little bit for the centralized package](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m37s)

[management already. The key ones here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m39s)

[obviously my material design library](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m41s)

[because I love it. Um and then the MVVM](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m43s)

[toolkit. Now for people who are new here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m46s)

[um if you check out my uh YouTube video](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m50s)

[um and hunt community toolkit you will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m53s)

[find a couple videos I have done on like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m55s)

[learn WPF or learn Avalonia with MVVM um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h16m57s)

[where I dive into a lot of the features](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m01s)

[of this community toolkit. This is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m03s)

[musthave for any net project that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m05s)

[working with MVVM. So it's not WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m08s)

[specific. You can use it on Uno, Maui,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m11s)

[Avalonia, WPF.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m14s)

[I don't think Windform's binding engine](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m16s)

[really works as well with it, but you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m19s)

[can leverage it in in plenty of places.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m21s)

[I even have a colleague that used it in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m23s)

[a Blazer application because why not,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m25s)

[right? Uh, not really the designed use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m28s)

[case, but anywhere where you have a good](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m30s)

[binding engine, this is a a go-to tool](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m32s)

[to to absolutely use for it. The last](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m34s)

[thing I'm going to point out here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m38s)

[this subtle change with my the app.zaml](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m40s)

[that's going on here. Now, the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m43s)

[resources app icon, this is just to make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m45s)

[sure that the app icon is included](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m47s)

[inside of um the WPF sample and shows up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m49s)

[as content. But this change here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m52s)

[actually a deviation from the WPF uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h17m56s)

[tooling and SDK. So, typically what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m00s)

[happens is if you right click on your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m03s)

[app.zaml ZAML and Go properties. What](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m05s)

[you will see and we're going to collapse](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m07s)

[Copilot is this build action is actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m08s)

[set to um application definition. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m12s)

[when it is set to application](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m15s)

[definition, it does a number of things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m17s)

[including generate your main method. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m19s)

[for people who are like WPF apps don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m22s)

[have a main method, they do. It's just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m24s)

[autogenerated for you um from your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m27s)

[app.zaml, ZAML which is fine for some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m30s)

[cases most cases probably but for the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m34s)

[setup that I like to use with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m37s)

[generic host I need to control the main](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m40s)

[method. though this sort of setup here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m42s)

[is what you will see in WPF applications](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m45s)

[where they explicitly want to override](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m48s)

[the main method and so we drop out of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m51s)

[the application definition which does](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m53s)

[the application startup with the main](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m55s)

[method and whatnot because once you do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m57s)

[this it says okay take it out we still](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h18m59s)

[want it treated as ZAML so we bring it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m01s)

[back in as just an arbitrary ZAML page](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m04s)

[so that we still get the ZAML compiling](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m06s)

[and that kind of thing for it because we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m08s)

[we want that we just don't want the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m09s)

[extra application stuff that goes along](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m12s)

[with it. So with that, let's actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m14s)

[look at it. So on the setup here, this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m16s)

[is set up with the material design](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m20s)

[basics for um kind of if you follow the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m22s)

[getting started guide for material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m26s)

[design, this is what you get. I have it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m28s)

[pointed at the material design 3 um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m30s)

[default style, but you can change the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m33s)

[three to a two if you'd prefer those. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m34s)

[it's just a three has some slightly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m37s)

[newer styles for some of the controls,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m38s)

[so I like them a little better. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m40s)

[then I just used the bundled themes and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m42s)

[the the purple and light green color](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m46s)

[selection here was arbitrary based on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m47s)

[nothing other than they matched my icon.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m50s)

[And so I went great. And then the base](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m52s)

[theme is either light, dark, or inherit.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m54s)

[In this case, it's inherit, which on all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m57s)

[of my system means I'm going to get a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h19m59s)

[dark theme because it says look at the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m00s)

[system theme and follow that. So if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m02s)

[would prefer to control the colors, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m04s)

[can set things up here. Um, the material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m07s)

[design library has more documentation on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m09s)

[it, but there is also like custom colors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m11s)

[if you don't like the built-in sets and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m13s)

[you want to, you know, control all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m15s)

[things. You can control all the things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m17s)

[if you would like. Um, but let's look at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m19s)

[the the code behind for it. So, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m21s)

[the key thing that once you turn off the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m24s)

[application definition, you're now on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m27s)

[the hook for actually starting up the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m29s)

[application and running it. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m32s)

[specifically doing something akin to um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m35s)

[the these lines here is what the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m39s)

[built-in WPF um application definition](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m42s)

[would generate for you inside of a main](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m46s)

[method. It does roughly this. Um, I say](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m48s)

[roughly because this line here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m50s)

[different. Um, but most of this is in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m52s)

[line with this. And the key thing here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m54s)

[is we have a regular main method and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m56s)

[then we have an async main because we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h20m58s)

[are leveraging asynchronous code for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m00s)

[setting this up. And then this leverages](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m03s)

[a what is called a generic host. So for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m05s)

[people who build ASP.NET core](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m08s)

[applications, they are they are very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m10s)

[familiar with like their startup CS or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m12s)

[if they're using top level statements in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m14s)

[their program CS where they've got kind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m16s)

[of this host builder and they do like a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m18s)

[bunch of configure services and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m20s)

[further down they do some sort of uh uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m23s)

[host and build and then run or similar.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m27s)

[Right? This is a generic host that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m31s)

[Microsoft put out. Um that same net user](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m33s)

[group page. There's actually a talk that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m37s)

[I did on the generic host of a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m38s)

[what it gives you. Um, some key things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m40s)

[are dependency injection, some built-in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m43s)

[logging, um, and your configuration](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m45s)

[bits, which is what we um, are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m49s)

[leveraging here. So, we we build up our](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m51s)

[host and down in this create host](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m54s)

[builder, this is where we go through and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m56s)

[add in all of our app configuration. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h21m59s)

[for here, I'm bringing in the defaults.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m02s)

[So there are um things like um app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m04s)

[settings.json that come in with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m07s)

[defaults, but I am also adding in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m09s)

[user secrets for my assembly as well. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m12s)

[and then this is where we end up doing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m15s)

[dependency injection um for anything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m17s)

[that we're going to end up using. And I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m19s)

[just show some examples here of things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m20s)

[that I am injecting.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m22s)

[Uh for bigger apps, I would not just let](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m24s)

[this little callback grow to infinity.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m27s)

[Um that's unmanageable. I oftentimes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m30s)

[will break out um this DI stuff into a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m33s)

[separate class where I can kind of group](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m36s)

[things accordingly. Um very much for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m39s)

[anybody who's worked with .NET Aspire.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m41s)

[They're kind of service defaults idea.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m44s)

[They pull it into a separate project.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m46s)

[For a desktop application, I just pull](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m48s)

[it into a separate file. But the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m50s)

[important ones here are the main window](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m52s)

[and the main window view model are both](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m55s)

[registered as DI dependencies. that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h22m57s)

[going to matter here in a minute when we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m00s)

[look at the main window view model. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m01s)

[and then I just show bringing in the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m03s)

[weak reference uh messenger. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m06s)

[specifically here this is showing in um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m09s)

[daisy chaining um DI dependencies where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m13s)

[you end up you register the weak](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m16s)

[reference uh messenger as itself as a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m18s)

[singleton and then we register it as an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m21s)

[i messenger. So these are the two keys](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m24s)

[that if it's asked for in a constructor](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m26s)

[parameter, the DI container can now](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m28s)

[resolve it either as a weak reference](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m31s)

[manager or an IM messenger. Um but if we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m32s)

[just did add singleton on both of these,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m36s)

[you could end up with two separate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m38s)

[references, which is not what you want.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m40s)

[You want a single reference. And so this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m42s)

[call over here, what this ends up doing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m44s)

[is saying, okay, if somebody asks for an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m47s)

[iM](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m49s)

[call back into the DI container, get the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m51s)

[weak reference messenger instance and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m53s)

[return that as the singleton. So both of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m55s)

[these end up with the same instance with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h23m58s)

[two registered keys. Um, and then we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m00s)

[register the dispatcher because the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m02s)

[number of times we need the dispatcher,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m04s)

[for example, like this, um, to be able](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m06s)

[to do UI stuff, um, we often need if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m09s)

[end up doing a lot of this in the view](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m13s)

[models, I often put this behind an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m16s)

[interface just for testability purposes.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m18s)

[But at least here, the dispatcher is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m22s)

[registered as a way to just let um, the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m24s)

[snack bar message cue be able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m27s)

[reference back to it. because if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m29s)

[have a snack bar reference queue that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m30s)

[you need to do a little snack bar](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m32s)

[reference, it is convenient to be able](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m33s)

[to have that guy leveraged here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m35s)

[Okay, we've built up our generic host.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m38s)

[We then start our generic host and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m41s)

[configure await true here um is so that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m44s)

[we um do the continuation which is this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m48s)

[bit here uh on the same thread that we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m51s)

[came in on. And because this is only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m56s)

[invoked from here where it was an STA](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h24m58s)

[thread, this ensures that our app is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m00s)

[created up on the UI thread which is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m03s)

[important. We need to make sure that our](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m05s)

[UI application is actually instantiated](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m07s)

[and initialized on our UI thread. Same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m09s)

[with the main window. Now when we call](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m12s)

[get required service for main window,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m16s)

[what's going to end up happening is it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m18s)

[going to invoke this constructor here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m20s)

[So you'll note this constructor takes in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m22s)

[the view model as a DI dependency and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m25s)

[intentionally set the data context](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m28s)

[before calling initialize component](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m30s)

[because if you set it after you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m32s)

[re-trigger bindings and cause a second](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m34s)

[pass that is otherwise unnecessary if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m37s)

[you set it up ahead of time. So this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m39s)

[a DI dependency here. But in order to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m42s)

[resolve this dependency, the DI](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m44s)

[container first has to resolve the main](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m46s)

[window view model. So we'll jump into](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m48s)

[that guy there. Um, and this is why the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m51s)

[um the source gen stuff didn't show a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m54s)

[constructor test because there are no](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m56s)

[parameters here. Um, let's see. Izzy, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h25m58s)

[just got to my coffee shop. Other drink](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m02s)

[types are available. Sound like Brit.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m04s)

[Um, very much Channel 4 reference. Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m06s)

[have been shouting at my phone since the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m09s)

[code coverage stuff.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m11s)

[Hopefully shouting at your phone and not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m15s)

[at me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m18s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m20s)

[but the DI container then resolves the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m22s)

[main window view model, gets that all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m24s)

[instantiated, and so it gives a nice way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m27s)

[of uh doing DI injection because oftent](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m30s)

[times with the default WPF app template](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m32s)

[for Microsoft, it kind of just leaves](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m36s)

[you to figure all of this stuff out.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m38s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m41s)

[and so I very much prefer to have this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m43s)

[DI style dependency so that I could use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m46s)

[say my auto mocker to inject and break](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m48s)

[it apart and having some way of of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m50s)

[bringing these things together. There is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m53s)

[one minor limitation in all of this in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m56s)

[that if you have if you want to do like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h26m58s)

[DI inside of a user control that's then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m00s)

[referenced inside of your ZAML, it gets](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m02s)

[a little more tricky. Um, one of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m05s)

[material design maintainers, Nikolai,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m08s)

[has a pretty slick way of working around](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m10s)

[that. And I've been contemplating](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m13s)

[pulling pulling in an example using um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m14s)

[that setup just to show a user control](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m19s)

[if people want it because it quite often](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m21s)

[comes that once you start diing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m23s)

[injecting all the things, you then get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m24s)

[to a user control and go uh I'm stuck.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m26s)

[Let's see. Um, let's see. Izzy, I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m30s)

[code coverage is a good an important](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m32s)

[metric, but only if you do mutation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m34s)

[tests to ensure your tests are actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m37s)

[useful and valid. I tend to use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m38s)

[striker.net. Okay. See, and I I can I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m40s)

[can agree with that in that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m43s)

[if you have some way of asserting that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m47s)

[your tests are good, then then code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m49s)

[coverage could be a positive metric.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m52s)

[Um, and yeah, mutation tests are like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h27m56s)

[there there is also then a trade-off of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m00s)

[the performance of doing all of those.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m02s)

[But yeah, maybe we should do a should do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m03s)

[a section on doing like striker.net for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m07s)

[mutation testing. That would be fun. We](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m09s)

[should should add that to the to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m12s)

[queue of things to cover because that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m13s)

[might be an interesting one to to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m15s)

[through and show off. Um, and then last](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m16s)

[thing in here, I just I I leave an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m20s)

[example of doing a command binding just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m22s)

[as a way of showing, hey, you don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m24s)

[always have to shell back to your view](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m26s)

[model for commands. Um, in this case,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m27s)

[there is a menu option here um for the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m30s)

[exit. Um, so there's a clear count,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m33s)

[which is a binding into a command in my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m37s)

[view model, but then there's also a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m40s)

[routed command that's leveraged here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m42s)

[And the the big idea with routed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m44s)

[commands is when they are executed, they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m46s)

[start from the element that executed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m49s)

[them and walk up the visual tree until](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m51s)

[they find a handler. In this case, the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m53s)

[menu item is the one that initiates the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m55s)

[close command. But the main window](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h28m57s)

[registers the command binding that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m00s)

[handles it. And when that command is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m02s)

[executed, it calls on close and just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m05s)

[closes the window. just as a simple way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m07s)

[of showing, hey, this is typically if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m08s)

[you have like various buttons in your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m11s)

[application that might close the window](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m13s)

[or similar, a routed command is often an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m14s)

[easy way of doing this. I've seen people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m18s)

[do all kinds of gymnastics when a simple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m19s)

[routed command will do do this. Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m22s)

[let's see. We can add it to the Enigma](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m25s)

[app. That's actually a great idea. We](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m27s)

[should totally do that. I I kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m29s)

[teased it a little bit because I I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m32s)

[gonna I'm I'm going to work on my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m34s)

[Avalonia template a bit and then once](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m35s)

[you get me the the stuff to move on next](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m37s)

[with then I'll have a a nice clean](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m40s)

[template to fire off from. So yeah, we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m42s)

[should totally add that. Um the the app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m44s)

[Izzy's is alluding to is the one that I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m47s)

[mentioned at the beginning of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m49s)

[stream. We're going to build a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m50s)

[app for an Enigma machine and I'll I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m52s)

[won't spoil too much on it until we get](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m54s)

[to it, but it'll be cool and it's open](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m56s)

[source and yeah, it'll be fun. It'll be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h29m58s)

[fun. It's gonna be fun. I'm very excited](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m00s)

[for it. Okay. And then the last thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m03s)

[here is just the view model. And this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m05s)

[thing is it like there's not a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m07s)

[code here because the MVVM toolkit is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m09s)

[really doing all of the heavy lifting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m12s)

[for us. Um the key things here are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m14s)

[deriving from observable object for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m16s)

[people who are familiar with MVVM and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m18s)

[WPF. You'll note that the I notify](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m20s)

[property change interface is key for all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m23s)

[of the binding. And that's really what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m25s)

[this community toolkit is giving us is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m27s)

[lot of um source gen functionality](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m30s)

[around those observable objects with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m33s)

[properties. So rather than making a um a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m36s)

[full observable property which again if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m40s)

[you check out my YouTube channel you'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m43s)

[see the learn MVVM videos um I kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m44s)

[break down how the observable property](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m47s)

[works and how much goes into actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m49s)

[implementing it properly. The community](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m52s)

[toolkit makes it a declare a field and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m54s)

[slap a property on it and you're done,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m56s)

[right? You only do this when it's like,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h30m58s)

[well, when this property changes, I also](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m01s)

[want to have this other command kicked](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m02s)

[off downstream as well. Great. Um, and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m04s)

[then down here, same sort of thing. With](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m07s)

[MVVM, you have this idea of the I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m09s)

[command interface, which is effectively](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m11s)

[the the action portion of all of this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m14s)

[It's a button click happens. What code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m17s)

[then runs after? Um, and so it's just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m20s)

[separates out having to go from button](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m23s)

[click all the way in. The I command](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m25s)

[interface also handles things like um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m27s)

[should the command be able to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m29s)

[executed, which often results in say the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m31s)

[button being disabled if the command](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m33s)

[can't currently execute, which is great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m35s)

[Like quite often that's kind of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m37s)

[functionality you want. And you don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m39s)

[you don't want to always have to bind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m41s)

[like the is enabled of a button just to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m42s)

[prevent the click. So having that all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m44s)

[kind of wrapped up in this commanding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m46s)

[style pattern um is great. uh codeex](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h31m48s)

[So yeah, feel free to drop in and always](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m01s)

[love questions and feedback and similar](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m03s)

[from people. So always happy to take](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m05s)

[stuff. Um and so this can execute here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m07s)

[is really that portion of that command](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m10s)

[that says, hey, is this command able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m12s)

[be run? This looks like it's an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m15s)

[arbitrary string, but if you were to say](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m17s)

[um go in here and do something like this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m24s)

[and assuming so for example, right, that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m27s)

[this could prove myself that I'm not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m30s)

[crazy,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m32s)

[right? This looks like an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m35s)

[string, right? But if I do this and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m36s)

[try to compile,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m38s)

[because this is source generated, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m40s)

[actually get a compile error now saying,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m43s)

["Hang on, something's wrong. This isn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m46s)

[quite working properly." Um because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m48s)

[uh even though it it's stringy like it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m52s)

[a string that's parsed by a source](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m56s)

[generator that's executed as part of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m57s)

[compilation. So it's kind of compile](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h32m59s)

[time checked. So, you can't really typo](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m02s)

[the string even if you tried. Um, but it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m05s)

[does give you that nice way of wrapping](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m08s)

[up that whole what's the execution](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m10s)

[action and can I execute that action?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m13s)

[And that gets you all the way through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m16s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m17s)

[I think that is potentially every single](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m20s)

[thing in my WPF template. Let me just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m23s)

[check my list to make sure I didn't Oh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m26s)

[that's the nougat one. Let me just make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m28s)

[sure I didn't miss anything in here. uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m31s)

[pipeline stuff. We did generic host,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m33s)

[centralized package man, build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m35s)

[customization, MVVM, material design,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m36s)

[editor config, testing with automacher,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m39s)

[nougat, package source mapping,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m42s)

[dependabot actions, pipeline, slnx file,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m43s)

[and we are good to go. That is all of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m47s)

[it. Izzy, hit me with the question.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m50s)

[Hit me with the question.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h33m57s)

[And then we may go we may go pow-wow and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m00s)

[play play on some of this stuff because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m03s)

[I want to we've got failing builds on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m05s)

[the material design project and I kind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m08s)

[of want to smash a couple of them. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m10s)

[I'll let you I'll let you type for a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m12s)

[minute and I'm going to go grab the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m14s)

[build artifacts](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m15s)

[from this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m17s)

[because I don't like having failing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m24s)

[tests. I'll leave this I'll leave this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m26s)

[guy up for a moment just in case your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m28s)

[question pertains to this. Otherwise,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m29s)

[I'm going to switch over. So, for people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m31s)

[unfamiliar, uh material design and ZAML](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m33s)

[is a WPF theming library. Uh some people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m36s)

[hate me because I am literally bringing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m40s)

[Google's material design to Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m42s)

[apps. And some people go, keep your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m45s)

[Google design language out of my Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m47s)

[apps. And I go, well, if it makes it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m49s)

[pretty, it's it's up to the app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m52s)

[developer. And uh frankly, I think the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m54s)

[material design stuff just looks nice.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m57s)

[I'm an Android guy, too. So maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h34m59s)

[I'm biased.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m01s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m04s)

[let's see. With the commands that have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m05s)

[the can execute, do you put the check in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m07s)

[the command too? Great question. Great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m09s)

[question. Right. So the idea being right](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m12s)

[here is should there be an if uh you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m15s)

[know count less than five, then do the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m18s)

[thing, right? Or or similar, right? So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m22s)

[duplicate up this or I've seen people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m24s)

[also do the can increment count, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m27s)

[You can merge it together however you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m30s)

[want. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m32s)

[it depends. Um, and here's what I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m37s)

[typically would tell people. Um, I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m40s)

[personally think that you should not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m44s)

[invoke things like the the increment](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m46s)

[count method directly from from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m49s)

[elsewhere.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m53s)

[Um, it's kind of like invoking your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m54s)

[command handler. JC, good morning. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h35m57s)

[but some people do, right? Like they're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m02s)

[like, well, but I've got this clear](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m05s)

[command and after I clear, what I really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m06s)

[want to do is all the same stuff in my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m08s)

[increment count, right? And so, like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m10s)

[this works, but if you're going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m14s)

[invoke it like this, you probably do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m16s)

[want to double up your check, right? If](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m19s)

[you're doing direct invocation, um I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m22s)

[often and and there's not a great way to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m25s)

[enforce this. I often prefer to tell](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m26s)

[people, hey, if there is shared logic](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m28s)

[that you want to be done between two](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m30s)

[relay commands, you know, uh private](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m32s)

[void uh do work, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m35s)

[Don't don't double up, right? Put the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m41s)

[put the count here, call do work here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m44s)

[right? and and go through and uh really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m50s)

[copilot you found similar code in other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m55s)

[repos really count++ is used in other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m57s)

[reposed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h36m59s)

[um and then call call do work in the in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m02s)

[the same place here so it it depends a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m05s)

[little bit um I I usually don't like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m07s)

[doubling up the checks but it is kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m11s)

[necessary if you have people directly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m15s)

[invoking these methods](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m17s)

[So, so yeah, like and like I said, it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m22s)

[does kind of depend a little bit. You](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m24s)

[don't need to. So, if the command is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m26s)

[only being done from um WPF via the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m29s)

[binding going through the command, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m34s)

[don't need to worry about it being](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m36s)

[invoked when the can execute has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m39s)

[returned false. Right? That if that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m40s)

[happening, you've got some other bug](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m44s)

[elsewhere. Um, and the the solution is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m46s)

[not to hide it in in the relay command.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m49s)

[But again, if people are doing direct](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m51s)

[invocations where they're calling into](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m53s)

[this method directly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m56s)

[and the check is worth validating on,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h37m59s)

[yeah, it's probably worth including it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m01s)

[in both places. So, like I said, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m04s)

[generally Yeah, potato versus potato.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m07s)

[Yeah, exactly, Izzy. Exactly. So, yeah.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m10s)

[Um, I usually tell people don't do a lot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m14s)

[of extra work in here. If there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m18s)

[something that needs to be shared, break](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m20s)

[it out into a shared method and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m21s)

[just use that in both places. That's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m23s)

[kind of my preference. Um, but again,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m25s)

[there's there's nothing stopping you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m28s)

[from doing it. The other thing you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m30s)

[kind of do, and I've I've done this in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m32s)

[the past as well, is if you really want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m34s)

[something to chain from one command into](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m37s)

[another, right? You can actually do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m40s)

[something of this nature. The the thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m44s)

[is is if you call execute directly,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m46s)

[execute does bypass can execute. There's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m50s)

[nothing. So if something directly hits](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m53s)

[the command](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m56s)

[um but I've often written um extension](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h38m57s)

[methods on I command that basically wrap](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m01s)

[up the call to can execute followed by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m03s)

[execute um and leverage that. That way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m06s)

[it's like if I'm going to daisy chain, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m10s)

[I often do it in this manner because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m12s)

[this feels a little nicer. And usually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m15s)

[if I'm daisy chaining like this, it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m17s)

[because I've got like a a manual key](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m19s)

[handler or something of that nature](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m22s)

[where I've got some other thing coming](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m24s)

[into the system where I then want it to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m27s)

[behave the same as if the user clicked](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m30s)

[the button, right? And so I'll have an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m31s)

[extension method that says execute if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m34s)

[you know if able or or something of that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m36s)

[nature, right? So this then checks can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m39s)

[execute and then shells out to execute.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m41s)

[So great question though. Great question](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m44s)

[because it the the MVVM toolkit in some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m48s)

[ways actually makes this pattern easier](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m51s)

[to fall into um just because it's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m54s)

[little bit nicer.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m57s)

[Okay. Okay. Let's go. Let's go smash](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h39m59s)

[some of these tests to the ground. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m02s)

[this was one that annoyed me because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m04s)

[this is literally updating that um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m07s)

[dependabot action that I showed off](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m11s)

[earlier. That'll automerge dependabot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m12s)

[PRs for me. And it didn't automerge on a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m14s)

[minor version rev because a unit test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m18s)

[failed. Now, obviously, that action has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m21s)

[literally nothing to do with the unit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m23s)

[test whatsoever. So, what we want to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m25s)

[here is figure out what the heck went](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m28s)

[wrong. So, we're going to grab this guy.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m30s)

[And we are going to go here. And we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m32s)

[going to go here. And we're going to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m34s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m36s)

[And we've got branches. Find all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m40s)

[stuff. There's the one I care about.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m43s)

[Switch branch, please. Thank you. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m46s)

[then, yeah, I've already got it open.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m49s)

[Great. Okay. So if we go here and now](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m52s)

[the fact that things have passed before](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m55s)

[means that I'm I'm very confident going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h40m57s)

[into this that if I run this test in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m00s)

[isolation, it's probably about to pass.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m02s)

[We will confirm that because you should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m05s)

[always confirm that first. But the fact](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m07s)

[that I've got builds coming off of main](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m11s)

[where the thing went green, I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m13s)

[confident. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m15s)

[I'm very very confident. So, while that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m18s)

[guy is thinking about its life and what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m21s)

[it did and why it doesn't like me, let's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m23s)

[just take a quick gander. So, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m27s)

[underneath my textbox text.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m28s)

[We'll go here and we'll go here. And so,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m32s)

[this is the screenshot at the point it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m35s)

[failed. Oh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m38s)

[okay. So, there's the screenshot that it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m42s)

[took at the point of failure, which is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m44s)

[nice. The one thing I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m46s)

[immediately is I see the the underline](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m48s)

[control here. So there was some click or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m51s)

[similar and then let's take a quick](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m54s)

[gander. Um context menu get font family.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h41m56s)

[Um expected the font family to be Times](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m03s)

[New Roman but found](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m06s)

[sero UI. So this is the default WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m09s)

[font. This one terrifies me because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m12s)

[we'll look and see how this is working,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m15s)

[but this is somewhat host dependent](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m17s)

[because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m21s)

[people can add and remove fonts. And I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m23s)

[also don't see a context menu in this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m26s)

[thing here. So that's that's interesting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m29s)

[to say the least.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m32s)

[So let's see here. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m35s)

[context menu](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m38s)

[inherits font family.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m40s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m44s)

[and this guy failed on which line again?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m46s)

[Assert that context menu get font family](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m50s)

[is equal to textbox font family. That](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m53s)

[context menu is equal to textbox font](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m56s)

[family. So you'll note this is one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h42m59s)

[the things that get that is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m01s)

[about tunit and how it renders it out is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m04s)

[it literally shows me exactly where the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m07s)

[thing failed which is awesome. Um okay](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m10s)

[so that gives me](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m15s)

[the textbox font family name was Times](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m20s)

[New Roman.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m23s)

[What concerns me most is this guy here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m26s)

[We have a context menu. We rightclicked](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m30s)

[on it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m34s)

[We rightcicked on it. We grabbed the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m40s)

[context menu.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m42s)

[But clearly we didn't get the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m45s)

[context menu is not shown in this image.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m48s)

[So, I'm willing to bet the failure is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m50s)

[either this the context menu hasn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m53s)

[opened fully yet.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m56s)

[One pass and one fail.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h43m59s)

[Um, actually, you know what? The fact](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m01s)

[that this thing shows a failure is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m03s)

[interesting to me as well. Me grab this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m06s)

[Uh, actually, let's just bring you over](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m11s)

[here full screen for me for a minute.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m13s)

[Uh so the one pass one fail is kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m17s)

[artificial because this is more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m20s)

[reflective of which tests have I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m22s)

[manually run because the test runner is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m24s)

[just showing me what my executions are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m27s)

[and I haven't executed 1217 tests mostly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m29s)

[because the full suite takes like 12](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m33s)

[minutes and I don't want to wait that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m35s)

[long. Um but this one here also](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m36s)

[triggered in the same way and I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m41s)

[thinking it's because I was clicking](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m43s)

[because I believe the the code in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m48s)

[question that does this fires when the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m50s)

[context menu opens.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m53s)

[So, let me run this one more time. Hands](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m55s)

[up. Not touching anything except for my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h44m57s)

[mic. See that? That one went through and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m00s)

[passed. So, I'm willing to bet the issue](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m04s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m06s)

[either we didn't get the click going all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m09s)

[the way through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m14s)

[or something closed it even quicker. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m17s)

[tend to think we just haven't had the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m19s)

[context menu fully open and we might](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m21s)

[just need to wait for that. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m23s)

[Hey, uh increase count command execute](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m25s)

[null is the same as increase count](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m28s)

[command notify can execute change. No,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m31s)

[not quite.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m34s)

[So the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m36s)

[um it when you call execute blindly like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m38s)

[that, it will straight up invoke the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m42s)

[execute command of the of the command](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m45s)

[regardless of whether it's can execute](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m48s)

[state is true or false. So if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m50s)

[manually call the execute method](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m52s)

[directly on an I command, it will invoke](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m54s)

[it. Um the notify can execute changed.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h45m57s)

[What that does is that raises an event](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m02s)

[on the command that tells any binding on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m04s)

[the UI that's watching the command, hey,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m07s)

[you need to reinvoke my CAN execute](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m11s)

[method. So the notify can execute](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m13s)

[changed what when you invoke that what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m16s)

[you will typically see if you put a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m19s)

[break point inside your can execute](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m21s)

[method is you'll often see then an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m23s)

[invocation come back down to you from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m25s)

[the binding of the binding going well I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m27s)

[was told that my can execute method](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m29s)

[might return a different value this time](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m32s)

[let me check because that um the binding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m34s)

[doesn't know how often to call this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m37s)

[um so it calls it once when it first](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m42s)

[binds because it needs to figure out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m44s)

[what its initial state should be and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m45s)

[then it never uh invokes this again](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m47s)

[until it's given a reason to check it,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m50s)

[right? And one of the most common](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m53s)

[reasons it's given to check again is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m55s)

[uh notify can execute changed event](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h46m59s)

[being raised because if we look at um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m01s)

[increment count command right we can see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m04s)

[that there are um this event here that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m07s)

[exists on it and this is what the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m11s)

[bindings actually registering for is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m13s)

[this event. you typically don't register](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m15s)

[for this event yourself um because you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m17s)

[are often the producer of the event, not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m20s)

[necessarily the consumer. The consumer](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m22s)

[is almost always the binding out in your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m24s)

[ZAML.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m27s)

[So, if that makes sense, let me know if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m28s)

[there's any questions on that. Great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m30s)

[question, though. Great question. Okay,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m32s)

[so here I'm thinking what we want to do.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m35s)

[So, I think I actually want to change](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m38s)

[this up a little bit is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m40s)

[wait for because one of the things that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m48s)

[happened is we switched from xunit to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m51s)

[tunit and I think tunit just runs enough](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m53s)

[faster that it makes it makes a mess of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h47m57s)

[things that require timing. Um and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m01s)

[if I do return context menu get is open](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m04s)

[and do that. So the the wait for is my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m14s)

[own kind of built-in waiter thingy. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m18s)

[if you give it a boolean returning](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m21s)

[action to do it will it will wait for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m23s)

[that thing to return true otherwise it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m27s)

[throws. Um, and I think what I want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m29s)

[do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m31s)

[only interesting part is this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m33s)

[I might have to I think I have to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m36s)

[declare the context menu outside of it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m37s)

[I visual element.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m40s)

[Yeah, that thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m43s)

[Code matches appear in copilot. Yes, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m47s)

[understand. But this is my library](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m50s)

[copilot. I'm If if somebody else has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m53s)

[that in their library, they're copying](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m55s)

[me, not the other way around. Okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h48m56s)

[So, I think doing this, waiting for it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m00s)

[to be open](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m02s)

[and then grabbing it. And actually, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m04s)

[think I what I want to do is get the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m07s)

[textbox font first](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m09s)

[and actually assert on that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m13s)

[and then run this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m16s)

[because I'm willing to bet there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m18s)

[potentially and tunit is set up and and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m23s)

[this is one of the things that I've](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m26s)

[noticed that I think is potentially](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m27s)

[biting me is I think the timing of when](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m29s)

[one test finishes and the next test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m32s)

[starts. I think Tunit is just really](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m34s)

[really fast at the transition and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m36s)

[desktop window stuff just doesn't keep](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m40s)

[up. Okay, so I think that one will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m42s)

[probably fix that or at least get me](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m44s)

[closer. It'll get me into a state where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m47s)

[I need to to do it. Where's the other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m49s)

[failure?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m52s)

[Just looking for another failure.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m53s)

[There's two in this list.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h49m57s)

[Or is there two in this list? I assume](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m00s)

[there was two, but because I got two](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m03s)

[screenshots, but I'm also capturing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m05s)

[extra screenshots. Um, let's see. Only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m06s)

[one failed there. So, only one failing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m10s)

[test.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m12s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m13s)

[I may be blind, but I can't find the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m15s)

[code to do the automerge on a dependab](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m18s)

[PR. Oh, great question. Great question.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m20s)

[Let me push this real quick and then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m22s)

[boom.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m26s)

[AI, write me a good commit message.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m27s)

[Pretty please. Sounds great. Thanks.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m30s)

[So, the the bits that you are looking](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m36s)

[for, JC, and this is coming from my my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m38s)

[WPF template, but if you're looking at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m41s)

[any of my templates, you'll see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m43s)

[something similar. Um, and you'll also](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m44s)

[see it on a bunch of my repos, too. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m46s)

[down here the the things that you are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m49s)

[looking for is I have this automerge job](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m52s)

[and then specifically I am leveraging](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m56s)

[this GitHub action down here. So fastify](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h50m59s)

[is the author of it and it's GitHub](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m03s)

[action merge dependabot and the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m05s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m10s)

[if we go out and look at their repo](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m13s)

[there is yeah shut up github.com](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m17s)

[there is a handful of things that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m21s)

[actually need to be configured on your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m24s)

[repository for this thing to work. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m27s)

[so there are it's got options for if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m32s)

[just wanted to approve rather than merge](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m34s)

[and all of that stuff of and oh only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m35s)

[approve various things of that nature.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m39s)

[So there's lots of configuration out on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m42s)

[here that I am just not using. Um, but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m44s)

[if you are coming from an old version,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m48s)

[there are some permissions that need to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m49s)

[be set out here, which you'll note](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m51s)

[permissions I've got set here. Uh and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m54s)

[then you'll note that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m56s)

[um with the way I have it set up here, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h51m59s)

[am leveraging rather than it merging the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m01s)

[PR, what it's doing instead is it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m04s)

[setting automerge,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m07s)

[um which requires you to enable](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m09s)

[automerge on your GitHub repository. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m11s)

[have a PowerShell script that uses the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m14s)

[GitHub CLI or if you just go to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m16s)

[settings](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m20s)

[um there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m21s)

[um allow automerge just on the uh the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m24s)

[main general page for turning it on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m27s)

[because without this setting turned on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m29s)

[you c uh you can't set PRs to automerge.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m32s)

[Um, but once you have PR set to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m36s)

[automerge, the next thing that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m38s)

[actually need for that to work is out on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m40s)

[your branches, you need something in the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m43s)

[branch protection rules to indicate what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m46s)

[the criteria are for an automerge to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m49s)

[succeed,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m53s)

[right? And so, typically the criteria is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m54s)

[going to be, hey, did my test pass,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h52m57s)

[right? And so if you're looking at um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m01s)

[this one here um what you end up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m03s)

[specifying is the job name as the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m06s)

[criteria. So in this if you're using the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m09s)

[template the job in question would be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m12s)

[did the build job complete which this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m15s)

[maybe should be called build and test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m18s)

[build and publish because it does a it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m20s)

[does several things but this is what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m22s)

[would end up going into that spot um to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m24s)

[get the automerge working on PRs.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m28s)

[So if you're trying to just extract out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m31s)

[that little bit of the code, those are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m34s)

[all the little bits that you need and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m36s)

[then obviously the dependaboty yaml](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m38s)

[because you need dependabot running to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m40s)

[open the PRs. But usually getting that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m42s)

[much working isn't people's problem.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m44s)

[Yeah, no problem. JC, let me know if it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m46s)

[doesn't uh get working for you because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m48s)

[it it should work. Okay, let's see. That](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m49s)

[gets me there. That guy gets up and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m53s)

[running. Um I want to make sure I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m55s)

[believe it merged in. And actually, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h53m59s)

[guess I can just check it here. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m01s)

[after I pushed the release, I want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m03s)

[make sure the version number bumps](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m07s)

[happened.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m08s)

[They didn't. Didn't I open a PR for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m10s)

[that? Did it not merge?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m13s)

[Wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m17s)

[Update versions. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m19s)

[Oh, because I'm on the dependabot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m23s)

[branch. I'm not on latest. I Okay, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m25s)

[need to grab I was like, man, I could](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m28s)

[have sworn I merged the version bump.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m30s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m32s)

[there we go. Version bump is there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m34s)

[I There we go. Version bumps are all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m39s)

[done. So, I currently am tracking my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m40s)

[base versions in this getversions.yamel.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m43s)

[And then it does some wacky stuff to to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m46s)

[add in things for nightly releases and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m49s)

[that kind of thing because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m50s)

[I can't do things in an easy way. I have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m53s)

[to do them as hard as po as hard as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m55s)

[humanly possible. Okay. I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h54m58s)

[remember what was going on on this one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m00s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m03s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m07s)

[I think was this done? I think this was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m09s)

[done because I left the feedback and I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m13s)

[think Corvin's addressed it. See, that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m15s)

[fine.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m18s)

[This is just showing it in the demo app.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m19s)

[I think that's fine.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m22s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m25s)

[so we came in here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m27s)

[Yeah. And I think this was the only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m34s)

[thing that was remaining on this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m35s)

[because right here what we have and and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m39s)

[this is one of the few things that I was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m41s)

[uh watching for is and we've done this a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m44s)

[lot in our templates and I think we're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m46s)

[going to have to go back and fix several](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m48s)

[of them um is we do things like this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m49s)

[where this is fine. there's a grid and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m53s)

[inside the grid we are toggling which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m57s)

[set of controls are visible or not but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h55m59s)

[there's still functionally twice as many](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m02s)

[controls in here as what we need. Um and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m04s)

[so I think I would rather swap out the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m07s)

[content because one of the performance](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m10s)

[penalties with WPF is if you have a lot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m12s)

[of extra items in your template](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m15s)

[those start to add up especially if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m18s)

[somebody does something crazy like puts](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m20s)

[them inside of a list or similar. Now,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m22s)

[this is a tab control. It's probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m24s)

[never going to be in a list, but I still](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m25s)

[think it's worth potentially cleaning](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m28s)

[up. I'll leave that one sit for the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m29s)

[moment. Um, let's see. Ooh, I want to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m31s)

[through and look at this one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m34s)

[This is one I would like to go and look](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m37s)

[at. Um, let me grab this one because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m39s)

[this this is a cool one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m43s)

[This is a cool one. Uh, add remote and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m46s)

[checkout, please.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m50s)

[So this is a uh yeah sure fine reset my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m52s)

[master to there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h56m56s)

[So this is porting over](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m01s)

[for people who because I I briefly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m04s)

[looked at this. So this is material uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m06s)

[uh color utilities from the material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m11s)

[foundation and porting this into net.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m13s)

[And the idea here is being able to have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m15s)

[almost a nice](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m19s)

[color scheme builderish](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m22s)

[of being able to go through and do this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m25s)

[There was some really interesting bits](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m28s)

[of code of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m30s)

[uh disliked colors. Like there was a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m32s)

[reference to a book that I then had to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m36s)

[go and look up all on uh color theory](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m38s)

[and the psychology of different colors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m42s)

[of how certain colors are generally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m44s)

[universally disliked, which I nearly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m46s)

[died laughing. So like the the yellowy](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m48s)

[brown color is one that was called out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m51s)

[as kind of a universally disliked color.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m53s)

[Um because it's often associated with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m55s)

[like rotting food and and that kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m57s)

[thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h57m59s)

[Um, and then that same week, one of our](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m01s)

[designers at work made a similar comment](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m05s)

[on on how yellow was was ugly and she](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m07s)

[didn't like using it, and I nearly died](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m10s)

[laughing. I'm like, I know why. I've got](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m12s)

[it. I've got it. I get it. I get it now.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m14s)

[It was It was kind of funny. It I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m16s)

[thought that was I thought that was](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m19s)

[hilarious. Um, and I learned a ton on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m21s)

[color theory. So, two birds, one stone.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m23s)

[So, let's relaunch this because I want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m26s)

[to take a look. There was a lot of code](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m28s)

[in here. Um, and I wanted to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m31s)

[check it because it's it's in here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m37s)

[And there is, as you can see, there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m41s)

[mass amounts of code for the test for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m45s)

[the utilities. And I don't remember if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m48s)

[this was used anywhere outside of this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m51s)

[because again this is a straight port of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h58m56s)

[Yeah, this this one. Um what is it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m00s)

[flagging here?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m03s)

[Oh, interesting. Okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m07s)

[Oh, because it's on a dislike folder and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m10s)

[it doesn't have it here. Like is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m12s)

[disliked. Return true if a color is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m13s)

[disliked.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m16s)

[like that is just an awesome function](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m18s)

[can like I have to agree that that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m20s)

[fairly cool. Now I do wonder and so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m23s)

[there's there's a problem that I have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m27s)

[been struggling with and I don't know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m29s)

[how to solve it and I think this pro](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m31s)

[this library probably makes it worse but](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m32s)

[we have the material design colors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m35s)

[repository and the history on this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m36s)

[this was built way back when the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m39s)

[original author was working on it with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m41s)

[the intent of at the time he was adding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m44s)

[in more of the material design color](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m47s)

[themes and he wanted to be able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m49s)

[release this independently with updated](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m50s)

[color themes that people to just pull in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m53s)

[and release uh willy-nilly. However,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m55s)

[with all of the changes that I've done,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=01h59m58s)

[the coupling is kind of tight and it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m00s)

[been years since we've released the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m04s)

[colors library or the MA apps library](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m06s)

[without a main library update, which is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m09s)

[why all the version numbers are now in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m11s)

[sync. And so, I've been very tempted to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m13s)

[collapse the colors library into the WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m16s)

[library. the only thing that's kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m19s)

[stopping me, like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m22s)

[it's already a W. It's not like somebody](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m24s)

[could use this outside of WPF anyway.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m27s)

[And so it's like, boy, do I just flatten](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m30s)

[those things together and have it all in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m33s)

[the box so it's one Nougat package](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m35s)

[instead of two? It's tempting. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m36s)

[really tempting. Um, slightly smaller](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m39s)

[download if we do that, but possibly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m42s)

[breaking because I'm going to hose](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m45s)

[everybody's namespace references. That's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m47s)

[less good. Um, but yeah, this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m50s)

[this guy here and I'm curious. I want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m55s)

[know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h00m59s)

[did he](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m00s)

[library creates a colors according to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m04s)

[this system.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m07s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m09s)

[I wanted to see uh MRI 69, thank you for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m11s)

[the follow. I appreciate it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m15s)

[I wanted to see if there was a reference](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m17s)

[in here outside of the library because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m20s)

[most of this is just straight new code.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m26s)

[Yeah, I don't think it's actually in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m30s)

[here. Why is there an X next to this? Is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m32s)

[it because one of the tests in here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m35s)

[failed?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m36s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m39s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m43s)

[That's kind of cool. Um, and there's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m46s)

[things like this where there's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m48s)

[directory packages prop. Oh, I guess](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m49s)

[this is this isn't inside the folder.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m52s)

[Okay, so this is just bringing in these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m54s)

[with some polyfills](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h01m57s)

[and a math shim. That's okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m01s)

[I wonder](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m06s)

[this is labeled as a shim, but I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m09s)

[know that this is actually available. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m11s)

[I don't when I look at shim I'm usually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m14s)

[picturing something that is being added](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m17s)

[in to um meet multiple frameworks right](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m19s)

[like a new new API is added in net 9 and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m24s)

[so we shim in an equivalent one in net 8](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m28s)

[so that we can use it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m30s)

[this feels like more of a just a helper](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m33s)

[but that's a nitpick uh let's see does](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m36s)

[it consider certain shades of red had](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m38s)

[one guy who always reacted strangely to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m40s)

[error validation messages in an app.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m42s)

[Turns out anything too close to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m45s)

[color of blood hay blood made him](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m47s)

[queasy. So we had to make the red a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m51s)

[little more orange pinkish. Oh, that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m53s)

[interesting. That's very interesting.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m55s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h02m59s)

[the answer is maybe. Um and and this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m01s)

[why I wanted to look at this because and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m04s)

[I may merge this because it's all net](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m06s)

[new code.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m09s)

[It's all net new code. like it's adding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m11s)

[the library stuff in.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m14s)

[It's not referenced anywhere else](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m18s)

[and it's still on on us to actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m23s)

[bring it into the library.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m26s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m31s)

[because like all of this bit still would](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m33s)

[need to be implemented.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m36s)

[Yeah, cuz the material design bits like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m39s)

[for people who haven't seen it like the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m42s)

[Google engineers give a very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m45s)

[simplified version around color system](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m48s)

[and the way to think about it like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m52s)

[designers a a good designer is awesome,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m54s)

[right? I think there's a lot of mediocre](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h03m58s)

[designers, but a good designer with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m01s)

[knowledge of like color theory and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m02s)

[otherwise is amazing,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m05s)

[right? of being able to go through and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m08s)

[um measure all of this. Like when I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m11s)

[implemented some of the like the auto um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m14s)

[the auto color adjustments for making](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m19s)

[sure that there was an appropriate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m22s)

[contrast between your foreground and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m24s)

[your background for the text. Um, which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m26s)

[that's something I I should maybe I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m28s)

[should add that to the should probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m30s)

[add that to my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m33s)

[template. So, for people who haven't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m35s)

[seen it, I'll just highlight that real](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m37s)

[quick.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m40s)

[Um, it's this color adjust option here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m42s)

[So this color adjust basically um tells](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m46s)

[the material design color theming that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m50s)

[you are okay allowing it to adjust your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m53s)

[background and foreground colors to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m56s)

[ensure a readable contrast ratio. So it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h04m58s)

[says that effectively when you turn this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m02s)

[on it says I care more about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m04s)

[accessibility than my exact colors. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m06s)

[let's use this. Izzy, have a good one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m10s)

[And yes, I hope you have a very](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m13s)

[uneventful Friday and no more curveballs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m15s)

[thrown at you. Um, so if you care more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m18s)

[about accessibility than exact colors,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m21s)

[this is a nice option to turn on,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m23s)

[especially if you allow your users to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m25s)

[tweak their theme colors or you're using](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m27s)

[say inherit, right? Because you can we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m30s)

[can now we now allow inherit on your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m33s)

[secondary color to pull in the Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m35s)

[color. And since you may not know what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m37s)

[your secondary color is, how do you know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m39s)

[what the appropriate foreground color is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m41s)

[to place on top of it? User may have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m43s)

[picked any number of things. So, no](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m45s)

[releasing 531 or later. Don't worry.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m48s)

[Don't worry. There there's nothing in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m51s)

[531 yet. So, you're you're safe for now.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m53s)

[Um unless unless a bug or something a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m56s)

[big bug or something creeps up, I'm I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h05m59s)

[probably hold it for a little bit and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m02s)

[just see. I try not to hold them too](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m04s)

[long, but I held the last one like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m05s)

[months months longer than I should have](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m07s)

[because I was threatening to release 530](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m10s)

[before I before the start of summer and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m12s)

[it's the end of summer and I finally](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m14s)

[kicked it. So, I need to trust my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m16s)

[pipeline more. So, I'm kind of tempted](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m18s)

[to just let this one come in. Just go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m20s)

[over this. Colors are represented as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m24s)

[signed 32-bit integers instead of uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m25s)

[system windows color. Uh while](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m28s)

[conversion is easily possible, the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m30s)

[question is if we should only use a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m32s)

[conversion at the board of the library](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m34s)

[or also replace int with color for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m36s)

[internal usage and break with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m38s)

[original source. That is a great](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m40s)

[question. So the idea here for people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m42s)

[who uh aren't familiar with it uh system](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m46s)

[windows color, right? If we go and take](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m49s)

[a quick gander at it, we can we can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m51s)

[actually just jump into this, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m55s)

[Right. So, if we go in here and do uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h06m58s)

[system windows color](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m00s)

[uh uh oh, this isn't a WPF library.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m05s)

[That's why. Let's go into the colors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m09s)

[one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m11s)

[System windows color.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m16s)

[What? Where is color? Am I Am I crazy?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m18s)

[System Windows media color. There we go.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m22s)

[Right. So if we look at this guy here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m26s)

[this guy is just a strruct](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m28s)

[with kind of the values that you would](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m33s)

[expect, right? A RGB because that is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m35s)

[color space that the the built-in one um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m39s)

[works off of. And you do have the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m42s)

[source RGB which is uh your floats to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m45s)

[range from 0 to one. But functionally,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m49s)

[if you have an int an integer, that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m51s)

[four bytes.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m55s)

[Right. So, you have you have the same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m56s)

[number of bits in an integer as you do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h07m58s)

[an ARGB.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m02s)

[Hey cutie, welcome.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m04s)

[How did your stream go? Hopefully, well,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m08s)

[um, so you have the same number of bits](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m14s)

[in an integer as you do an ARGB color](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m17s)

[because they both have 32 bits because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m20s)

[these can only go up to 0 to 255. So the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m22s)

[question being proposed is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m25s)

[do we expose it as a color or do we make](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m29s)

[it an integer and that is a good](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m30s)

[question. I am](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m32s)

[tempted to say use a color because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m35s)

[that's what most things coming in as. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m38s)

[think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m41s)

[um let's see unit tests don't have 100%](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m43s)

[coverage and have multiple asserts per](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m46s)

[test. While this makes it align with the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m47s)

[original source code. I'd consider it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m49s)

[bad practice to score uh to structure](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m50s)

[unit tests like this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m53s)

[Yes. Though like I said earlier, I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m55s)

[subscribe to the single assert. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h08m58s)

[subscribe to the single logical assert](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m01s)

[per test. So we may take a quick quick](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m02s)

[gander on it. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m05s)

[stream was fun. Games were awful. Oh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m09s)

[come on. I I vaguely recall listening in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m11s)

[at one point of you saying it seemed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m14s)

[almost too easy. So you must have had](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m16s)

[one easy win at least. Uh we are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m17s)

[currently looking at my material design](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m20s)

[library and specifically a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m22s)

[um a PR that a wonderful gentleman made](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m26s)

[that adds a nice bit of color utility](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m31s)

[stuff.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m34s)

[So I get to masquerade as somebody who](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m35s)

[knows color theory.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m38s)

[And my Mountain Dew is empty. So hang](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m41s)

[on. Reloading.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m43s)

[I caught the one game that wasn't a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m46s)

[disaster. Oh, sure.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m48s)

[H That's why that's why you got to play](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m54s)

[something other than support so that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m56s)

[can actually um complain about your back](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h09m58s)

[hurting from carrying the team. Um okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m00s)

[Yeah. So, there there's a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m04s)

[stuff in here and like the color tool](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m06s)

[that I have built in, right? Like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m07s)

[there's the built-in material design.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m10s)

[Whoa. Hey.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m12s)

[Wow. I did not know. Okay. bad windows,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m14s)

[knock it off. So, there's like the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m17s)

[built-in material design pallet colors,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m19s)

[which is all the the ones that the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m21s)

[material design 2spec does, but we also](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m24s)

[have like this custom colory thingy](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m27s)

[mabber where you can do all kinds of fun](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m30s)

[fun things and, you know, dial in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m33s)

[exactly where you want it to be. Cuz](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m36s)

[this is a an HLS color picker that's um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m38s)

[I don't remember. I cleaned up some bugs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m43s)

[with it, but I don't think I actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m45s)

[wrote it. I think one of the other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m47s)

[contributors actually built it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m48s)

[Um, and it's I do find it interesting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h10m57s)

[here. It's got color adjust turned on.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m00s)

[Oh, there it is. Oh, so with color](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m07s)

[adjust turned on, right, you'll see the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m10s)

[the actual color is this darker blue,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m12s)

[but with color adjust on, it's adjusting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m14s)

[it to keep the um the foreground](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m16s)

[readable. So no matter how dark you go,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m18s)

[it's not going to let you go too dark](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m21s)

[because otherwise your dark text doesn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m23s)

[become visible.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m25s)

[So it is an interesting one. I do wonder](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m27s)

[it might be interesting to add a feature](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m31s)

[in where we invert the color adjust. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m33s)

[rather than adjusting the theme color,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m36s)

[um, you can specify color adjust on like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m40s)

[a a a text block and have it adjust the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m43s)

[foreground instead. That might be a nice](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m47s)

[feature.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m49s)

[That could be an interesting feature.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m53s)

[That way it can go through and tweak it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m54s)

[The the hard part about doing it at a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m56s)

[individual element level is you have to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h11m58s)

[be able to know what the background is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m01s)

[and that's not always trivial.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m03s)

[because you you either have to like hit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m06s)

[test and grab pixels off the background](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m09s)

[and you have to assume solid color and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m11s)

[there's a there's a bunch of assumptions](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m13s)

[to make but I do wonder if maybe there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m15s)

[was an attach property that did it. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m17s)

[let's see with the color tool there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m24s)

[doesn't seem to be a this is the result](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m26s)

[and this is how you use it or I am](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m28s)

[missing it. You are correct. The only](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m31s)

[thing that's actually in here is this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m34s)

[color hex value. The how you use it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m36s)

[comes from somewhat knowing that you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m40s)

[use this custom color theme like this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m43s)

[guy here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m46s)

[And the the custom color theme allows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m49s)

[you to specify the RGB values that you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m51s)

[want for your primary and secondary.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m54s)

[So you are correct that that is not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m56s)

[called out very well. That's one thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h12m59s)

[that I've uh and maybe I'll ask you JC](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m01s)

[what you think about this. There are a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m05s)

[couple controls that we've started doing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m07s)

[differently.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m09s)

[Like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m10s)

[this control here, you basically get to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m12s)

[see all of your options on the right and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m15s)

[then you can start playing around with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m17s)

[them to see, you know, what do I like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m18s)

[better, right? what what makes more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m21s)

[sense to me of doing this versus some of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m24s)

[the ones like this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m28s)

[where it's kind of just a gallery layout](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m32s)

[of all the things and you just scroll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m34s)

[until you see something you like and you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m36s)

[go, "Ooh, that's pretty. What does that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m38s)

[look like?" Right? So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m39s)

[I like there's benefits to both ways of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m43s)

[doing it and I a lot of other libraries](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m46s)

[seem to favor going more this approach](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m50s)

[where but I'm I'm kind of wondering if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m55s)

[maybe we have like a single page where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h13m57s)

[you pick a control and then you get your](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m00s)

[properties list on the right of what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m02s)

[that control can do. That way for people](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m05s)

[who want that, you can have this. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m08s)

[then for everyone else, there's kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m10s)

[a gallery one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m13s)

[Yeah, I like the gallery cuz I'm bad at](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m17s)

[designing and don't know what looks](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m18s)

[good. Yeah, it's See, and I honestly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m20s)

[kind of like the gallery, too, because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m23s)

[like especially with like the buttons, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m27s)

[usually come in here and go, hm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m29s)

[h](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m32s)

[I like that one.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m34s)

[And like that's the whole point of these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m37s)

[like I know it's it's kind of hard to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m39s)

[see on a dark screen, but that's the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m41s)

[whole point of these little arrows here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m42s)

[is this is a library that I wrote called](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m44s)

[show me the ZAML.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m47s)

[Um that literally just does this so that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m49s)

[you can see what is the source ZAML for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m52s)

[doing this. And I I laughed at one point](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m55s)

[because the Uno the Uno team actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m57s)

[forked it and they have something](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h14m59s)

[similar in their demo app because they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m01s)

[apparently liked it so much. So, I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m02s)

[thought that was hilarious. I was like,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m05s)

["Yay, they made somebody found it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m07s)

[useful."](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m10s)

[Uh, single item gallery on the left with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m11s)

[a chosen control in the middle and props](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m13s)

[on the right. Yeah, it could be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m15s)

[something like that. And and I do wonder](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m17s)

[because it feels like I almost want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m20s)

[some way of doing that kind of thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m24s)

[Um, the hard part is not all the things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m27s)

[are props, right? like some of them are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m30s)

[different styles, but even on like that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m32s)

[popup control,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m34s)

[right? Like it does give you a style](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m37s)

[drop down. So, we could get away with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m39s)

[it, right? Depending on on which which](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m41s)

[of the styles you wanted to do because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m43s)

[it is hard because you do you wouldn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m45s)

[want a gallery view showing you every](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m47s)

[possible elevation value. That just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m49s)

[yuck. Like if I want if I want to see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m52s)

[what a 24 looks like and on a dark theme](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m55s)

[it's really hard to see the difference.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h15m58s)

[So, let's go light theme, right? So, if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m00s)

[I go here and do something like DP](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m02s)

[elevation zero. Oh, interesting.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m05s)

[Wonder if the elevation isn't respected](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m09s)

[by this style](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m11s)

[or if the elevation is only used on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m15s)

[popup.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m17s)

[Let's see. The elevation only used on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m19s)

[the Oh, the elevation's only used on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m21s)

[content, not on the popup it or the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m23s)

[button itself. That's interesting. That](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m26s)

[feels like something I I wonder if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m28s)

[that's just an artifact of us not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m31s)

[exposing an extra elevation property or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m32s)

[otherwise. H because I kind of expected](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m34s)

[when I did this that because you can see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m37s)

[the the shadow here and the elevation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m39s)

[and that to me looks like I don't know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m41s)

[68 maybe. And so when I set it to 24, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m43s)

[expect a vastly different thing. But](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m47s)

[when it's applying to the content and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m48s)

[only applying in a certain area, I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m51s)

[the floating action pop-up box is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m53s)

[probably just disregarding this. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m55s)

[yeah, there's there's some there's some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h16m58s)

[work to be done around making this um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m00s)

[demo app a little more helpful to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m04s)

[people. Even your comment too, JC, about](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m08s)

[hey, on the color tool, it doesn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m10s)

[really show me how to use it. Um, I kind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m13s)

[of want to change out the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m16s)

[the color tool page for something that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m20s)

[more like a a theme builder because I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m22s)

[think that's what people really want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m25s)

[use it for is they want to they they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m27s)

[want to build something that generate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m30s)

[that that shows them the ZAML that they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m32s)

[can paste into their app.zaml like this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m34s)

[and go and you're good, right? They want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m37s)

[something that generates into this and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m40s)

[either gives them a bundled theme or a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m42s)

[custom color theme and and lets them](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m44s)

[decide on all the stuff. And I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m46s)

[yes, theme builder, please. And the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m49s)

[other thing that's technically possible](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m51s)

[and not really exposed here that I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m53s)

[would be better with a theme builder is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m55s)

[we switched back on the 50 release, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h17m59s)

[think. Um, and we actually have a we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m03s)

[started breaking out all of the brushes.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m07s)

[So, I have a is it the pallet.json? No,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m10s)

[theme colors. I have this JSON file that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m14s)

[is used as the source of some codegen](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m17s)

[um that documents out all of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m21s)

[brushes. And so if you want to go in and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m24s)

[say, I don't want to just set my primary](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m27s)

[and secondary. I want to tweak the um a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m29s)

[very specific, you know, the the button](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m33s)

[ripple brush.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m36s)

[You can go through and tweak just that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m38s)

[one brush and have it work, right? The](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m41s)

[problem is to do that requires you to a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m44s)

[know about the brush and and b go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m46s)

[through and tweak it. And so I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m49s)

[thinking that on like a theme builder, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m51s)

[would I would gen part of the theme](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m52s)

[builder to build out one of these](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m55s)

[themes.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m57s)

[Yeah, you could have this uh like the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h18m58s)

[pop-up thing for buttons and then some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m01s)

[examples on the left to scroll through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m02s)

[when clicking on examples. Change the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m04s)

[properties to the example. Best of both](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m05s)

[worlds, I guess. Yeah. And I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m07s)

[that's kind of the the picture I had in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m09s)

[my head when JC was saying like single](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m11s)

[item gallery on the left, chosen control](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m15s)

[in the middle, and props on the right.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m17s)

[That's kind of the picture that I that I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m18s)

[drew in there. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m21s)

[let's see. 530 adding numeric up down in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m26s)

[an empty project gives binding errors.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m28s)

[Something related to automation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m32s)

[properties.name. Ooh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m33s)

[okay. Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m36s)

[I assume you're is that a default style](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m39s)

[for it or did you specify a style on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m42s)

[that one? Hessen Hessen.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m45s)

[Let's see here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m49s)

[Elemento default style. Okay. Uh okay.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m52s)

[So where is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h19m58s)

[automation properties name?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m02s)

[So there is a binding path on the hint](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m07s)

[assist](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m12s)

[but you said on an empty project](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m18s)

[is the issue here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m21s)

[Oh.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m26s)

[H.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m31s)

[That's not great.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m33s)

[That's not great. So, I think the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m37s)

[problem that's probably coming in here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m40s)

[with the binding error is I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m42s)

[bet hint assist.hint is probably unset,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m44s)

[leaving you to null or dependency](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m48s)

[property unset value.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m50s)

[And automation properties.name name](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m53s)

[wants a string.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m55s)

[I don't believe it supports anything](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m58s)

[else. Yeah. So, it's a type of string.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h20m59s)

[So, we've got a problem here in that we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m02s)

[are binding this guy through.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m07s)

[And this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m14s)

[this is an awkward one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m17s)

[because on one hand we really want to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m20s)

[try to make the automation stuff work](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m22s)

[nicely for people who do UI tests.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m24s)

[But this is one of those cases where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m30s)

[it's really hard to get right. So the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m31s)

[reason hint is hint hint assist hint.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m33s)

[Wow. Okay. Let's try this again.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m37s)

[Okay, Mountain Dew. Good. Um, the reason](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m41s)

[hint assist hint um is problematic or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m45s)

[set to an object is because it allows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m48s)

[you to put arbitrary content in there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m50s)

[You could slap in an image if you wanted](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m52s)

[as part of your your hint. I I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m54s)

[think that's a great idea. But for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m57s)

[example, we also have like the pack icon](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h21m59s)

[class for doing icons. And it would not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m01s)

[be unreasonable for somebody to say,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m03s)

["Oh, well, as part of my little hint, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m05s)

[want to have an icon and some text."](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m08s)

[Great, fine. Have at it. Slap a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m10s)

[grid or stack panel in there, and you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m12s)

[off to the races.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m13s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m15s)

[I am tempted to just strip this out](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m17s)

[completely. I I vaguely recall a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m22s)

[discussion on this though. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m26s)

[let me go back and look at the history.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m31s)

[Uh, numeric up down up down not there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m33s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m39s)

[Yeah, cuz I remember there was a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m43s)

[discussion on this particular one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m45s)

[and I'm wondering if we have the same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m54s)

[problem in other cases. The other thing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m56s)

[that we could do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h22m58s)

[because we added this on multiple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m02s)

[controls,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m04s)

[the other thing we could do, and I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m09s)

[what's probably biting us is we could go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m12s)

[through I I um let me see if I can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m16s)

[replicate this real quick on my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m18s)

[sample project.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m22s)

[Uh let's see. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m24s)

[because I can probably replicate that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m27s)

[pretty easy by just changing this to a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m29s)

[530.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m31s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m33s)

[close all U. Close all you. Close all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m35s)

[you. And then we'll go here. We'll go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m37s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m39s)

[We'll do uh oh, I don't have the name](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m41s)

[space for material design yet. I should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m45s)

[add that into my](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m47s)

[template.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m49s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m52s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m54s)

[Put it there. And then we will do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h23m55s)

[uh matern](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m01s)

[up down.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m11s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m14s)

[wow. No, I just I want No, co-pilot,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m17s)

[stop. Okay, you're not you're not being](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m22s)

[helpful anymore. You're not being](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m24s)

[helpful. There you go. There you go.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m26s)

[Nice region. Yeah, I know.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m31s)

[Sometimes co-pilot's helpful. Other](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m34s)

[times I insult it using colorful Latin](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m36s)

[and old English. Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m40s)

[what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m46s)

[value of collection UI element](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m48s)

[collection is string to UI. What did I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m50s)

[do wrong? Or more accurately co-pilot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m52s)

[what did you do wrong?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m54s)

[Oh um you didn't properly terminate the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h24m56s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m00s)

[that no workie write valid XML copilot.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m02s)

[Okay. So we go there, we go there and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m08s)

[there in fact is the binding air](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m12s)

[value no cannot be assigned to property](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m17s)

[blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m19s)

[and you are correct automation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m25s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m27s)

[name and I I'm willing to bet a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m29s)

[workaround for this would be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m32s)

[uh hint assist hint](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m35s)

[empty string. I bet you that cuts one of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m39s)

[the war or one of the binding errors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m42s)

[out.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m44s)

[Look at that. Fixes it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m49s)

[So I think the solution here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m52s)

[and we'll just So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h25m56s)

[I I think what I want to do for this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m00s)

[something like setter property.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m02s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m05s)

[uh, let's see here. And I want to go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m07s)

[with WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m09s)

[intest](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m11s)

[value gets empty string](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m18s)

[because doing this allows it to have a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m22s)

[value.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m27s)

[Oh, I guess here I don't want the PNS on](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m29s)

[it, do I? I want this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m32s)

[And then that should compile](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m35s)

[because that should get it set to a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m39s)

[default one. The the problem I have is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m42s)

[if you change it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m44s)

[if you change it to an object, it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m50s)

[still going to fail.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m52s)

[It's still going to fail.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m55s)

[I'm wondering if it's better to value](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h26m59s)

[converter it instead.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m01s)

[Okay, let's test that. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m06s)

[okay, let's go back to my sample app](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m09s)

[because for example, right, if rather](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m13s)

[than just doing empty string, if we do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m14s)

[something more like this, right? Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m17s)

[let's see, uh, material](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m21s)

[design. You'd think I'd learn after all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m25s)

[these years how to actually type it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m27s)

[right? And I do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m38s)

[uh text block text set count, right? So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m41s)

[that is that is very much not a string,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m45s)

[right? I think I probably still end up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m48s)

[with the with a binding error here, too.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m51s)

[No, I don't.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m54s)

[It's only unhappy when it's unset.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h27m57s)

[How very very interesting.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m02s)

[Why is it okay with that?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m08s)

[Snoop, I need you. Come here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m11s)

[Why is it okay with that? Because that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m17s)

[not a string.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m19s)

[Ignore those binding errors. Those are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m21s)

[triggered by snoop. Um, but what I want](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m23s)

[to know is the numeric updown](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m27s)

[this is why I'm wondering if this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m44s)

[what we really want.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m46s)

[Check the hint being set. Yeah. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m51s)

[that's why I'm thinking what I almost](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m53s)

[want to do is value converter it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m54s)

[I think I want to value converter it. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h28m59s)

[let's let's Okay, we're going to test](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m02s)

[this theory. So if I go](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m05s)

[cuz this is this is the guy here, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m10s)

[I want this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m12s)

[Come here. Come here, you big ugly.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m14s)

[I want this and I want this binding.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m18s)

[going to recreate the binding here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m23s)

[Right. So, this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m25s)

[functionally what I want and this needs](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m28s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m30s)

[material design.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m34s)

[Okay. But I think what I want to build](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m38s)

[here is I want a Oh, I guess I can use](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m41s)

[the new button up here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m44s)

[Is it this?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m47s)

[Yeah. Add new item. Show compact view uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m49s)

[string value converter.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m52s)

[Thank you.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m56s)

[I value converter. Boom. Boom. Boom. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h29m59s)

[then public. And then control RG. Format](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m04s)

[all the things. File scope to name](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m07s)

[space. Implement the interface.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m09s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m11s)

[yeah, I don't trust Copilot to do it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m14s)

[So, and then I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m16s)

[is something like if value is string](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m17s)

[return](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m22s)

[uh value else return](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m24s)

[I think I actually want dependency](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m28s)

[property unset value.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m29s)

[So this is a magical value that if it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m34s)

[comes through a binding](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m36s)

[um it will set the property back to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m38s)

[whatever its default is. So for example,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m40s)

[if we look at automation property.name,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m45s)

[um, oh, it doesn't show me here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m50s)

[is when you declare your, uh, static](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m54s)

[dependency property, you declare what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m57s)

[the default is for the value. And so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h30m59s)

[sending unset value effectively sends it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m01s)

[back to the default. Um, for a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m04s)

[things, for like strings, it's typically](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m07s)

[null. For like doubles, for size and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m09s)

[whatnot, it's typically double.n. nan,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m11s)

[not a number.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m14s)

[Um, but I think what I want to do here](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m16s)

[then is let's go up here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m18s)

[let's see. Converter](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m43s)

[from this?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m47s)

[Too slow. Copilot. Too slow. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m49s)

[now if I launch, I expect](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m52s)

[that I'm hitting this. And I should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m56s)

[probably set a breakpoint just to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m58s)

[confirm, but I'm kind of wondering if I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h31m59s)

[put a converter equivalent of this in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m01s)

[the library. So, see, we're fine there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m04s)

[Um, and if I look at its automation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m08s)

[property, I'm hoping it's, you know,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m10s)

[null or unset or similar. So, numeric](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m14s)

[Great. Binding error get error message.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m20s)

[That's not helpful.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m24s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m29s)

[wow. We've got a lot.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m37s)

[Uh, prevent local brushes to keep the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m42s)

[designer sign maintainable.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m44s)

[Um, interesting. So, we've got a couple](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m47s)

[of those that we may want to clean up.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m50s)

[And then we may want to start freezing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m52s)

[some things because apparently we got a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m54s)

[bunch of unfrozen brushes.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m55s)

[Um, but some of these might actually be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h32m58s)

[Snoop itself because I'm looking at like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m01s)

[light red hyphen 75. That isn't me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m03s)

[Um, but what is the binding error in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m07s)

[question here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m10s)

[right? So where is the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m13s)

[null cannot be assigned](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m22s)

[automations property name?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m27s)

[Interesting. Why does it think that it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m34s)

[null? So, hypothetically, if we dial](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m37s)

[back this down to empty string, let's do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m40s)

[this because I do want to make sure if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m44s)

[brushes are frozen, um, can they even](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m47s)

[paint? Yes. So, a frozen brush,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m49s)

[um, so WPF was written back at the same](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m53s)

[time that uh, was it .NET 3 or .NET 35](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h33m58s)

[was being built? I don't remember. It](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m02s)

[was in that time frame, 2005. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m04s)

[immutability wasn't really a thing that](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m08s)

[they had to work with. Their only way of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m10s)

[doing immutable was kind of with like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m12s)

[strrus or otherwise like like there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m15s)

[there was no built-in firstparty](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m17s)

[support. If you wanted it, you had to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m18s)

[build it. Um, and the thing with brushes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m20s)

[and similar is you want a brush to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m23s)

[mutable while you're configuring it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m25s)

[Like a gradient brush, you want to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m27s)

[able to assign to all of its properties](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m29s)

[to say, "Oh, make the gradient go from](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m30s)

[here to here." And trying to make it all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m32s)

[set up front. Um because bear in mind](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m35s)

[they didn't have things like init](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m37s)

[properties or otherwise to work with. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m38s)

[it was like h that API kind of sucks. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m40s)

[um they](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m44s)

[they went through and said well](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m47s)

[immutability gives us a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m50s)

[performance. So we want things to become](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m51s)

[immutable. And so for things like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m54s)

[brushes if they are frozen um it just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h34m57s)

[means that their properties can't be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m00s)

[changed. And so they get the benefits of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m02s)

[immutability because then you know](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m04s)

[caching similar um can be leveraged and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m06s)

[abused. So that's the that's the warning](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m10s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m12s)

[is there um is there effectively](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m14s)

[something that can be frozen? And if you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m18s)

[typically with brushes once you create](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m22s)

[them you probably want to freeze them](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m24s)

[because there you often aren't mutating](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m26s)

[them after the fact. And if you're](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m28s)

[using, sometimes people leave them](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m30s)

[unfrozen for animations, which is fine.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m32s)

[Um, but you can actually animate between](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m35s)

[brushes, which is usually slightly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m38s)

[better, but uh context dependent.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m40s)

[Okay. So, I want to look at this now. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m45s)

[want to make sure you don't show a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m48s)

[you immediately flagged a handful of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m52s)

[those. The the reason I'm not as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m54s)

[concerned with the binding errors is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m56s)

[Snoop when it fires up, it iterates](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h35m58s)

[through every object and well, I should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m00s)

[say every object when you navigate in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m02s)

[here, it's ripping through all of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m04s)

[properties on these things. And so](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m06s)

[sometimes calling a properties getter](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m09s)

[triggers more binding errors because it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m11s)

[doesn't it doesn't know what it should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m14s)

[or shouldn't do. It just grabs all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m15s)

[things. Okay, so this is no longer an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m17s)

[error. If we just go empty string for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m20s)

[automation property.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m23s)

[So maybe what we need is a converter for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m25s)

[automation property name.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m27s)

[I think that's I think that's probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m32s)

[better](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m34s)

[is something simple like this because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m38s)

[that's the case where it's an object.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m42s)

[But if I go through and I do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m45s)

[right. So we're going to comment this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m48s)

[for a moment. But if I do uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m50s)

[let's see hint assist hint set count](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m55s)

[right in this case I would expect](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h36m59s)

[it's interesting because the hint isn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h37m09s)

[text box has to have a style that would](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h37m41s)

[leverage it. Nested textbox style.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h37m44s)

[um textbox base I think we can get into](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h37m54s)

[here into here and somewhere in here I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h37m57s)

[believe the hint actually makes its way](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m01s)

[of the issue is that there so there is a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m07s)

[smart hint in there](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m12s)

[because I see the hint is sense opacity,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m15s)

[converter, offset, margin. There's the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m18s)

[hint itself, and there's the hint assist](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m21s)

[hint. So, it gets in there. What's a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m23s)

[snoop? Oh, great question. This little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m26s)

[thing. This is one of my favorite](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m29s)

[things. Um, and apparently when I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m32s)

[reorganized my stuff, my browser closed.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m35s)

[Uh, so that's exciting. GitHub Snoop.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m37s)

[So, you got to put the word GitHub in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m41s)

[front of your query, otherwise you end](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m43s)

[up with Snoopy or Snoop Dog. And neither](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m44s)

[Uh well, at least I've gotten no help](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m49s)

[from either of those with my WPF. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m51s)

[this is a little um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m53s)

[uh inspector utility. Um Bastion Smith](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h38m57s)

[is a say a popular WPF developer. Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m01s)

[he's got several really cool WPF](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m06s)

[libraries, so feel free to poke around](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m08s)

[on his other stuff. but it's a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m10s)

[your WPF apps to look at all the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m15s)

[elements. It's very similar to like what](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m18s)

[web developers are used to with their](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m20s)

[dev tools where they can kind of poke](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m22s)

[through the DOM and see all the elements](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m24s)

[and the CSS and the styling. Snoop is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m26s)

[effectively the same type of thing. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m29s)

[know their Peanuts lore. Is that a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m56s)

[thing? Feels like it's a thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h39m59s)

[Um, so I think that's probably the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m02s)

[solution here is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m05s)

[we probably want an automation prop a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m08s)

[converter that leverages this cuz I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m11s)

[don't know if I like this as setting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m16s)

[this here as much as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m18s)

[falling back on it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m22s)

[Is this one inheritable?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m28s)

[it does inherit. Oh, that's even more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m30s)

[interesting. So, when you set the the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m33s)

[property metadata inherits, what this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m36s)

[means is you don't have to set it on the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m38s)

[element where you want it. You can set](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m41s)

[it on any parent and it'll propagate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m42s)

[down.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m45s)

[Or another way to say it, a child](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m47s)

[inherits this value from its parent. And](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m49s)

[so, you can set it on any parent and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m52s)

[it'll propagate in, which is a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m54s)

[weird.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m56s)

[It's a little weird, but I like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h40m57s)

[but it's likely there so that we don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m02s)

[have to remember to forward it in all](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m04s)

[cases because if you don't have inherit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m06s)

[turned on, you then have to make sure to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m08s)

[template bind and forward it to the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m11s)

[right elements in all cases. And that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m13s)

[kind of obnoxious though. I think we are](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m15s)

[template binding. So, we may be able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m18s)

[drop the inherit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m20s)

[and as soon as we do, I'm going to find](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m23s)

[somebody who was leveraging it at a top](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m24s)

[level element in their app and it didn't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m26s)

[propagate. But I think a converter is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m29s)

[the right thing here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h41m31s)

[the um the action in question won't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h42m00s)

[uh the because it runs under a Linux](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m16s)

[host, it's it's hamstrung because it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m18s)

[actually can't compile nor run the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m20s)

[success if your project can be compiled](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m30s)

[and run by the coding agent because it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m34s)

[now is limited in which things it has](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m37s)

[access to because it can't compile and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m41s)

[hear you.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m56s)

[And that's the problem is it might](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m57s)

[actually do that. But we'll we'll let](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h46m59s)

[that thing go and then we'll see where](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m02s)

[that where that lands. Um, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m03s)

[this guy here, I just wanted to check](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m07s)

[failed.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m23s)

[fail.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m32s)

[I have warnings as errors turned on.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m34s)

[Contrast constraint test. Oh, so the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m39s)

[issue is I have warnings as errors](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m42s)

[turned on and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m45s)

[this now it it the the warning. Yeah. So](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m48s)

[it's fine here. But if I look, let's see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m52s)

[if I rebuild, I should see the warnings](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m56s)

[and then we can chase them down. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h47m58s)

[there they are.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m00s)

[Yeah. So that's those are there. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m03s)

[And yet GitHub is now owned by](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m06s)

[functionality for a while. Um it's just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m16s)

[like the Linux runners are so much](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m19s)

[faster. Most they they put a lot of](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m21s)

[effort into those because most projects](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m24s)

[can be cross-co compiled. And you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m26s)

[technically can turn on Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m28s)

[you can turn on. However, I have not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m37s)

[figured out how to get the appropriate](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m40s)

[saying, "I can't find the SDK." So, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h48m50s)

[delta constraint instead.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h49m12s)

[So delta constraint](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h49m15s)

[I am tempted to not](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h49m51s)

[because this is actually creating a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h49m58s)

[want to do here is actually just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h50m08s)

[why but it's specifically it says to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h51m27s)

[using a delta constraint which wraps the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h51m31s)

[building the delta constraint. So it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h51m37s)

[feels like the one use case where it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h51m39s)

[because this is the other case where I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=02h52m01s)

[but it'll](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h02m53s)

[fix the bit that's there because I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h02m56s)

[believe TUnit requires all tests to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h02m58s)

[async if I remember right. Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h03m01s)

[small typos. Yes,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h03m52s)

[I should consider that. I've I've](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h03m55s)

[on the-fly typing things, but that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h03m59s)

[actually probably a very reasonable](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m01s)

[I I don't know. It's It's kind of a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m12s)

[weird thing because when you're doing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m15s)

[voice to text to type](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m17s)

[I like at first it's weird because](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m21s)

[pauses actually have a practical effect](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m24s)

[versus when you're talking to somebody a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m27s)

[pause doesn't or typically doesn't. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m29s)

[mean I suppose you put a pause at the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m32s)

[wrong point in a sentence and you can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m34s)

[change the meaning. That's different.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m35s)

[Um, but it is something that I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m37s)

[it it allows me to go a little quicker.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m43s)

[So, specifically even when like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h04m45s)

[We can resolve that one](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h06m16s)

[and we did that. Uh I implemented](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h06m18s)

[claiming the textbox has keyboard focus](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m23s)

[too](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m28s)

[shockingly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m31s)

[because it doesn't have focus.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m38s)

[So it actually doesn't get focus. So if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m43s)

[we go here, right, let's run the uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m47s)

[let's debug this test. So what should](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m50s)

[happen is I don't I I should look and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m53s)

[see if I'm attaching to the remote](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m55s)

[process, right?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h11m57s)

[So if I'm not attached to the remote](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m00s)

[process,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m02s)

[two did not get focus back.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m07s)

[So the issue is we are not setting focus](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m11s)

[all the way back in. So the test is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m15s)

[failing appropriately.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m17s)

[So this weight is not going to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m20s)

[anything.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m24s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m25s)

[the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m27s)

[see this is in the dialogue host](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m32s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m37s)

[and let me the other thing I wanted to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m39s)

[double check is the registration and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m42s)

[unregistration of the wind proc](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m45s)

[handlers.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m47s)

[Um, let's see. This is going to be down](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m50s)

[around 420, 430 somewhere.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m52s)

[430.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m56s)

[Okay. So, there's the wind proc handler.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h12m57s)

[And I am willing to bet when we come in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m01s)

[here, we are not getting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m05s)

[restore. I bet you we're getting](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m08s)

[maximized or similar.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m10s)

[Yeah, maximizes window. I bet you that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m14s)

[the problem. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m20s)

[let's do this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m21s)

[constint](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m24s)

[sc](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m26s)

[uh sc maximize equals okay co-pilot if](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m29s)

[you actually got that right](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m33s)

[sewer F30. Okay. All hell co-pilot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m41s)

[is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m42s)

[or](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m46s)

[let's see maximize I uh restore slash](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m48s)

[because I don't know that there is an](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m53s)

[easy way to go from minimize to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m56s)

[maximized](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h13m58s)

[in a](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m01s)

[it just with Windows Explorer. I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m08s)

[know how I do that. Can I?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m10s)

[I don't think there's a way I can just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m13s)

[rightclick and maximize the window. Now,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m15s)

[the test though adequately demonstrates](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m19s)

[that there is definitely a programmatic](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m22s)

[approach to doing this and I think this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m24s)

[will fix it. I think it's just the fact](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m27s)

[that we were watching for a whimrock](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m30s)

[message of restore](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m33s)

[and restore I believe just brings it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m35s)

[back to the normal window state and we](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m37s)

[probably never see that message. It](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m39s)

[probably just sends a blind maximized.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m41s)

[Oo interesting. Still fails.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m47s)

[Still fails.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m50s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m53s)

[let's grab it here.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h14m59s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m04s)

[um but I need to be debugging the remote](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m07s)

[process to have that breakpoint hit.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m11s)

[Which means I also need to drop](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m15s)

[this break point because now when I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m18s)

[debug this test, I'm actually going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m20s)

[be debugging both the test project and](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m22s)

[the remote window as well,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m24s)

[which is convenient because now I can](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m27s)

[grab a hold of that dialogue host call](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m28s)

[in the remote window.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m30s)

[But I want to see if I actually hit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m33s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m35s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m43s)

[Um, I'm going to change this to like](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m47s)

[10 seconds.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m51s)

[Let's try this again because we never](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m53s)

[saw](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m55s)

[we never saw that Wimprock message come](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h15m58s)

[through.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m00s)

[And I kind of expected it.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m03s)

[Huh.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m15s)

[It's interesting that now it's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m16s)

[it's interesting that this is what's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m28s)

[coming through. So, if I if I take this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m30s)

[off, let's see here,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m31s)

[because I think it it it's probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m38s)

[working in the happy case](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m40s)

[and my neck is killing me.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m47s)

[There. There.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m52s)

[I wonder why having the debugger](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m55s)

[attached is messing with this.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h16m56s)

[Yeah. So that's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m05s)

[it's very interesting that that is going](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m10s)

[through there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m13s)

[There's I I I believe there's probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m15s)

[another param that we need to be](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m17s)

[watching in here, but I think I will](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m18s)

[need to look at this when I have more](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m22s)

[energy and consciousness. But I I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m23s)

[suspect](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m26s)

[there is probably I and we may end up](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m28s)

[doing what we did before where we just](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m31s)

[log out all of the wind proc messages](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m33s)

[that are going through because I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m36s)

[that might be the solution to be able to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m38s)

[actually see everything that is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m42s)

[going through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m45s)

[because when you go to maximize this](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m48s)

[window thereh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m51s)

[one of these I'm surprised it's not the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m53s)

[maximize system command that's being](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m55s)

[sent through](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h17m57s)

[because we grab the restore.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m02s)

[Maybe it's size, but I I'd be a little](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m10s)

[hesitant to to act on size or similar](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m13s)

[if we don't have to because we will see](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m17s)

[that one quite a bit.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m20s)

[I do feel like it should have been](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m23s)

[maximized.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m25s)

[But regardless, I think I'm going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m28s)

[have to chase this when I am conscious](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m29s)

[enough to actually](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m32s)

[actually do so. Um, I will briefly check](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m35s)

[and see. Copilot has done a thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m38s)

[Copilot claims to have done the thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m42s)

[Let's see. Object to string converter.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m45s)

[Not bad. It knew how to do it. Um, I'm](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m49s)

[mildly impressed that Copilot figured](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m52s)

[out that the way we are doing value](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m55s)

[converters here with nullable reference](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h18m59s)

[types is declaring these two as](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m01s)

[nullable. So, I'm I'm mildly impressed](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m03s)

[that it mirrored that pattern. So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m06s)

[points awarded. Um, it's implementation](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m09s)

[basically looks like what I did. I think](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m12s)

[I would want to put this inside of the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m14s)

[internals namespace.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m17s)

[um and not call it object to string](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m20s)

[converter,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m22s)

[but it certainly looks like it did](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m24s)

[exactly what I wanted.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m28s)

[It certainly looks like it did exactly](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m37s)

[what I wanted. I need to also double](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m40s)

[check. I think we saw an issue with](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m43s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m46s)

[trying to remember.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m49s)

[I'm not 100% confident we want to do it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m54s)

[like this. And we may want to do](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m56s)

[resource references inside the style.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h19m58s)

[I'll need to double check. But um](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m00s)

[regardless, this is going to be assigned](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m04s)

[to me. I'm going to pop this into ready](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m06s)

[for review. I'm going to allow the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m10s)

[pipeline to run and then I'm going to](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m12s)

[put this in the 531 milestone.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m15s)

[And this guy should already be in there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m19s)

[And Copilot actually did a thing.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m22s)

[Um, and I'm going to I want to double](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m25s)

[check this against that original commit](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m28s)

[as well, just to make sure we haven't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m30s)

[missed anything.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m31s)

[But I think this gets it mostly in](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m33s)

[there. Wait, fixes](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m36s)

[Why did you link two issues in here?](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m42s)

[This has nothing to you idiot. Okay. I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m54s)

[was like, this does not fix that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h20m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m02s)

[sure. Copilot, go ahead and set things](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m05s)

[up.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m07s)

[I will allow you to do that.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m08s)

[Have at it. I'll probably clean some](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m11s)

[stuff up later, but it's it's worth](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m14s)

[having something better in there. It's](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m16s)

[worth having something better in there.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m18s)

[That way, it actually does what I want.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m20s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m23s)

[with any luck, some of this co-pilot](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m24s)

[stuff might go through. Maybe I'll turn](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m27s)

[it loose on the uh system message](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m30s)

[commands and see what it says because it](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m32s)

[does have a memorization of the Windows](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m34s)

[APIs that's much deeper than my own,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m37s)

[which isn't horrible. So, with that, I](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m40s)

[want to tell everybody thank you for](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m43s)

[coming and hanging out. Uh hopefully](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m44s)

[that was interesting and at least](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m46s)

[answers the question from before of, you](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m48s)

[know, what's in my template? Why is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m51s)

[everything in there? Where are the](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m53s)

[various pieces? Yeah, no problem JC.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m55s)

[Thank you for uh uh coming over. Uh](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h21m57s)

[porting PR passed on remote. Excellent,](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m01s)

[excellent, excellent. I will probably](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m04s)

[get stuff merged in there very shortly.](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m06s)

[So, we will be having uh preview builds](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m08s)

[dropping for 531. And I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m11s)

[know if the binding air is worth a hurry](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m16s)

[up and kick the 531, but it it also is](https://youtu.be/8HyOFB1j1Nc?t=03h22m18s)
