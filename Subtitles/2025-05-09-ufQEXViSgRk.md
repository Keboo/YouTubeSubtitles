[who are a little more paranoid hey I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h07m54s)

[don't want to be sending bits of my code](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h07m56s)

[to an AI agent that lives somewhere else](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h07m58s)

[happy so you've got Azure AI Google and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m15s)

[then custom URL and so custom URL is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m18s)

[anything that matches like an OpenAI](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m20s)

[compatible endpoint secretly if you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m22s)

[like running Olama locally](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m26s)

[right you can if you've got a system](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m29s)

[could theoretically keep it all local](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m36s)

[at some point I may do a kind of a small](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m38s)

[run some of those models locally like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m46s)

[usually you're going to get better](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m49s)

[stuff so if you happen to have your own](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h08m57s)

[key or uh for whatever reason your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m00s)

[company needs you to uh use their](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m02s)

[instance like for example on Azure just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m04s)

[to make sure that it's uh not being](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m06s)

[exposed poof there you go built-in stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m08s)

[uh otherwise if you just want the hosted](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m12s)

[solution you get the little hosted](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m14s)

[details and the other thing to remember](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m16s)

[is on Git Kraken the tokens reset weekly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m17s)

[right it's kind of nice to have it on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m21s)

[that faster cadence because then you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m23s)

[just spend them right because they're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m25s)

[going to reset at the end of the week](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m27s)

[anyway or beginning of the week i think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m28s)

[it's Sunday I don't remember it resets](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m29s)

[sometime between when I clock off Friday](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m32s)

[when I clock on Monday and during the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m34s)

[middle of the week I rarely open the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m36s)

[screen so it's great not to say I don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m37s)

[use Get Kraken on the weekend i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m40s)

[absolutely do i just don't open the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m41s)

[screen okay so that's that's a lot of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m43s)

[the new AI stuff which is which is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m45s)

[awesome right um now the thing that got](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m47s)

[me way too excited i got very very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m51s)

[excited over this one again I get](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m54s)

[excited over the dumbest features](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m56s)

[hideall show all on the local and remote](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h09m58s)

[sections of the left pane this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m01s)

[awesome okay so I occasionally work uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m04s)

[because in my day job I uh do a lot of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m08s)

[consulting and so I get to see all kinds](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m11s)

[of stuff from uh different people's uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m14s)

[repositories and occasionally I run into](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m17s)

[repositories that have an insanely large](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m19s)

[number of tags branches remotes etc](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m22s)

[right like material design we've got 120](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m25s)

[sitting out there and part of the way I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m28s)

[get to 120 is I've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m31s)

[remotes added but I can just rightclick](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m33s)

[hide all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m36s)

[is that not awesome right and then you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m38s)

[can opt into the the ones that you want](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m41s)

[because the number of times where I want](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m43s)

[to opt in rather than opt out is very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m45s)

[very high right and you can do this on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m49s)

[the local one you can do this on the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m51s)

[remote one you can do this down on your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m54s)

[tags like this hide all is awesome right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h10m55s)

[uh not all of them support it because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m00s)

[like cloud patches doesn't really have a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m02s)

[a show hide toggle thing there right but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m04s)

[the ones that actually have the little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m08s)

[eyeball in this corner here right so if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m09s)

[you see the eyeball you should have the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m11s)

[uh the hide show option which is right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m14s)

[love it love it love it love it um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m17s)

[especially if you're working in repos](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m20s)

[that have huge number of branches or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m21s)

[tags i've noticed just small like you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m23s)

[get a small performance bump when Git](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m27s)

[Kraken's not trying to like render all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m29s)

[of those so just turn off the ones you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m30s)

[don't care about it's wonderful um there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m32s)

[is some new avatar stuff this is one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m35s)

[that's always bitten me for a while um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m36s)

[because it's uh used gravitar for a long](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m39s)

[time which I love because I set up my my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m42s)

[profile picture and then poof it just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m45s)

[floats around and follows me but uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m47s)

[especially if you connect to like a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m49s)

[GitHub enterprise or regular GitHub](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m51s)

[where you've set your profile up there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m53s)

[um they are starting to add in more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m55s)

[avatar support which is cool love it um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h11m58s)

[honestly I don't care this much about](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m01s)

[the um the get executable stuff but this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m03s)

[is very helpful for people who go back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m07s)

[and forth between like the terminal or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m09s)

[some other tool or similar like that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m11s)

[that is definitely helpful](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m13s)

[um and then the the conflict prevention](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m16s)

[so if people haven't seen this little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m18s)

[guy up here right which is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m20s)

[um this will warn you if you are uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m24s)

[going to experience a conflict before it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m28s)

[actually occurs and it's it's decently](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m30s)

[good this actually takes it a step](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m33s)

[further right conflict alerts with your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m35s)

[teammates will now work when the current](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m37s)

[branch has no upstream so current branch](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m38s)

[has no upstream right like let's think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m42s)

[about that for a minute that means you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m45s)

[have a local branch that doesn't have a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m47s)

[remote branch you haven't pushed yet](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m50s)

[right that branch is local to you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m53s)

[so it will warn you when that's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h12m58s)

[potentially going to have a conflict](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m00s)

[which is pretty slick right um and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m02s)

[there's extra things here and then this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m05s)

[bump electron uh V34 huzzah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m07s)

[it might just be me and I might have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m11s)

[some confirmation bias but it feel Git](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m14s)

[Kraken Desktop feels a little snappier i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m16s)

[again could be could be confirmation](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m19s)

[bias not entirely sure it feels nicer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m22s)

[for for all I know right um and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m25s)

[this one here this one was a big one for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m28s)

[me um I I kept getting bit by this over](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m30s)

[and over where the branch labels](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m34s)

[wouldn't render properly and I noticed I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m36s)

[had to like move my mouse over them in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m38s)

[order to get them to show back up uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m40s)

[again so if you're experiencing that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m42s)

[upgrade to 11.1](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m45s)

[released on uh May 6th so two days ago](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m47s)

[at time of recording](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m51s)

[so yeah so that is Get Kraken 11.1](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m54s)

[it is awesome you can always go and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h13m58s)

[watch uh the the video here as well but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m00s)

[if you're reading or listening to this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m04s)

[or seeing it now you're you're watching](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m06s)

[a video so um but you know they put](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m07s)

[together some cool graphics and whatnot](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m11s)

[to to go through and show the the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m12s)

[highlights but those are the things that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m14s)

[excite me the most okay material design](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m15s)

[and ZAML we got we got stuff happening](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m18s)

[we got a lot of stuff happening](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m20s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m25s)

[here we go uh at some point worst case](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m27s)

[scenario we're going to jump all the way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m30s)

[into the T-Unit stuff we'll circle back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m31s)

[on the dialogue host one um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m33s)

[Corin's has gone](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m37s)

[utterly bonkers uh and it looks cool not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m40s)

[going to lie looks cool so we'll we'll](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m45s)

[we'll we'll circle back and take another](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m48s)

[look i I've kind of briefly looked some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m50s)

[of these things over okay so this one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m52s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m55s)

[let's take a look so offc center ripple](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h14m58s)

[on uh pop-up style when clicking on the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m00s)

[pop-up box while it's already open the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m05s)

[ripple effect is slightly off center oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m07s)

[wow so here's here's how you can tell](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m10s)

[when a library is mature like some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m13s)

[people look at the number of open issues](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m16s)

[look at the types of issues though that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m18s)

[are there right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m20s)

[this is the ripple effect which I don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m22s)

[know how well it's even coming through](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m25s)

[on stream but the little animation that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m27s)

[that's like the the water droplet ripple](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m31s)

[effect right at the point of the click](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m33s)

[is not is not centered right now](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m36s)

[admittedly bug right no problem calling](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m39s)

[this a bug but I think we can probably](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m42s)

[agree minor bug right it's it's minor](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m45s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m51s)

[uh let's see the root cause seems more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m53s)

[like a side effect of using the ripple](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m56s)

[in a certain way than an actual bug with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m57s)

[the ripple at least that is my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h15m59s)

[assumption based on the fact that we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m00s)

[have special code for offsetting the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m01s)

[ripple when there is inner content see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m03s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m05s)

[interesting i think some of this code](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m11s)

[may even predate me taking over the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m13s)

[library so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m15s)

[uh let's see in most cases we don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m18s)

[actually put content inside the ripple](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m21s)

[but place it at the same level on top or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m22s)

[below the content i believe this is a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m24s)

[case where that is desired as well so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m26s)

[this PR basically lifts the content](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m28s)

[control up so is no longer a child of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m30s)

[the ripple but becomes a sibling instead](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m32s)

[and so if we look here with fix you can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m35s)

[see that the the animation starts from](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m37s)

[the middle even though he's clicking off](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m39s)

[to the side wonderful](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m41s)

[there is no bloody way that this thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m44s)

[uh gets a test because I don't even know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m46s)

[how you would test this so there's a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m49s)

[there's a subtle change here right that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m51s)

[character right that forward slash](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m54s)

[versus not being here so you you can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m56s)

[also kind of get it from the the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h16m59s)

[outdation](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m01s)

[right but I can also tell that this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m03s)

[the ripple control because there's the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m05s)

[closing there's the closing tag there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m07s)

[that doesn't exist on the right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m09s)

[uh easy approve](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m13s)

[easy approve especially](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m16s)

[now I will I will comment on a couple](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m18s)

[things one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m21s)

[because Nikolai is one of the other uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m23s)

[maintainers on the library when I when I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m26s)

[see fixes that come in that have the the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m29s)

[screen grab like this I usually don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m33s)

[bother to double check his work because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m35s)

[he's one of the other maintainers if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m38s)

[this were an outside contributor I might](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m40s)

[I might actually fire it up and double](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m42s)

[check it because even though the change](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m44s)

[seems benign it's one of those changes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m47s)

[that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m49s)

[could have extra ramifications](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m51s)

[but in this case easy approve easy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m54s)

[approve](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m56s)

[okay uh up down base and we got a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h17m58s)

[pure verification fail uh okay so let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m02s)

[see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m06s)

[update a failing test okay so let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m11s)

[what the bug is first numeric up down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m14s)

[not notified update source mode property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m16s)

[changed that's interesting okay so this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m19s)

[is something that's worth knowing about](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m23s)

[with uh WPF in general uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m25s)

[let's go big right so with bindings](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m30s)

[bindings have an update source trigger](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m34s)

[which effectively says okay when the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m36s)

[following thing happens this is when](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m38s)

[we're going to push the value back to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m40s)

[your view model right updating the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m42s)

[source in this case the view model that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m44s)

[it's bound to is the source it could be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m46s)

[bound to something not a view model but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m48s)

[for sake of argument let's just say](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m50s)

[source equals view model for for this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m52s)

[discussion](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m54s)

[in most cases when you do default](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m55s)

[the the value of default is determined](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h18m58s)

[by the property that the binding is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m02s)

[being applied to and if you are a well-](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m04s)

[behaved property in general if the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m07s)

[property is something that the uh user](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m10s)

[could interact with and modify think of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m13s)

[like the text property of a text box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m15s)

[right that will uh or I I'm sorry I'm](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m18s)

[thinking of binding mode scratch that uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m21s)

[the update source trigger is which one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m25s)

[goes through and does it default can be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m27s)

[lost focus in some cases because if the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m29s)

[user's say in a textbox typing you don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m32s)

[want to necessarily uh send updates back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m35s)

[to your view model on every single key](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m38s)

[press and so a lot of them will default](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m40s)

[to lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m42s)

[uh because that that gives a decent](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m45s)

[balance between keeping the view model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m48s)

[up to date and deferring it sometimes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m49s)

[it's like no no I like I'm doing extra](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m53s)

[data validation and you know this you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m55s)

[know people aren't going to be typing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m57s)

[Moby Dick into this text box let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h19m58s)

[actually you know just validate on every](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m01s)

[key press property changed or numeric up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m03s)

[down case switching to property changed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m05s)

[is I assume in this case the user is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m08s)

[wanting to do some validation or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m10s)

[similarly uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m12s)

[when typing with the keyboard it only](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m16s)

[updates after focus is lost regardless](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m18s)

[of the update source trigger so not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m20s)

[being respected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m21s)

[so what is likely occurring here is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m28s)

[we're probably doing something with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m31s)

[events](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m33s)

[um because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m34s)

[and by doing something with events what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m38s)

[I mean is we are probably not setting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m40s)

[the backing value of this until](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m43s)

[something like lost focus so the binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m46s)

[had So thi this has no effect right we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m49s)

[didn't I I will be shocked if there's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m52s)

[anything in the numeric updown that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m54s)

[inspects the update source trigger of a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m57s)

[binding like possible unlikely what's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h20m59s)

[more likely is we're using events to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m01s)

[determine when we update this value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m04s)

[property uh and it should probably be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m05s)

[updated a little bit more rapidly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m10s)

[uh let's see i attached what could be a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m13s)

[solution though it's probably not the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m16s)

[most efficient by testing the binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m18s)

[currently on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m20s)

[a patch file](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m23s)

[i am impressed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m25s)

[uh no uh let's do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m28s)

[me let me grab this a little differently](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m31s)

[boom so patch files are effectively uh a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m34s)

[text representation of a git commit what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m38s)

[you can kind of think of them as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m41s)

[uh why](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m43s)

[code why don't you support](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m47s)

[okay well VS code sit here boom okay so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m50s)

[let's see what's the what's the delta](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m54s)

[here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h21m57s)

[okay so we see some added lines here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m01s)

[white space curly brace added line](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m03s)

[closing brace okay and then further down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m06s)

[and we'd I have to go and look at this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m10s)

[source file because these are line](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m11s)

[number and column offsets to know where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m13s)

[the things go this is actually grabbing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m14s)

[the binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m17s)

[and then checking the update source](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m21s)

[trigger interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m24s)

[not sure how I feel about that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m27s)

[not sure mo and part of why I'm a little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m31s)

[hesitant on this is because somebody](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m34s)

[could reapply the binding outside like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m35s)

[I'm I'm guessing this is in an apply](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m39s)

[template call](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m40s)

[and this assumes the binding set there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m43s)

[initially and is good to go and doesn't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m45s)

[get changed which is probably true for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m48s)

[most people right most people are going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m50s)

[to be writing something like this but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m52s)

[it's technically possible](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m56s)

[it's technically possible for that to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h22m59s)

[right there's the the one running your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m25s)

[test and then there's the one running](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m26s)

[the WPF app with your controls to test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m28s)

[there's communication back and forth](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m32s)

[over a named pipe but it has to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m34s)

[serialize the the objects back and forth](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m37s)

[that it's talking to and so there are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m39s)

[properties that that you just can't edit](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m41s)

[with ZAML test because they aren't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m44s)

[serializable um or there's actions that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m45s)

[you can't take on the element because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m49s)

[you don't actually have the real element](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m50s)

[inside your test and I was realizing I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m52s)

[left myself a a back door for that so if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h29m56s)

[you do something like uh decimal up down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m00s)

[you can do remote execute and remote](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m03s)

[execute allows you to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m06s)

[uh static void](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m09s)

[uh let's see uh do stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m12s)

[uh decimal up down roll right except for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m18s)

[you should spell control correctly and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m24s)

[not whatever the heck that is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m26s)

[up down there right and then you can do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m30s)

[do stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m35s)

[right and this is this is a a fun little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m38s)

[backdoor because what ends up happening](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m40s)

[is this line executes on your process](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m43s)

[that's running the unit tests sends a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m48s)

[request over to the WPF app the WPF app](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m51s)

[loads up the DLL that that holds the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m54s)

[unit tests grabs this method executes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h30m58s)

[this method and passes in the object](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m02s)

[directly so even though this code is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m05s)

[written inside the unit test itself it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m07s)

[executed by a different process](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m11s)

[and in ZAML test if you have the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m14s)

[debugger attached to both processes it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m16s)

[not obvious that that's what's happening](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m18s)

[but it made me realize that it there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m21s)

[might be an interesting opportunity](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m24s)

[to be able to rewrite ZAML test so that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m28s)

[everything functionally executes inside](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m31s)

[of one of these things it would be an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m33s)

[interesting idea i it was just something](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m36s)

[I was thinking through i was like you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m38s)

[know what that could be that could be an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m40s)

[interesting way of handling things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m42s)

[okay so what is going on here uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m47s)

[increase button click when text is above](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m50s)

[ma max maximum does not increase value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m52s)

[so where did this thing actually fall](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h31m58s)

[over](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m00s)

[which assert did this thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m02s)

[not like expected 30 actual 2.5](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m04s)

[this is interesting by doing it on text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m17s)

[changed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m20s)

[ooh that's interesting because we allow](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m22s)

[the user to temporarily](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m24s)

[type](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m28s)

[because there is a functional difference](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m32s)

[between the text of the updown control](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m35s)

[and the value of the updown control kind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m39s)

[of like in an editable combo box where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m42s)

[you can type into it and the text will](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m45s)

[be one value but your selected item may](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m48s)

[not match because you haven't actually](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m51s)

[picked an item in the drop down that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m54s)

[that's the inspiration for how this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m56s)

[expected to work an editable combo box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h32m57s)

[this feels like a good test and makes me](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m03s)

[suspect then that the implementation is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m06s)

[the actual problem](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m12s)

[cuz this this changed here to do the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m20s)

[textbox change](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m26s)

[set current value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m33s)

[yeah and then this here I think is just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m39s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m44s)

[because we would want to set the current](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m46s)

[value when it parses but not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m48s)

[I think this coerc back is part of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m52s)

[issue okay okay so let's go here let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m54s)

[go here what What breaks if So one I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h33m57s)

[think that fixes this test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m00s)

[it might not we might actually need to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m08s)

[handle both text change and lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m10s)

[okay so that one that one's working what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m18s)

[breaks](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m21s)

[i'm going to take my hands off the mouse](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m24s)

[for a moment](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m26s)

[because there's going to be broken stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m29s)

[because this is this is probably one of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m32s)

[the more well- tested controls](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m34s)

[inside of the library which is good](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m45s)

[that's a timeout let me](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m48s)

[let me run it one more time i I it could](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m51s)

[be that there's just a timeout yeah okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m53s)

[i think I was I think I was touching it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m56s)

[okay and then this is lost focus when](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h34m59s)

[text is invalid and this is where I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m01s)

[think we might just need to handle both](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m04s)

[yeah so this guy failed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m10s)

[and doesn't revert back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m13s)

[right right so if we look at this test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m16s)

[here this is just a datadriven test with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m17s)

[some invalid some different values some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m20s)

[that are numeric some that are all alpha](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m22s)

[some that are a mix which it it probably](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m24s)

[doesn't matter since it's a triparse but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m28s)

[eh whatever um okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m30s)

[and so in this case we expect it on lost](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m35s)

[focus because this move keyboard focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m38s)

[is the key line here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m40s)

[so I'm thinking what we probably need to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m45s)

[do is on lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m47s)

[still do this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m52s)

[so I I I think the change is actually I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h35m57s)

[I think both people got almost to the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m00s)

[full full thing right uh no co-pilot i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m02s)

[said lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m07s)

[did you not Did you not gen the the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m19s)

[method that you just claimed you were](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m21s)

[about to gen for me](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m22s)

[really you're You're going to be You're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m25s)

[going to be that kind of dumb](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m27s)

[you jerk](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m29s)

[you jerk](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m34s)

[okay so we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m40s)

[this if check is kind of superolous](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m45s)

[because how did we get here but whatever](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m50s)

[so when we lose focus what we want to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m53s)

[is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h36m57s)

[then that text doesn't matter anymore](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m00s)

[and then this goes away](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m03s)

[and then that gets cleaned up and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m05s)

[we need to make sure we unregister it as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m08s)

[well](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m11s)

[there's kind of a nitpicky thing here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m17s)

[and I'm not going to change it because I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m19s)

[think it reads better but oftentimes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m20s)

[there is an idea that you should](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m24s)

[unregister in the opposite order that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m27s)

[you register in it's one of those kind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m29s)

[of patterns that sticks with you around](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m31s)

[like locking and synchronization stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m34s)

[well so it's just it's one of those](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m36s)

[little things not a big deal okay let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m38s)

[let's run these tests because these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m42s)

[tests should now pass](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m44s)

[then I think we should add one more test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m50s)

[to the uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h37m54s)

[to account for the new](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m01s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m03s)

[i'm sorry what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m06s)

[which one of you failed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m17s)

[i'm sorry](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m23s)

[2 A](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m29s)

[oh that's interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m35s)

[2 A actually parses as two because the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m38s)

[two matched](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m42s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m45s)

[H](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m47s)

[that is interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m49s)

[interesting interesting interesting if I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m52s)

[put an A in front of that I bet you it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m54s)

[then passes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h38m56s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m01s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m10s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m16s)

[i think what we're going to do is we're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m19s)

[going to make a separate test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m21s)

[uh no actually](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m24s)

[so here here's a good way of do so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m26s)

[people run into this a lot right they've](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m28s)

[got a datadriven test and they're like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m30s)

[well](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m32s)

[in this case my expectation is a little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m34s)

[different i actually want it to be two](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m36s)

[and some people will do something like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m38s)

[if input text right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m40s)

[equals 2 a then do one yeah don't do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m44s)

[that that's bad like you you you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m48s)

[want to avoid if conditions and loops](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m52s)

[inside of your test right your test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m55s)

[should be very very deterministic a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m57s)

[better approach is when you run into a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h39m59s)

[situation where you've got a datadriven](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m03s)

[test and you need to change behavior or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m04s)

[change expectations](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m07s)

[do it here right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m09s)

[expected text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m12s)

[right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m15s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m21s)

[2.5](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m25s)

[2.5](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m28s)

[two](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m33s)

[right so now we've solved part of it I I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m34s)

[sort of expect it to fail on the value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m38s)

[down below too I I think I need one more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m39s)

[so I think what I'm going to do is I am](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m48s)

[just going to change this to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m50s)

[decimal](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m53s)

[change this to expected value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m55s)

[and then say](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h40m59s)

[expected value to string](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m02s)

[and then change this to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m05s)

[expected value and then these just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m09s)

[switch over to become](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m12s)

[Oh interesting you can't Oh that's an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m23s)

[interesting interesting one i didn't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m27s)

[consider that so decimals can't be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m29s)

[constants](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m33s)

[and and the reason is because of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m38s)

[size of a decimal a decimal is 128 bits](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m40s)

[and it bothers me that I can get away](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m50s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m52s)

[and I only get away with this because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m56s)

[I'm picking values that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h41m58s)

[um I don't believe have a floating point](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m02s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m05s)

[so stupid](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m10s)

[so stupid](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m13s)

[because it's two and a half we're fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m21s)

[okay so that handles that um but I think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m25s)

[what is missing is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m29s)

[I think for this issue I would like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m31s)

[I would like to actually write a test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m37s)

[so that it reflects appropriately now I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m48s)

[I thought we had some base tests for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h42m51s)

[maybe they were too difficult](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h43m01s)

[to implement um but I think this thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h43m04s)

[warrants a test because I want to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h43m07s)

[I'm like and the argument was you know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h47m36s)

[because co AI is going to replace](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h47m38s)

[programming blah blah blah it's like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h47m40s)

[maybe but but no like I kind of feel](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h47m44s)

[I just I don't I don't agree like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h48m02s)

[all you're going to do is lower the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h48m07s)

[you're going to need people who who](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h48m20s)

[actually understand what's up right like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h48m24s)

[until until the AI can write perfect](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h48m26s)

[want to I don't want to knock it too](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m08s)

[much like there is there is great value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m09s)

[that can be gained from leveraging AI](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m12s)

[tools](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m14s)

[but I think people miss the fact that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m16s)

[it's a tool](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h49m18s)

[what did you do there to make it do the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m26s)

[closing brace technically not a lot um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m28s)

[so all I was doing inside of my diff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m31s)

[view is I was right-clicking to discard](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m33s)

[changes and once I got um because if I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m35s)

[go up here and do this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m40s)

[you'll note even in Visual Studio it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m44s)

[got the green bar all the way up here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m46s)

[now and it's just an artifact of how Git](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m48s)

[detects where the change starts and ends](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m51s)

[because now there's an a blank line here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m54s)

[it goes oh oh blank line to blank line](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h53m57s)

[this is what's added it's like well yes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m00s)

[technically from a textbased standpoint](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m03s)

[that is the delta oh and I dropped this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m05s)

[put that back um but from a logical](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m08s)

[coding standpoint no like this is not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m12s)

[the existing curly brace this is the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m15s)

[existing one this one's new but you know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m17s)

[it gets greedy and so it it does that so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m20s)

[all I did was change the delta so it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m24s)

[could figure out which one was the new](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m26s)

[one that's all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m27s)

[uh cheap tricks](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m30s)

[okay uh and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m33s)

[I am noticing that we move keyboard](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m36s)

[focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m38s)

[why did this thing go to a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m41s)

[Hang on i want to look at what this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m48s)

[thing failed but what did the failure](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m50s)

[number say expected to be four but got](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m52s)

[10 i wonder why it defaults to 10 in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m55s)

[this case](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m57s)

[oh probably because maximum set first](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h54m59s)

[and so it comes in from the zero](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m01s)

[maybe I'm surprised it defaults up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m04s)

[rather than down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m07s)

[um but that's fine i think all we do is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m10s)

[uh let's see modifier keys](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m15s)

[control](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m19s)

[uh keys](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m22s)

[A](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m24s)

[or key A](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m25s)

[right so come in here select all or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m27s)

[that should functionally replace it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m36s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m42s)

[what are you unhappy about](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m45s)

[expected to be four but got four](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m48s)

[obviously](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m51s)

[co-pilot](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m53s)

[bet it sent it through as a or I don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m56s)

[think this was a Whoa](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h55m59s)

[that was fun um I bet you it sent it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m02s)

[through as a string and just didn't know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m05s)

[how to handle it because I bet you the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m06s)

[is int portion is what's failing let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m09s)

[double check](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m12s)

[because all we can see from this is that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m18s)

[the stringified version of tag works](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m20s)

[oh and it's Oh it's over the top](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m25s)

[okay we're going to do this normally I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m29s)

[drag it onto a second monitor but that's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m31s)

[boring for everyone else um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m33s)

[see if I can get this into a good place](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m37s)

[there we go tag is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m39s)

[string that's why okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m43s)

[kill that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m48s)

[uh so let's just do assert equals and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m50s)

[because at the end of the day as long as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m55s)

[I get the right value through here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h56m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m00s)

[why does my why is my thing convinced](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m03s)

[the control key is being held down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m06s)

[sorry I'm cycling my keyboard real quick](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m09s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m11s)

[I'm an idiot](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m19s)

[um this is pressing the control key](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m22s)

[and it's sending the key down but never](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m29s)

[the key up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m32s)

[that's why this one exists](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m38s)

[because if you don't do this ZAML test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m43s)

[sends control A down types four and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m45s)

[never sends the up because until you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m50s)

[tell it modifier keys none it says well](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m53s)

[I assume you wanted me to keep holding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m55s)

[the control key down i'm doing it thank](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h57m57s)

[you you're doing what I I should](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m01s)

[probably look at having like an error or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m04s)

[something if if a test ends](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m06s)

[and it still has a modifier like it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m09s)

[doesn't actually know the length of a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m12s)

[test but it does know it in like this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m14s)

[test recorder so maybe at a minimum test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m15s)

[recorder should report back hey by the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m18s)

[way you [ __ ] your co your control key](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m22s)

[or shift key or alt key is still being](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m26s)

[held down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m27s)

[uh right so assert equal](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m30s)

[uh let's see stop it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m35s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m39s)

[assert equal and we are just going to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m41s)

[assert for the string and we're just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m43s)

[going to do tag to string all right so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m47s)

[if we get if we get back the string of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m49s)

[four good enough](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m51s)

[good enough](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h58m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m05s)

[so this updated the value on property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m09s)

[changed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m11s)

[i feel like I want to do one more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m18s)

[uh let's see and I want to set value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m23s)

[equal to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m26s)

[three just so we can do this and I want](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m28s)

[to do lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m30s)

[uh is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m34s)

[lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m41s)

[it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m44s)

[does not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m48s)

[update](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m50s)

[until](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m55s)

[it loses](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=00h59m57s)

[focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m00s)

[all right so we're going to do this uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m02s)

[let's see so we're going to grab this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m11s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m12s)

[it's the easiest way to commit](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m15s)

[is we probably should also watch things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m18s)

[like key down or enter because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m20s)

[oftentimes the enter key submits focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m22s)

[but that's that's a future thing right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m25s)

[because there's a number of cases where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m27s)

[people start typing and they expect it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m32s)

[to work like escape is often expected to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m34s)

[say you know I typed this in reload from](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m37s)

[the your value don't take what I typed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m40s)

[in right so there there may be some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m42s)

[arguments to to have support for those](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m45s)

[at some point and if somebody wants to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m48s)

[submit them I will happily take PRs for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m50s)

[now we are going to focus on just this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m53s)

[get it focus lost focus that was a pun](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m55s)

[that was funny you should be laughing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h00m58s)

[right now](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m00s)

[uh Okay so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m02s)

[some of these sorts of test I usually do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m09s)

[as a behavior-driven design uh Girkin](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m12s)

[style of test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m15s)

[okay Izzy I need a little explanation i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m19s)

[don't know Girkinstyle](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m21s)

[i know BDD](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m23s)

[i'm gonna I'm gonna Google this on a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m27s)

[different screen because I don't know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m29s)

[what's going to come back we're just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m30s)

[gonna](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m32s)

[Oh okay yeah yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m37s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m42s)

[uh given my unit under test yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m45s)

[yeah domain specific language in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m48s)

[behavior driven development to write a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m50s)

[test case in a structured format](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m52s)

[yes yes and I think cucumber is where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h01m57s)

[I've seen this done a lot](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m04s)

[there was actually Okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m09s)

[I'm going to show you something and I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m12s)

[want you to take it with a grain of salt](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m14s)

[and not ever use it in any serious](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m18s)

[codebase okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m20s)

[I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m23s)

[prefix it with that because I saw](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m25s)

[something the other day that allows](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m28s)

[C to do something very very bad](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m37s)

[uh let's see uh Hessen I'll come back to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m41s)

[that question in just a second](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m44s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m47s)

[so hypothetically](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m49s)

[if you wanted your test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m52s)

[to look like this right you'll note](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h02m54s)

[that and that and that there's still the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m00s)

[there's still the little PNS at the end](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m04s)

[but you can put spaces in your test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m08s)

[names](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m10s)

[now again I'm sharing this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m12s)

[I am not recommending this i am](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m16s)

[absolutely not recommending this okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m19s)

[just going to be clear so this I nearly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m22s)

[he's got several big libraries people](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m33s)

[probably know him from um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m35s)

[but he he made a note that in the the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m39s)

[language spec that it supports uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m42s)

[Unicode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m47s)

[specifically UTF-16](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m49s)

[and there are characters that look a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m51s)

[heck of a lot like a space in that and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m53s)

[in the C spec when you're doing a method](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h03m56s)

[the first character of an identifier](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m04s)

[than middle characters because I've](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m07s)

[played with this a little bit myself so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m09s)

[I'm familiar with this but if you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m11s)

[writing a method name and you want it to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m13s)

[read like a sentence and you don't like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m15s)

[you know the uh the snake case or the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m18s)

[camel case or the Pascal case or the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m21s)

[kebab case or whatever you're going to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m23s)

[do and you want spaces all you have to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m24s)

[do is do something manipulative with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m27s)

[like auto hotkey or similar to be able](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m31s)

[to put in fancy characters in your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m33s)

[method names and now your method names](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m37s)

[can have spaces the one area that I I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m39s)

[strongly suspect this breaks down in and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m43s)

[I think he may call it out at the end](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m46s)

[uh I don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m54s)

[know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h04m57s)

[i so the one area I suspect it's more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m00s)

[likely problematic in is something like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m04s)

[runners things where you're running your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m09s)

[tests in a terminal that may not have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m12s)

[the same level of support especially](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m14s)

[character support like I've seen Azure](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m17s)

[DevOps do this where it does like I have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m18s)

[lots of liatures on my system things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m22s)

[look great in my terminal my terminal](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m25s)

[setup and I like it uh DevOps runs a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m26s)

[very dumbed down terminal and does not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m29s)

[support all this stuff and I suspect it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m32s)

[may make some of those things look ugly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m33s)

[like I suspect tooling support for doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m35s)

[this kind of wackiness with Unicode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m38s)

[results in some tools drawing like boxes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m40s)

[or similar garbage but again fun thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m42s)

[there uh Hess so your your question](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m46s)

[there about why why do we allow um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m48s)

[characters in there and that was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m53s)

[actually a bit of a debate when we first](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m56s)

[went through and implemented this of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h05m58s)

[should we allow](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m01s)

[non-numeric characters it gets slightly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m03s)

[part of the reason why we allowed it is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m06s)

[laziness um the other part was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m08s)

[localization got a little more weird](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m15s)

[because it's kind of po like inside of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m17s)

[the the base control it's doing a try](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m21s)

[parse so at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m24s)

[it's going to trip parse its way into a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m27s)

[numbery thing um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m30s)

[and so it's it's not likely that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m34s)

[something weird is going to work but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m38s)

[periods commas um other separators that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m41s)

[may exist in different locales got to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m44s)

[a little more problematic and we just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m47s)

[didn't want to deal with that um and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m49s)

[rather than trying to limit the set of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m51s)

[characters that were allowed because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m53s)

[there are things like a mass text box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m55s)

[that people have asked for as well that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m57s)

[effectively limit the keyboard input um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h06m59s)

[to to do that kind of thing so it's it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m05s)

[was a little bit of that little bit of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m08s)

[laziness it also does allow it because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m10s)

[in theory people could write a derived](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m12s)

[class from this that say supported](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m15s)

[hexadesimal or similar and it's like do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m17s)

[we want to ban that is it likely](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m19s)

[somebody does it probably not maybe](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m21s)

[so we kind of just punted and said you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m24s)

[know what not going to worry about it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m26s)

[not going to worry about it that we're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m28s)

[just we'll let them type it also felt](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m30s)

[nice to have some symmetry with the way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m33s)

[an editable combo box works where it'll](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m36s)

[let you type in whatever you want but at](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m38s)

[the end of the day if the text doesn't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m40s)

[match an item in the list it goes no and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m42s)

[so the the numeric updown is kind of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m46s)

[same way it'll let you type whatever you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m49s)

[want but at the end of the day it's not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m50s)

[going to set the value unless it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m52s)

[actually matches a valid value right uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m54s)

[why would you want a variable or method](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h07m58s)

[to be a sentence so in general you don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m00s)

[the one exception is in test methods](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m03s)

[because I usually tell people um I my my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m07s)

[strong preference is that when I read a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m12s)

[unit test method I want to know what is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m16s)

[being tested the conditions under which](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m19s)

[it's being tested and the expected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m21s)

[outcome because when a test starts](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m23s)

[failing I need to know is the test wrong](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m26s)

[is the code wrong I I need to have some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m29s)

[context of what is correct and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m32s)

[oftentimes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m34s)

[uh because of that test method names](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m36s)

[generally get long right and I see Izzy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m38s)

[calling out spec flow um which I believe](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m42s)

[I looked at at one point like there's so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m44s)

[many out there i had somebody ask me the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m47s)

[other day uh what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m48s)

[end of life has been announced](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m53s)

[this is news to me](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h08m59s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m05s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m12s)

[sorry Izzy i I I am unlikely to adopt](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m15s)

[something that's already uh Oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m18s)

[wreck and roll](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m24s)

[i need to look at this because I feel](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m28s)

[like this is hopefully a a pun on Rick](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m30s)

[rolling somebody and I that would make](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m33s)

[me incredibly happy um I might have to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m36s)

[look at going to go in my uh my long](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m39s)

[backlog of reading reading Q stuff to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m42s)

[take a look at but yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m45s)

[uh okay what was I doing here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m49s)

[crl+ A4](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m55s)

[get the value uh and then I want to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h09m56s)

[uh how was I moving keyboard focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m01s)

[before](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m04s)

[i think what we can do is we can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m07s)

[actually just do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m09s)

[uh send keyboard input and I can just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m12s)

[send a tab and call it a day](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m14s)

[and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m18s)

[we'll just send a tab key and that'll](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m22s)

[move it uh at some point before 2050 I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m24s)

[might get around to updating them not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m28s)

[wrong oh I messed up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m31s)

[i'm supposed to have another link down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m34s)

[here in my little cycling of links i got](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m36s)

[I got a new one i got a new one here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m39s)

[I'll put it in chat](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m41s)

[uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m44s)

[so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m50s)

[Oh hang on that's the wrong link that's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m52s)

[the wrong link i'm an idiot i can't type](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h10m54s)

[there that one should be right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m02s)

[there we go so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m05s)

[I am now a Hero Devs affiliate](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m10s)

[which is fun um but this may this may be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m13s)

[important to to somebody like you Izzy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m17s)

[as well is they offer what they call](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m19s)

[their never-ending support for a lot of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m22s)

[outof-date frameworks um the key thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m24s)

[here is the idea that it's it's morphing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m27s)

[for a project not vitamins so it's the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m30s)

[uh it's trying to keep something going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m34s)

[until you either uh can sunset it or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m37s)

[actually have the time or money to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m41s)

[upgrade it because some people get stuck](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m42s)

[with various CVEes or other things where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m44s)

[it's like ah we've got this major](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m47s)

[security vulnerability how do we patch](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m48s)

[it well it's out of support no one's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m50s)

[patching it well somebody is patching it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m51s)

[it's probably them um and specifically](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m53s)

[where is the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h11m57s)

[their support button](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m00s)

[i think it okay if I just do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m02s)

[support I believe it gives you the list](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m05s)

[of everything everything they are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m07s)

[building and what exactly the they](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m09s)

[support um and it is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m11s)

[uh they they have quite a bit here and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m16s)

[they usually try to have people contact](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m19s)

[them because they actually try to look](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m21s)

[at your dependency chain to make sure](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m23s)

[they can support all of your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m24s)

[dependencies uh where is my notepad yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m26s)

[I I'm gonna make another linky thing to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m30s)

[put in my cycling of links so but if you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m32s)

[uh if you need it Izzy her](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m36s)

[devs.kaboo.dev](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m38s)

[that drops you on my affiliate link so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m40s)

[if you end up needing them for something](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m42s)

[uh I can also make introductions as well](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m45s)

[uh if that helps anybody along um just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m48s)

[as a way of being able to go through and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m52s)

[do it because again it's not like it was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m53s)

[interesting because I was having a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m56s)

[discussion with them around well this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m58s)

[feels weird right like I generally am](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h12m59s)

[the person who's upgrading somebody's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m02s)

[solution to be in a supported framework](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m04s)

[why would I recommend this like well we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m06s)

[don't uh the way they put it they're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m09s)

[like we're not trying to stop anybody](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m11s)

[from migrating like that's the right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m12s)

[solution for most products right you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m14s)

[either going sunset it or you're going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m17s)

[to bring it forward you're not usually](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m18s)

[expected to keep some outof-date thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m20s)

[running forever right it's just that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m22s)

[some people don't have the time or the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m24s)

[money and if you've got an issue like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m26s)

[you got to do something and they tend to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m29s)

[be a lot cheaper than a migration and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m32s)

[they're like "Yeah if somebody migrates](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m35s)

[and gets off our stuff that's great."](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m36s)

[And the reason they can say that is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m38s)

[because they know that there's always](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m40s)

[going to be something else that's now](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m42s)

[out of support just because you do a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m43s)

[migration once at some point that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m46s)

[thing's going to be out of support again](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m48s)

[later and you come right back to it so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m50s)

[it's it's not a it's not a really a big](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m52s)

[big issue](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m54s)

[uh let's see so tag](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h13m56s)

[uh before lost focus and then we're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m00s)

[going to do this guy up here tag after](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m04s)

[lost focus right and then we're just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m07s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m09s)

[uh let's actually grab all three of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m12s)

[these i think all three of those](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m13s)

[technically count as what we are testing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m15s)

[here and then let's see tag before lost](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m17s)

[focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m21s)

[we expect to be three actually you know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m23s)

[what this should be a two if we're going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m25s)

[to make a 42 joke we should actually use](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m27s)

[a four and a two um and then this should](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m28s)

[be a four](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m32s)

[right to uh tag after loss focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m35s)

[useful for some government progress i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m42s)

[believe they're finally moving to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m44s)

[Windows ME uh I remember a long time ago](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m46s)

[I heard somebody call Windows ME um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m50s)

[Windows 98 Third Edition and that has](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m52s)

[stuck in my head ever since and I love](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m55s)

[it most people I say 98 Third Edition](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h14m57s)

[and they just look at me like I'm an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m00s)

[idiot it's like well like Windows ME](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m01s)

[came out because Windows 2000 was taking](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m04s)

[so long and they wanted something that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m06s)

[was a little more like consumerry](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m08s)

[to be the enterprise the enterprise](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m12s)

[version and then well 2000 was stable](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m14s)

[and me was I think one of the few](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m18s)

[versions of Windows that if I left it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m20s)

[alone long enough it would eventually](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m23s)

[corrupt and delete itself](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m25s)

[that just brings so much inspiration but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m28s)

[it did windows ME came with a ridiculous](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m31s)

[amount of UI customization that you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m34s)

[could do like you could do lime and all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m37s)

[kinds of stuff all over it was uglier](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m40s)

[than I'll get out okay so this failed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m43s)

[expected to actual 4 surely it was the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m48s)

[fourth edition the partially re](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m51s)

[released version between them well there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m54s)

[was Windows 98 SE for second edition](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h15m57s)

[i don't think there was a Okay hang on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m01s)

[windows versions i'm fairly confident it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m05s)

[went 98 SE or 98SE and then ME and 2000](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m08s)

[came out like ME came out I think early](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m13s)

[2000 and Windows 2000 came out late 2000](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m16s)

[let's see here 95](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m21s)

[so 98](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m24s)

[98 second edition](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m26s)

[Windows 2000 Windows ME](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m28s)

[oh so I got them backwards windows 2000](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m31s)

[came out first and then Windows ME came](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m34s)

[out](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m36s)

[uh Dresgeeek](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m43s)

[thank you for the follow i appreciate it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m45s)

[yeah so I had those backwards](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m48s)

[i'm I'm slightly ashamed to admit it but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m51s)

[one of the first computers that was mine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m54s)

[to to hack around and play on was a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m57s)

[WindowsME computer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h16m59s)

[yeah 2000 yeah server version or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m03s)

[enterprise grade like that was the that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m06s)

[was the target audience for for the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m09s)

[Windows 2000 era like it was because the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m11s)

[NT was their new technology right like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m14s)

[it was it was the thing um but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m16s)

[like it was also the foundation under](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m21s)

[which XP got built up because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m24s)

[Windows NT was fairly stable and nice uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m28s)

[and Windows ME though pretty was a hot](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m32s)

[pile of garbage](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m34s)

[like and I think like Microsoft had this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m38s)

[weird leaprogging pattern like me was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m41s)

[kind of trash Vista was kind of trash XP](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m43s)

[was good 7 was good Windows 8 was kind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m46s)

[of trash it was like every other one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m48s)

[and then they they started to get a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m53s)

[little better here but it's kind of hard](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m54s)

[to see if that pattern followed because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m56s)

[they changed their versioning scheme and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h17m58s)

[so it was kind of hard to say what the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m00s)

[next version was because you see like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m03s)

[Windows like most people don't know that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m05s)

[there's this many Windows 10s like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m08s)

[they're like what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m10s)

[right like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m13s)

[and Windows 11 so yeah it's just it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m16s)

[it's weird](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m19s)

[i actually had uh an uncle that I just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m21s)

[recently had to get off of a Windows 10](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m24s)

[computer okay uh so expected two](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m26s)

[but got four and is my expectation wrong](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m33s)

[should value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m43s)

[let's see I tried the fluent thing in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m49s)

[WPF uh with net 9 using the theme mode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m51s)

[property it's broken uh my list view](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m54s)

[grid view column header stops showing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m57s)

[everything works fine in material design](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h18m59s)

[without much modification thank you H](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m01s)

[and I appreciate that yeah so Microsoft](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m03s)

[is like the official stance that they](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m06s)

[have put forward is WPF is not dead they](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m08s)

[are they are still actively maintaining](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m11s)

[it uh part of why they have to say that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m14s)

[is because they have uh a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m16s)

[that's still using it and like for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m19s)

[example Visual Studio there there are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m21s)

[swap like Visual Studio isn't one thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m23s)

[like there's lots of teams touching](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m25s)

[different areas but big chunks of it are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m27s)

[in WPF um which is why you can do if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m29s)

[anybody wants to have some fun right so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m33s)

[Snoop uh yeah Visual Studio exactly Izzy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m36s)

[like Snoop you could take Snoop and go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m39s)

[whoop and you could target Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m41s)

[a snoop and once it figures out its](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m44s)

[thing right uh come on open](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m47s)

[oh did they change oh there it goes oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m53s)

[now I'm about to get two ah now they're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m55s)

[spam so but you can go through and you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h19m57s)

[can manipulate like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m00s)

[like it like it's any other WPF app](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m03s)

[right like so they can't kill it while](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m07s)

[they've got too much dependencies on it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m09s)

[and they aren't going to rewrite Visual](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m11s)

[Studio in a day right or even a release](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m12s)

[like the they want to bring it forward](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m16s)

[but there's but that like that's going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m19s)

[to be a long tail right and the other](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m21s)

[problem is WPF is stable very stable it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m24s)

[is rare to find bugs in WPF that aren't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m28s)

[and I I will clarify it is rare to find](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m32s)

[foundational bugs in WPF there are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m34s)

[things with like um different unicode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m36s)

[support different locales there are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m39s)

[known issues in some of those areas](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m41s)

[there are known issues with certain](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m43s)

[graphics cards drivers where things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m44s)

[don't render right like all of those](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m46s)

[things are potentials but it's rare to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m47s)

[find like fundamental](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m50s)

[bugs in the main logic because it's been](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m53s)

[around so long and it's kind of battle](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m55s)

[tested so it's um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h20m57s)

[yeah shame Snoop still has issues with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m02s)

[Visual Studio when debugging always have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m05s)

[to run without debugging to use Snoop uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m06s)

[with random crashing yeah and I think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m09s)

[some of the issue there is Snoop's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m11s)

[property window rips through all the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m13s)

[properties and so if you if you snoop](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m16s)

[something that has a property that's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m19s)

[like oh well if you call the getter on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m22s)

[this it's a it's an invalid op or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m25s)

[something that is where Snoop often](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m26s)

[brings down crashes or similar and some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m29s)

[of them get handled internally but Snoop](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m32s)

[doesn't always know that and all it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m35s)

[knows is unhandled exception and so it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m36s)

[there are I have seen that happen in a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m39s)

[number of cases where there are some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m41s)

[problems i I really want to submit some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m44s)

[PRs to Snoop to to have some control](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m47s)

[over that behavior to say hey maybe](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m50s)

[let's not query all the properties like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m53s)

[rather than an opt out let me opt in for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m55s)

[what I care about that would be kind of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h21m58s)

[my thought](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m03s)

[just to see how it goes okay so I'm](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m04s)

[thinking](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m08s)

[that my expectation may be wrong cuz on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m10s)

[a text change we expect the value to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m13s)

[updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m16s)

[but only on lost focus do we expect it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m17s)

[to go back the other direction so my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m20s)

[test here is just plain wrong](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m24s)

[though this now feels weird](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m34s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m40s)

[saying to update](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m44s)

[the tag](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m48s)

[why does this binding trigger](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m52s)

[oh because this isn't on the text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h22m57s)

[property so this this is going to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m00s)

[functionally not matter](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m02s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m04s)

[I can this is a bad test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m07s)

[this is a bad test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m10s)

[i would need to set this let me look i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m13s)

[think I have one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m16s)

[up down controls bound numeric up down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m19s)

[method yeah good i think I've got one of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m22s)

[these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m25s)

[are you doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m32s)

[so this should have the default mode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m38s)

[uh update source trigger lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m44s)

[right and I believe lost focus and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m47s)

[default are the same](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m50s)

[no they are different](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m53s)

[uh let's see of the binding target the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m56s)

[default value for most dependency](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m58s)

[property is property changed while](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h23m59s)

[textbox text has a def of loss focus so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m02s)

[because I am not on a text property this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m13s)

[is no workie](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m19s)

[so I would need to explicitly change](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m22s)

[this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m25s)

[um to not do that what is your problem](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m28s)

[here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m31s)

[oh it's because you don't know how to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m34s)

[load the the data type okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m36s)

[I'm just trying to decide if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m46s)

[If I give myself a hook in here or](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m50s)

[similar to be able to toggle this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m53s)

[because I feel like I want to test this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m55s)

[have a good one Izzy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h24m58s)

[uh before I have to drive him to London](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m00s)

[for a school trip cuz he hates trains](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m03s)

[see you next week see you next week](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m05s)

[i think let's give oursel a hook not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m09s)

[sure I like it but I also](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m12s)

[I feel bad not having a good test over](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m15s)

[this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m20s)

[yeah so let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m28s)

[let's grab](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m32s)

[something akin to this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m34s)

[so we're going to do rather rather than](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m39s)

[that for our range we're going to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m41s)

[this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m43s)

[um because that'll get us](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m45s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m49s)

[um and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m54s)

[set minimax that's fine we can do that i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h25m59s)

[don't know that I care about this button](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m02s)

[to Well I do care about the button to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m04s)

[focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m07s)

[but I do also want to grab](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m11s)

[this value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m15s)

[in fact we might end up doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m18s)

[move you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m27s)

[i guess we can leave the text box there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m30s)

[it just feels weird okay um let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m32s)

[grab the text box move the keyboard for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m36s)

[us ctrl A4](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m38s)

[um but I need to change the binding on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m41s)

[this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m45s)

[so let's do numeric updown](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m48s)

[uh let's see static void set binding to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m53s)

[lost focus numeric up down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h26m58s)

[bring that in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m09s)

[uh let's see set binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m11s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m15s)

[I don't want to set the source but I do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m18s)

[want to set the path](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m20s)

[and I want the path to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m22s)

[what is the what is the binding that we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m26s)

[have here value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m28s)

[right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m32s)

[i guess I could just do a name of in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m36s)

[here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m38s)

[that'll be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m40s)

[that'll be sufficient](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m43s)

[uh let's see path](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m45s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m48s)

[it wants a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m51s)

[something that could convert](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m54s)

[and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m56s)

[I will give it that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h27m58s)

[what what am I oh it's a property path](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m06s)

[duh uh that takes the string](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m09s)

[I believe yeah string path there we go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m14s)

[which means I can get rid of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m19s)

[interpolation](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m20s)

[for some reason I thought property path](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m23s)

[had an implicit conversion okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m24s)

[regardless set binding numeric updown uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m26s)

[it's going to be the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m30s)

[value property that's a binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m33s)

[okay and then we need to apply this and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m36s)

[so we're going to abuse the wonderful](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m40s)

[thing of remote execution](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m43s)

[uh set binding to lost focus so it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m46s)

[invokes that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m48s)

[okay so that should move it to there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m51s)

[this grabs here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m53s)

[now I think we can do this same](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h28m56s)

[this same idea of what we were going for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m03s)

[because we wanted to be able to get](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m07s)

[value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m12s)

[value before lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m15s)

[value after lost focus](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m18s)

[because that gets me there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m24s)

[I can't call get because value is going](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m33s)

[to update right because value is still](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m37s)

[being set but what is what should be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m40s)

[preventing is going back through here so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m44s)

[let's do let's do this uh static](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m47s)

[uh get view model value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m50s)

[uh numeric up down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m55s)

[numeric up down and then let's do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h29m58s)

[int I guess or um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m03s)

[does remote execute support return](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m13s)

[values did I do that that would be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m15s)

[really cool if I did](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m18s)

[i don't think it does](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m20s)

[it I am brilliant](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m25s)

[okay past Kevin gets huge points for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m28s)

[being totally awesome](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m32s)

[uh let's see bound n](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m36s)

[come on bound numeric up down view model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m40s)

[so we'll cast the data context to the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m42s)

[view model type then we will access the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m44s)

[value property and return it back this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m45s)

[method gets invoked by the WPF process](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m48s)

[which will then serialize it send it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m51s)

[back to the test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m52s)

[all to just get this uh so get view](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m55s)

[model value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h30m59s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m03s)

[we uh value before loss focus gets this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m05s)

[uh and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m15s)

[does it know the type or is it all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m17s)

[object](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m20s)

[it knows the type oh wow i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m25s)

[Xcoding thank you for the follow i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m32s)

[appreciate it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m34s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m36s)

[i don't know why my IntelliSense is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m38s)

[being so bad but that is that is neither](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m39s)

[here nor there welcome good to have you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m42s)

[here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m44s)

[we are having a little bit of fun trying](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m45s)

[to Well it's this PR in question that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m48s)

[we're playing with um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m51s)

[but trying to get I I think we have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m56s)

[appropriately fixed the issue](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h31m59s)

[but just trying to make sure that we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m04s)

[have](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m06s)

[a reasonable test for this okay Snoop](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m08s)

[you're in the way okay so this is a very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m11s)

[convoluted way of going about it but it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m15s)

[should hopefully work](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m17s)

[send it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m20s)

[uh are you the builder of material](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m30s)

[design i am the current maintainer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m32s)

[if that helps i am not the original](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m37s)

[author um but me and a handful of a few](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m39s)

[other individuals](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m44s)

[um actively maintain and work on it so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m46s)

[but yes I am I am one of them some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m51s)

[people call me the the main lead on it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m55s)

[mostly because I have the most](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h32m58s)

[permissions on the repo](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m00s)

[uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m02s)

[let's see here what is this uh strings](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m06s)

[differ expected to actual 10 oh this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m09s)

[because we did](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m12s)

[set value to 10](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m15s)

[i want the value to be two and I want to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m19s)

[get rid of that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m23s)

[let's see how do you manage relay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m27s)

[commands ending up in models instead of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m28s)

[view models is that okay in MVVM uh I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m31s)

[use uh material design a lot on my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m34s)

[projects great job oh thank you Xcoding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m36s)

[i appreciate that it's always good to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m38s)

[hear when it when it works out nicely](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m40s)

[it's I will say it is very much like WPF](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m42s)

[still has a a special place in my heart](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m46s)

[it is one of the frameworks I love very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m48s)

[dearly um so yeah so to answer the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m49s)

[question on relay commands because I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m54s)

[assume oftentimes when this question](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m55s)

[comes up um it's around people wanting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h33m57s)

[to act on say EF entities or similar](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m00s)

[where their model objects end up having](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m04s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m08s)

[um and it really kind of comes down to a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m10s)

[conceptual thing of if you have bindable](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m12s)

[properties and relay commands on an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m16s)

[object](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m18s)

[Is it a model or is it a view model um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m20s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m24s)

[when people say how do you handle doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m27s)

[relay commands in a model it's you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m29s)

[usually the argument for this class](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m32s)

[constitutes a model comes from the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m35s)

[argument that it uh it's it has some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m37s)

[other extra purpose that it serves like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m42s)

[an EF entity or similar](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m44s)

[it is perfectly and I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m47s)

[careful how I word this there are there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m50s)

[are kind of tears in how this works so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m53s)

[if I am building a quick and dirty app](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m56s)

[um that maybe has like a SQLite database](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h34m59s)

[or something I have absolutely no](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m01s)

[problem binding one of those EF models](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m04s)

[straight into my UI maybe slapping some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m06s)

[relay commands on it or similar if I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m09s)

[need them and leveraging it that way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m11s)

[that is perfectly fine for the quick and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m14s)

[dirty what I there there is a judgment](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m16s)

[call to be made but there is a point](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m20s)

[where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m23s)

[you should probably wrap that object](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m25s)

[into a view model or or copy its data](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m28s)

[into a view model or similar because for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m31s)

[for quick and dirty and small things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m33s)

[totally fine right not a big deal um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m36s)

[there are some MVVM purists that will](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m39s)

[probably be pulling their pitchforks out](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m41s)

[about now to throw them at me and that's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m43s)

[okay um because at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m45s)

[what's more important is that you ship](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m47s)

[software that works not that you adhere](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m49s)

[to some design pattern perfectly right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m52s)

[but what I have found in my experience](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m55s)

[is that there is a there's a point where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m57s)

[you start adding so much to your model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h35m59s)

[objects that they become more view model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m01s)

[than model and once you kind of cross](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m04s)

[that threshold that's that's really the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m07s)

[point where you should start backing up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m09s)

[and and questioning if this is really](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m11s)

[the right object for it the other thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m13s)

[that that often bites is like when you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m16s)

[have something that you're maybe you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m18s)

[serializing some state of your app uh so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m20s)

[that the user can you know relaunch back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m23s)

[into their same state or similar right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m25s)

[they've got a they've got a save button](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m26s)

[in the app and they need to reload their](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m28s)

[state](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m30s)

[oftentimes I've seen people try to take](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m31s)

[their view models and serialize those](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m33s)

[and that will work but it often comes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m36s)

[with a lot of extra overhead because now](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m40s)

[you you end up making your view models](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m43s)

[trying to be serializable and there's a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m45s)

[there's a general principle called](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m47s)

[persistence ignorance where it shouldn't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m48s)

[uh your object shouldn't care](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m52s)

[necessarily how they're saved or how](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m53s)

[they're reloaded and oftentimes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m54s)

[I I've also gone the other way where if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m57s)

[if I'm starting to use my view model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h36m59s)

[like a model like a maybe a poco that um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m01s)

[is sent to a web API or like a model](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m05s)

[that's going to be saved to a database](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m09s)

[or to disk or similar that's usually the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m10s)

[point where I start going this this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m12s)

[feels wrong and in some cases when you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m15s)

[build out two two classes they feel](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m19s)

[like you're just duplicating work and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m24s)

[the the first version you probably bar](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m27s)

[the what what happens or at least what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m31s)

[I've seen happen is those two things the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m34s)

[model and the view model tend to update](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m38s)

[at different rates there's often times](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m41s)

[oh I need this extra thing here for my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m44s)

[view model because we're adding this new](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m46s)

[feature in the UI but I don't really](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m47s)

[have any changes to the model to support](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m50s)

[it like that's that's extra stuff and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m52s)

[they start to slowly get out of sync](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m54s)

[which is good right they should have um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m56s)

[distinct differences about them based](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h37m59s)

[upon their role and how the app changes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m01s)

[so often what I will tell people is it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m05s)

[totally fine to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m08s)

[um it if if it's the quick and easy way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m11s)

[totally fine to do it i'm like the MVVM](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m15s)

[purist will hate it and say no no no you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m18s)

[should absolutely not mix your model and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m19s)

[view model stuff in there that blurs the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m22s)

[line and makes it difficult I think um I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m23s)

[think it's worth going through and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m27s)

[doing it the quick and dirty way if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m31s)

[that's what gets you to ship and then uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m32s)

[but being aware that as changes come in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m36s)

[re-evaluate whether that initial design](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m40s)

[should be switched and you should break](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m43s)

[apart the view model and model um into](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m45s)

[two separate classes or not because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m48s)

[there will come a point in a lot of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m50s)

[cases where it might be it might be easy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m52s)

[um to just tack it on resist that urge](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h38m56s)

[and that's usually why people say don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m00s)

[even start down that path at the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m02s)

[beginning that's a horrible idea why](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m03s)

[would you encourage somebody to do it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m04s)

[it's like well because shipping quality](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m06s)

[software is the right thing and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m08s)

[sometimes a relay command on my model is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m09s)

[easy and it gets me shipping quickly but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m11s)

[if I start adding a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m14s)

[it's like there's there's there's wisdom](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m17s)

[in being able to dial it back yeah and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m19s)

[Sire Thomas as purist I agree uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m22s)

[Nathaniel dead no so this is not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m25s)

[Selenium um so I will show you this this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m28s)

[is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m32s)

[ZAML test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m34s)

[um this is a UI testing library that I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m36s)

[built um and I will I will emphasize](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m41s)

[that this is not this is not a general](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m44s)

[purpose like Selenium is a good UI](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m47s)

[testing library um though I prefer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m50s)

[Playright in a lot of cases to it but uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m53s)

[the problem with a lot of those UI](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h39m57s)

[testing libraries is they go through the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m00s)

[accessibility API](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m02s)

[uh to to perform their interactions the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m05s)

[issue I have with that for something](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m08s)

[like the material design project is this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m10s)

[is a theming library i need more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m12s)

[available to me than what the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m16s)

[accessibility APIs expose like I want to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m17s)

[be able to unit test my style triggers](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m20s)

[and my brushes and be able to pull that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m22s)

[stuff out and there's just not a good](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m25s)

[way to do that from the accessibility](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m27s)

[API so this is it's not a generalpurpose](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m28s)

[UI testing framework it lets me test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m32s)

[small amounts of ZAML in isolation but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m35s)

[for a a WPF theming library that's kind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m38s)

[of what I wanted because prior to this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m41s)

[you couldn't really test large portions](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m43s)

[of the library um and you had to rely on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m46s)

[opening up the the demo app and doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m49s)

[things and that i'm bad at I'm bad at](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m51s)

[regression testing unless I have a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m54s)

[script in front of me and so I I like to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m55s)

[be able to have something of this nature](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m58s)

[to be able to do so it is it is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h40m59s)

[something a little bit different](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m01s)

[uh why did I hit debug on that yeah no](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m04s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m07s)

[i've seen some people have said that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m09s)

[they've taken the ZAML test library and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m10s)

[used it for other apps and if it works](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m13s)

[for you great um just know that it was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m14s)

[built with one customer in mind material](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m19s)

[design and it works great for that one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m22s)

[customer so I'm I'm happy to make](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m25s)

[changes and modify it but most of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m28s)

[the things in that library have come](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m30s)

[about because the material design](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m32s)

[library needed it and so I added it okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m34s)

[I think this works a little bit better](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m37s)

[so this validates that when the binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m39s)

[is uh has an update source trigger of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m42s)

[lost focus the view model is not updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m46s)

[until it loses focus however the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m49s)

[property on the control will update](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m51s)

[appropriately huzzah okay so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m53s)

[because I don't think he will hate me](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m57s)

[too much I am just going to check this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h41m59s)

[right into](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m02s)

[Nikolai's branch](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m05s)

[let's see and then we we hit the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m09s)

[affectionate AI generate let's uh text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m11s)

[update issues](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m16s)

[was not properly updating the text in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m17s)

[the text box when focus was lost after](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m19s)

[invalid in add lost focus to update to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m20s)

[textbox value added UI test to verify](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m23s)

[the value is updated that's not bad](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m25s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m27s)

[okay so we're going to send that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m29s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m32s)

[view pull request](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m34s)

[and then this one here uh I will go and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m36s)

[put it feels wrong to put my own review](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m40s)

[on something that I just wrote but you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m42s)

[know what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m45s)

[we're going to put the approve and we're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m47s)

[going to enable automerge if all the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m49s)

[tests pass](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m50s)

[um okay uh fix event subscription](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m53s)

[mismatch](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h42m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m00s)

[this code is so beautiful very organized](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m02s)

[and clean to read i've never seen this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m03s)

[library before uh and I can understand](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m05s)

[what's happening congrats oh thank you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m07s)

[thank you i appreciate it it there is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m09s)

[there's an old adage in software](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m13s)

[development that if it was easy to read](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m15s)

[it was hard to write like I oftentimes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m17s)

[compare it to like somebody's favorite](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m19s)

[novel right like you pick up a good book](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m22s)

[it's real easy to read the story just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m24s)

[you know it it uh you get lost in it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m27s)

[very easily it's like yes that author](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m29s)

[probably spent hours days months years](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m32s)

[potentially putting that together to get](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m35s)

[it to that stage so it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m38s)

[there i occasionally I can be uh I past](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m43s)

[Kevin was an idiot uh and he](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m47s)

[occasionally wrote really clever code](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m49s)

[that was difficult to read but uh and I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m51s)

[still do it every now and then and I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m54s)

[very much enjoy it but it is there's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h43m57s)

[there there's wisdom in being able to go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m00s)

[back and forth i I will say like the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m02s)

[material design project there's been a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m04s)

[number of changes that I've rejected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m06s)

[just because it would make it more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m09s)

[difficult for somebody coming to the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m11s)

[library to be able to work on it and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m13s)

[I I the I think oftentimes open source](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m16s)

[maintainers forget that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m20s)

[and they they're like well no my library](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m23s)

[is a a highle library i don't want you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m25s)

[know just everybody being able to come](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m28s)

[and contribute to it it's like really](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m29s)

[like the only reason this library has](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m31s)

[survived for as long as it has is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m34s)

[because like if it relied solely on my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m36s)

[time my time oftentimes gets pulled in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m39s)

[so many directions i I get busy i don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m42s)

[have time to work on it but I've been](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m44s)

[able to pick up other people who are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m46s)

[willing to come and help and submit PRs](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m48s)

[and do work on it simply because I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m50s)

[invested time in making it uh easier for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m53s)

[people to to be able to contribute to so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m56s)

[I try I try to organize it that way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h44m59s)

[because I see value in doing so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m01s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m05s)

[how many files are in this 26 great so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m08s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m11s)

[I wonder did Corin say](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m14s)

[I wonder if Corin's rand there's a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m19s)

[PowerShell script that we have oh I used](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m21s)

[your migrate PS1 script and had a quick](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m24s)

[glance at the UI so all the changes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m26s)

[should be fine okay I was going to say I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m27s)

[was going to comment that there's a that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m30s)

[there's a script to do all of this but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m31s)

[Okay okay so this was this was literally](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m33s)

[my script doing it so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m37s)

[yeah and I think initially I had just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m40s)

[not done the the Material Design 3 app](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m43s)

[because it made for a nice testing bed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m47s)

[to make sure that we supported older](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m49s)

[apps um but post the the last release I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m50s)

[probably should have gone through and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m55s)

[done this so this is just something that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m57s)

[was lost to the wind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h45m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m05s)

[yeah my code gets so offiscated even I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m07s)

[need to be debugger just to remember](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m09s)

[what I was thinking yes yeah you'll hear](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m11s)

[me reference past Kevin it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m13s)

[it's he is often my worst nemesis](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m18s)

[yeah this is going to be Why why do you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m26s)

[show commented out oh interesting i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m30s)

[wonder why we commented out the pop-up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m32s)

[box not an issue for today though not an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m35s)

[issue for today](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m39s)

[i'm just kind of spot-ecking each of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m42s)

[these to make sure that the replacements](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m44s)

[look roughly like what I would expect](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m46s)

[though if it was done with the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m50s)

[PowerShell script it should be perfectly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m51s)

[fine and this is just a demo app after](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m54s)

[all but some of these demo apps I intend](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h46m57s)

[to distribute with Vellopac as well just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m00s)

[so because people have often asked for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m03s)

[hey where can I get a compiled version](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m07s)

[of the app and the releases do have it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m09s)

[in a zip form so if people really want](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m11s)

[just the portable version of it like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m13s)

[that's fine but I think sometimes people](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m15s)

[would prefer to have an installable](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m17s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m20s)

[so we'll we'll probably go that route in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m21s)

[fact if people haven't seen it I will](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m24s)

[just point this out so if you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m26s)

[building a WPF and or desktop app of any](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m29s)

[kind regardless of whether it's with C](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m31s)

[or not meet Velopac uh shameless plug](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m33s)

[I'm one of the founders so my opinion is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m37s)

[heavily biased with that said I think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m40s)

[it's awesome](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m43s)

[um if you want a quick and easy way of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m44s)

[building a installer updater framework](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m47s)

[this is this is your go-to right um and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m50s)

[I'll just I'll point out because because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m54s)

[we're doing WPF we've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m57s)

[samples you can see it in the docs as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h47m59s)

[well um but the the amount of effort](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m01s)

[that it takes to add so step one if you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m04s)

[want to add it bring in doug package uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m07s)

[and unfortunately this thing is doing a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m12s)

[project reference but you have to add](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m14s)

[the velop pack nougat package okay great](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m16s)

[uh step two reference it inside of uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m19s)

[your main method now in WPF it gets](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m26s)

[slightly more interesting because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m28s)

[generally your main method is hidden](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m30s)

[from you um the reason for doing this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m32s)

[Vellopac will invoke these callback](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m35s)

[hooks as part of the uh like on first](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m37s)

[run there's there's like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m40s)

[uh on new or was it on update on install](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m44s)

[we just renamed the hook so I'm having](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m48s)

[trouble remembering the names but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m49s)

[there's various hooks that will be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m50s)

[invoked um by the installer so if you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m52s)

[put it past main after it's like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m54s)

[instantiated WPF](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h48m58s)

[you're going to those hooks take longer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m00s)

[to run because it has to do all the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m02s)

[startup stuff so in general it's like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m04s)

[nah just put the hooks as early as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m06s)

[possible so you do have to set up a main](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m08s)

[method but uh there's all the lines the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m10s)

[logger is optional and the on first run](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m13s)

[is optional so app.build.run you're done](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m16s)

[uh then to do updates](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m21s)

[um there is an update manager class](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m26s)

[and uh the update manager class needs to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m30s)

[be fed an update location so in this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m33s)

[case it's using a uh a local directory](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m36s)

[you can point it at a variety of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m39s)

[different update sources you can host](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m41s)

[the it on GitHub releases for example](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m43s)

[you can put it out on an Azure storage](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m45s)

[account if you want a hosted solution](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m47s)

[stand by we're about to release one um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m50s)

[that way you don't have to think if you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m54s)

[just want somebody else to host your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m55s)

[your updates for you and then inside of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h49m57s)

[your app you get to decide when you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m00s)

[going to check for updates when you're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m02s)

[going to download updates and when](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m04s)

[you're going to apply the updates right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m06s)

[so there's three methods there and the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m07s)

[like the apply updates and restart these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m10s)

[this is just an extension method over](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m12s)

[the apply and the restart functions so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m13s)

[if you want to split those across in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m16s)

[your app so in inside of your app you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m18s)

[get to decide when those actions occur](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m21s)

[and what makes sense for you because we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m23s)

[don't want like click once gives you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m26s)

[kind of this similar type thing but it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m28s)

[doesn't give you any control over when](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m31s)

[those things are going like you can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m33s)

[either do it before your app launches on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m35s)

[shutdown it's got like three values but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m37s)

[you can't do like customy stuff very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m40s)

[easily and so we just like that's dumb](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m42s)

[so and then you're off to the races for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m45s)

[anybody who may know Vellopac by its old](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m47s)

[name Cloud Squirrel Clum](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m49s)

[uh the author of Cloud Squirrel Kalin](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m55s)

[and myself like we're the two founders](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m57s)

[of Velopac so if you're wondering where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h50m58s)

[it came from](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m01s)

[uh you can almost think of Vellopac as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m03s)

[Cloud Squirrel V3 is another way of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m05s)

[looking at it though we've done some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m08s)

[massive rewrites so it's it's not a drop](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m09s)

[in replacement for Cloud Squirrel there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m12s)

[is a bit of migration but thankfully](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m14s)

[it's short and easy so if you are](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m15s)

[interested the the SDK and the tooling](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m18s)

[and all of that that is going to remain](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m21s)

[free open source have fun knock yourself](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m23s)

[out um the the hosting solution that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m25s)

[we're going to ship that is going to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m29s)

[have uh paid tiers available to it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m31s)

[because open source software has to find](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m33s)

[some way to fund itself but if you want](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m35s)

[the installer and you want to host it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m37s)

[yourself it is free it is awesome uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m39s)

[check it out](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m44s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m48s)

[this is going to be another easier proof](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m50s)

[i realize I I probably picked on one of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m51s)

[the harder ones to start with uh squash](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m53s)

[merge squash merge](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h51m58s)

[and also if you have any if you run into](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m00s)

[issues with Velopac um do let me know um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m03s)

[I will say one of the things to be aware](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m07s)

[of right now is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m13s)

[don't grab](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m16s)

[don't grab the the latest release the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m19s)

[the 1053](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m22s)

[grab the preview release there's there's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m24s)

[a handful of bugs that got fixed um in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m25s)

[the the 1213 preview package the only](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m30s)

[reason we haven't kicked a new update is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m34s)

[we're trying to get my last PR in so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m36s)

[there's um a breaking change around](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m39s)

[generating MSIs so if you don't care](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m42s)

[about MSI stuff on Windows just like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m44s)

[disregard um but if you do care about](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m47s)

[MSIs we're there's a there's an open PR](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m49s)

[that we are we are working on fixing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m53s)

[because we wanted to be able to support](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m56s)

[um all user installs and being able to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h52m58s)

[generate MSIs with Wix so that is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m01s)

[that is forthcoming if anybody wants to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m06s)

[if anybody wants to to follow along this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m10s)

[is the PR to keep an eye on um but this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m13s)

[this required a lot of effort because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m17s)

[normally Velopac installs per user](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m19s)

[doesn't require UAC elevation and so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m22s)

[getting all of those pieces plumbed in](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m25s)

[uh is non-trivial](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m28s)

[so but that one that one is forthcoming](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m30s)

[as soon as we can hash out a um just a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m32s)

[few cleanup details](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m37s)

[so uh but yes that one is coming as well](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m40s)

[let's see that one's running let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m45s)

[fix autosuggest box not setting selected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m48s)

[item let's see if I understand correctly](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m50s)

[when a value of autosuggest box was](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m53s)

[selected the dependency property was not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m55s)

[being set uh that sounds bad i'm a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h53m57s)

[little surprised that we didn't catch](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m02s)

[that sooner though let's see two-way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m03s)

[binding of selected item property does](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m06s)

[not work with auto oh two-way binding](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m08s)

[okay see now now that's making a little](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m10s)

[more sense](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m12s)

[uh let's see your problem is that when](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m14s)

[selecting an item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m17s)

[it's not being updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m19s)

[let's see uh auto select box is not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m22s)

[automatically updated with the user](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m25s)

[selection so an autosuggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m30s)

[is very similar to a combo box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m32s)

[in the the way that it's expected to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m37s)

[work in that there's kind of a uh text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m40s)

[field there's a dropdown](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m43s)

[uh let's see the commit value selection](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m46s)

[method updates only the controls text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m49s)

[not the selected item perhaps the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m51s)

[selected item property is not being](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m53s)

[updated correctly when the user selects](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m54s)

[an item i don't think we need evaluation](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m57s)

[required on this anymore uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h54m58s)

[which turns the commit](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m02s)

[the selection event is not updating the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m05s)

[selected item property in the auto](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m07s)

[suggest box code there's a commit value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m09s)

[selection method that is called when an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m11s)

[item is selected but perhaps this method](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m13s)

[seems like Hold on this looks like it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m15s)

[was doubled over hang on hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m17s)

[hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m21s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m26s)

[uh perhaps this is uh music is but then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m31s)

[this method](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m39s)

[uh the selection has not been updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m45s)

[i think it's here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m51s)

[in the autosuggest box code there's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m53s)

[the method is not updating](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h55m58s)

[you know what i'm not going to try to do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m03s)

[it because it I I believe](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m05s)

[Let's see what Corins did two changes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m09s)

[so let's see here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m13s)

[uh change the default value of selected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m15s)

[item to be binds 2A by default](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m18s)

[then called set current value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m26s)

[interesting should the value property of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m30s)

[selected item be two-way by default](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m32s)

[i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m38s)

[am not sure about that so let's go and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m41s)

[look at what say list box does because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m43s)

[or it's probably selector](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m49s)

[uh because I am not sure](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m51s)

[if selected item is expected to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h56m58s)

[two-way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m01s)

[is selected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m05s)

[here let's do this uh I know it's this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m09s)

[one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m12s)

[selected item property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m14s)

[okay so selected item property binds to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m18s)

[a by default is the way it's implemented](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m21s)

[on say list box okay so that that all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m23s)

[makes sense and then calls set current](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m26s)

[value here commit value selection](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m30s)

[yeah that makes sense and then let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m36s)

[here so autosuggest box loads in the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m39s)

[template pulls the control back out](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m42s)

[grabs the popup selection list box moves](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m45s)

[keyboard focus send delay and these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m47s)

[delays are only here because of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m50s)

[animations there's I have yet to find a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m51s)

[good way to deal with knowing when an](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m54s)

[animation is completed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h57m57s)

[so it's just like it's annoying but](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m00s)

[I should really set these things up so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m05s)

[that I can put a task out of my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m06s)

[interpolated strings because then I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m08s)

[could do all of this in one shot um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m10s)

[let's see get selected item is string](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m13s)

[banana success](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m17s)

[the only thing here is this is calling](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m24s)

[get selected item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m27s)

[let's look at this because I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m35s)

[if this thing should actually do like](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m37s)

[what we did before where it looks at the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m38s)

[view model behind it so let's see 3847](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m40s)

[but we'll just find it here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m44s)

[uh let's see uh checkout](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m47s)

[okay um and so this is auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h58m54s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m03s)

[unused using at the top not a big deal](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m05s)

[and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m08s)

[that selected item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m12s)

[so what I'm interested in is this user](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m15s)

[control here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m20s)

[does this thing have a view model behind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m22s)

[it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m25s)

[it absolutely does it absolutely does oh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m27s)

[look at this opportunity to make it use](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m31s)

[new code yay new code](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m33s)

[so the new](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m36s)

[collection expression stuff is awesome](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m39s)

[and I love it and it is wonderful](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m41s)

[um what are you suggesting primary](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m46s)

[constructor yeah yeah sure fine we can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m48s)

[primary constructor that no that was not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m51s)

[the suggestion](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m54s)

[there primary constructor](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=01h59m59s)

[But this thing doesn't bind the selected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m07s)

[item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m12s)

[it's binding text](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m14s)

[ah look at that to-do selected item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m17s)

[almost like it was expected](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m23s)

[almost like it was expected okay we're](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m31s)

[going to we're going to fix this sucker](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m34s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m36s)

[uh let's see uh observable property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m38s)

[uh private no suggestion thing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m43s)

[selected item that sounds like a good](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m47s)

[name](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m50s)

[uh you should be nullable](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m52s)

[and then we will come over here we will](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h00m57s)

[get rid of the to-do and we will](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m00s)

[actually implement](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m01s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m03s)

[we should not do this here because this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m13s)

[has display and value member properties](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m16s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m20s)

[we could do it here though](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m28s)

[could absolutely do it here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m31s)

[let's um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m35s)

[let's go here and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m42s)

[cuz you are a set of strings](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m45s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m50s)

[string](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m53s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m55s)

[uh we will autocode you into the new](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h01m58s)

[collection initializer](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m01s)

[which makes me happy](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m04s)

[you want an expression body yeah no i](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m08s)

[wish the analyzer was smart enough to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m11s)

[realize that it can't expression body](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m13s)

[this i I mean I guess it can but it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m14s)

[looks funny](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m18s)

[uh let's see we don't need the base coal](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m21s)

[there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m23s)

[yeah this one should be fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m25s)

[okay so if we go here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m27s)

[we should be able to go with](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m30s)

[uh selected item](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m34s)

[uh binding selected item and that should](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m36s)

[bind two-way by default](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m39s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m44s)

[I think I want to throw away most of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m47s)

[changes on that other one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m49s)

[uh let's see that was with template](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m53s)

[right yeah](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m55s)

[we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h02m57s)

[actually I guess we can keep these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m00s)

[changes there's nothing wrong with them](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m02s)

[they're just updating newer syntax](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m03s)

[that's fine we'll keep it we'll keep it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m06s)

[um I think we will get rid of the to-do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m09s)

[though because this is the wrong place](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m12s)

[and we're handling it on the other one](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m13s)

[so that'll go there](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m16s)

[auto suggest box with collection view](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m20s)

[and then if we go back to our tests we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m24s)

[should see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m26s)

[I think if I hunt in here I'll see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m30s)

[something similar yeah great](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m35s)

[there's that there's that and then I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m38s)

[think what I want to do so it's fine to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m41s)

[get the selected item this way](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m44s)

[um and we don't So this is another area](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m49s)

[where it's it's kind of a minor nitpicky](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m51s)

[thing right but you don't need an assert](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m54s)

[not null and an assert equals because if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m56s)

[selected item were null null is not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h03m59s)

[equal to bananas so it doesn't give you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m01s)

[much extra in general I I usually tell](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m05s)

[people you want as few asserts as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m08s)

[possible to assert whatever condition](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m11s)

[you're testing on right as few as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m14s)

[possible if you put in too many asserts](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m16s)

[what you find is you get into situations](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m18s)

[where your testing suite becomes very](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m20s)

[brittle and it's like well it's we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m22s)

[you'll you hear dev teams say things](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m25s)

[like well we're we did the work but now](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m27s)

[we have to spend another day you know](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m29s)

[updating all of the tests it's like it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m31s)

[sounds like your test suite needs some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m34s)

[some love rather than you know your code](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m36s)

[because your code will rise to whatever](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m39s)

[level your tests are at right like your](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m41s)

[your tests are where your kind of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m44s)

[minimum bar is and if you've over](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m46s)

[asserted you've actually made your test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m49s)

[worse not better](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m51s)

[so it's it's as much art as it is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m53s)

[science but again the general guidance](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m56s)

[is as few as is needed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h04m58s)

[and it's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m02s)

[that is subjective](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m06s)

[so I want to reach across and grab that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m08s)

[thing as well so suggest box all right](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m11s)

[let's let's go with uh static void](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m21s)

[assert view model property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m23s)

[uh auto suggest box auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m27s)

[okay copilot impress me boom](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m32s)

[okay the thing is is we're not doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m37s)

[that garbage we are going to hard cast](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m39s)

[We are not going to do this as garbage](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m43s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m48s)

[so we're going to move this up here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m54s)

[assert on that and then we will do uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m56s)

[suggest box remote execute assert view](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h05m59s)

[model property](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m02s)

[that way it appropriately](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m05s)

[goes and checks it okay if this passes](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m09s)

[we'll just push and approve](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m12s)

[this should get it rocking and rolling](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m27s)

[failed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m35s)

[boy it's always so annoying okay let's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m38s)

[see uh cannot convert](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m41s)

[uh stack panel to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m45s)

[Oh does this thing have a different](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m52s)

[route](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m53s)

[uh I should probably look at what the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m56s)

[other one did](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h06m59s)

[oh it did get element at okay we'll just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m05s)

[we'll just adjust we'll just adjust](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m09s)

[there so get element will recursively](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m13s)

[look down whereas before it was just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m17s)

[calling as which was attempting a hard](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m19s)

[cast](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m21s)

[which then doesn't work so I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m23s)

[in this particular user control there's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m26s)

[a stack panel in the um in the visual](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m28s)

[tree somewhere](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m31s)

[okay so expected bananas but was not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m33s)

[uh let's see here so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m43s)

[let me run this one more time because I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m54s)

[kind of want to watch what it's doing](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h07m57s)

[that's very fast](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m03s)

[let's just slow this sucker down a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m09s)

[little bit um so I can look at that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m11s)

[because the other thing that we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m20s)

[typically do is we'll put um a wait for](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m22s)

[on the the popup or list box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m25s)

[so it types B](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m32s)

[sends keyboard](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m36s)

[enter](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m38s)

[hang on i want to look at this change](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m43s)

[again](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m46s)

[commit value](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m48s)

[i'm a little surprised that this was all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h08m58s)

[that was needed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m02s)

[it's based on this right so send input B](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m09s)

[validate that the elements are found](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m16s)

[which makes sense](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m23s)

[um I'm just not sure i don't see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m27s)

[anything in this test that's actually](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m30s)

[selecting it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m34s)

[so I think what we can do is we can](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m37s)

[actually just do this right so we'll do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m38s)

[B and then we'll do key down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m42s)

[uh key enter](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m48s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m52s)

[do that um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h09m58s)

[we don't need as much of a delay between](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m05s)

[them because I don't I don't know that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m07s)

[we need a delay between the B and the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m09s)

[the running let's check this because](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m12s)

[this should actually get because I don't](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m15s)

[think the other one was actually hitting](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m16s)

[the commit case](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m18s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m22s)

[okay so now I think we can do much](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m25s)

[tighter intervals](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m28s)

[because I don't think it matters that](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m33s)

[much like I I'm not even seeing the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m35s)

[animations](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m37s)

[i am worried though this is hitting the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m48s)

[down case](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m50s)

[is that the same case as the users issue](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h10m55s)

[that gives me a bit of pause because I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m00s)

[want to make sure we are not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m02s)

[because this does increment selection on](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m09s)

[down](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m11s)

[collection view current position move](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m17s)

[so let's let's the other way we test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m29s)

[this if we don't press enter does the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m31s)

[test fail](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m33s)

[right there's a an idea here that you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m35s)

[also should write as little code as](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m38s)

[possible in your test to get it to pass](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m40s)

[okay so without the enter it does just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m43s)

[show the drop down okay so we we need](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m45s)

[all of the things that makes me feel](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m49s)

[better I've often dreamed of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m51s)

[getting something that does a really](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m54s)

[good amount of fuzz testing against my](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m56s)

[library where it uh attempts to remove](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h11m58s)

[things from your tests because in theory](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m01s)

[if you can delete a line from your test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m04s)

[and it doesn't change the output of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m06s)

[test why was it there right there's a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m08s)

[handful of cases where you actually do](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m11s)

[want to keep it right there's some](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m13s)

[pinning or behavioral level things where](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m14s)

[it's like yeah I want it but most of the](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m16s)

[time if you can delete the line without](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m18s)

[changing the outcome of the test you](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m20s)

[should probably delete the line okay so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m21s)

[we added selected item there let's just](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m24s)

[rerun the whole suite of these](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m26s)

[Just want to make sure I I didn't break](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m29s)

[anything else in the autosuggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m30s)

[while we were doing this i don't think](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m32s)

[so because I think Corvin's PR passed](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m36s)

[the rest of the pipeline so](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m39s)

[think it's fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m42s)

[here we go okay this is the other](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m46s)

[disadvantage of these tests they're kind](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m50s)

[of slow because they are functionally UI](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m51s)

[tests oh there we go okay so let's see](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m54s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h12m58s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m01s)

[got rid of the comment updated to latest](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m04s)

[C](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m07s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m09s)

[then we updated the test a little bit](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m12s)

[okay now we go here we go autocode](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m14s)

[button](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m17s)

[let's see add selected item binding to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m19s)

[auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m21s)

[uh no we're not going to no no uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m28s)

[updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m31s)

[uh UI test](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m33s)

[to better](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m36s)

[on the desired behavior uh updated](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m39s)

[some of the test examples to latest C](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m45s)

[syntax](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m51s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h13m56s)

[push it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m02s)

[here we go and that should then](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m05s)

[fix auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m09s)

[once again I feel weird about doing this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m12s)

[but I am going to hit my review on this](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m14s)

[should be fine](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m19s)

[yep looks good to me submit and then we](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m23s)

[are going to come over here and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m27s)

[we are going to enable automerge and it](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m32s)

[is going to be great and awesome and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m35s)

[wonderful and everyone will love it okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m37s)

[or at least I'm going to love it um okay](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m42s)

[so couple things really quick](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m45s)

[see here uh](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m49s)

[okay so oh actually I guess I should go](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m51s)

[back](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m56s)

[so for for people who weren't here](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h14m57s)

[earlier uh if you are at all interested](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m00s)

[uh I will be speaking at a local user](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m03s)

[group June 3rd going through the history](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m05s)

[of C don't worry this is not going to be](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m09s)

[a history lesson this will be much more](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m11s)

[exciting um but kind of that idea of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m13s)

[understanding features I think is often](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m17s)

[times uh useful to understand how we got](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m20s)

[them and where they came from so this is](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m23s)

[going to be a lot of looking back uh a](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m25s)

[little bit of looking at the present and](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m28s)

[a little bit of looking at the future](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m29s)

[because I intend to go all the way up](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m30s)

[through C 14 which releases in November](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m32s)

[so it'll be because C# is open source](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m35s)

[we've got preview bits we can play](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m38s)

[around with latest stuff and see what](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m40s)

[may come uh the .NET team will always](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m42s)

[tell you that they they do not commit to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m46s)

[a feature until they've shipped it um](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m49s)

[but we can at least look at what's](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m52s)

[probably going to land and what they](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m54s)

[expect to be there and we'll see some of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m56s)

[it we may talk to some of it we may show](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h15m59s)

[code but yeah it should be good and fun](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h16m00s)

[and then also um if anyone is going to](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h16m03s)

[as well unfortunately this one will not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m05s)

[be recorded most of the build sessions](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m08s)

[are recorded and live stream so even if](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m10s)

[you aren't able to go there's a wealth](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m12s)

[of knowledge there um it's free to sign](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m14s)

[up for virtual online and you get access](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m16s)

[to all the sessions and or at least all](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m19s)

[the sessions that are recorded some of](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m21s)

[these like community ones are not](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m23s)

[recorded um but if you are in person I](https://youtu.be/ufQEXViSgRk?t=02h17m26s)
