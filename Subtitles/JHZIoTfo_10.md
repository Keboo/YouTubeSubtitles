[time during the week has confused anyone](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m00s)



[my personal life got in the way for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m03s)



[Monday nights and so I have moved it to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m07s)



[Thursday nights at least from here on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m09s)



[out until something else comes up so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m11s)



[just be aware that if you were used to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m13s)



[finding these videos coming up on Monday](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m16s)



[or Tuesday they are now going to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m17s)



[moving to Thursday nights henceforth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m20s)



[moving forward so with that was gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m23s)



[dive in my intention tonight was to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m26s)



[recap a lot of the cool announcements](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m28s)



[from Microsoft ignite there I'll call it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m30s)



[half-year conference there you've got](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m35s)



[Microsoft build a Microsoft ignite which](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m37s)



[are the two big Microsoft conferences](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m39s)



[where all kinds of cool awesome new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m42s)



[stuff gets announced and you get to see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m44s)



[sort of what the future looks like for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m46s)



[Microsoft development and what that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m48s)



[means going forward](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m50s)



[ignite tends to be very developer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m51s)



[focused and all kinds of stuff for I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m54s)



[think they refer to as IT professionals](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m57s)



[typically so there is a whole lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h04m59s)



[announcements and things that have come](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m02s)



[out I'm gonna give a couple highlights](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m04s)



[and then skip over a lot of it I made](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m07s)



[the mistake of not realizing the sheer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m11s)



[magnitude of how much stuff there was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m13s)



[going to be so it's going to be sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m15s)



[a a quick rapid-fire draw of stuff that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m19s)



[I think is cool and then pointing out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m22s)



[other things for if people want to go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m24s)



[dive deeper I'd also wanted to say that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m26s)



[if there's ever any of these topics that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m29s)



[sound interesting to people leave me a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m32s)



[message in the comments I'm happy to go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m34s)



[through and do like a deep dive or even](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m37s)



[just watch me struggle through it one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m38s)



[night and see what we can learn I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m40s)



[always happy to do that and dive in and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m44s)



[see what there is so there's there's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m46s)



[just so much there it's always hard to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m48s)



[know kind of what to start and so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m49s)



[usually I wait until I have something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m51s)



[that looks like a good fit or some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m54s)



[project where I can use it as an excuse](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m56s)



[to learn something new and then dive](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h05m58s)



[into it so with that said](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m00s)



[let's let's start checking out some of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m02s)



[this ignite stuff I got him I got to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m05s)



[move some stuff around here real quick](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m09s)



[because unfortunately this was a very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m11s)



[very busy day for me okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m14s)



[so for those people who are interested](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m18s)



[I've got got shortened links for all](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m24s)



[this stuff so let's flip this over to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m28s)



[that view there so the the key place to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m30s)



[start for anyone who's interested is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m34s)



[just right on the the the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m36s)



[ignite page this kind of gives you the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m39s)



[the overview the the keynotes especially](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m42s)



[the day one keynotes I always find very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m46s)



[fascinating to watch](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m48s)



[they usually kind of set the tone for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m50s)



[the rest of the day of what you what you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m52s)



[can expect to hear from most of the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m54s)



[bigger name sessions all these on-demand](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m56s)



[ones are sort of like the the big center](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h06m58s)



[stage type presentations but there are a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m00s)



[significant number of other sessions](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m04s)



[which we'll get to in a minute so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m06s)



[definitely recommend watching the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m08s)



[keynote there's just a lot of really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m10s)



[cool stuff in there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m12s)



[a lot of it tends to center around Asher](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m13s)



[and all of the latest new offerings](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m16s)



[there specifically I'll drop another](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m20s)



[link to this in here on Azure a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m24s)



[the big highlights come with and I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m28s)



[just bring that guy where'd you go there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m30s)



[you go you go sit over here a lot of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m34s)



[the big highlights come around arc which](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m37s)



[is Microsoft's new offering for allowing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m42s)



[you to take the azure technology stack](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m45s)



[and use it where you're at so what does](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m48s)



[that mean so many people may have some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m51s)



[some level of infrastructure already](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m54s)



[built up in say Amazon's AWS Google](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h07m56s)



[cloud etc but they might want to start](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m00s)



[leveraging some of the azure features as](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m03s)



[your tends to have a lot of really nice](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m06s)



[management utilities and this lets you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m07s)



[start to do that integration and sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m10s)



[get that nice hybrid approach it can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m13s)



[even work with on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m15s)



[stuff they had a really cool demo just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m16s)



[showing bringing a local HP server rack](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m18s)



[online right there and again demo demo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m23s)



[level stuff but the demo host looked](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m25s)



[really really cool so if that's the type](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m27s)



[of stuff that you are interested in and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m31s)



[you've always wanted to have sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m33s)



[that nice as your level of management](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m35s)



[stuff but you you know had](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m37s)



[infrastructure whatnot sitting in a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m40s)



[different cloud and that's where you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m41s)



[were having to work this is definitely](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m43s)



[something that's that's worth looking at](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m45s)



[the other big one as you're synapse you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m47s)



[can think of this as being able to go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m51s)



[through and pull out information from](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m54s)



[big data being able to do those types of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m57s)



[queries where you're you're ingesting](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h08m59s)



[all of this data it's being stored](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m01s)



[somewhere maybe and as your data factory](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m03s)



[data like that kind of thing and you're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m05s)



[looking to you know figure out how how](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m07s)



[can I get more information about my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m09s)



[users how can I Drive this and the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m11s)



[sheer performance that they demoed here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m14s)



[was absolutely amazing I can't remember](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m17s)



[the exact numbers but I want to say they](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m21s)



[were I believe they demoed it with ten](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m25s)



[thousand concurrent queries being run](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m27s)



[and it didn't break a sweat and it was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m29s)



[awesome to see and yeah just the sheer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m31s)



[performance of this looks amazing again](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m35s)



[all of this stuff is new I haven't had a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m39s)



[lot of chance to play with it so I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m41s)



[going entirely based upon what I saw](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m43s)



[demoed and announced so that's sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m45s)



[where we're this is that we'll come back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m48s)



[to some of this the developer breakout](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m51s)



[stuff there's a whole lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m54s)



[around AI and machine learning there's a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h09m58s)



[lot of stuff that they announced around](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m02s)



[like the bot framework and power apps so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m04s)



[if you want to be able to build like how](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m07s)



[a lot of websites have those customer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m11s)



[service help BOTS type things they had](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m14s)



[some really cool demos showing off being](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m16s)



[able to basically build those things out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m20s)



[even if you don't have a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m22s)



[developer knowledge this was a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m25s)



[just really plugging the pieces](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m27s)



[together in Azure a lot of kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m30s)



[WYSIWYG drag-drop type interaction set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m32s)



[it up but even with that it's really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m35s)



[tempting to see even with some of like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m38s)



[the azure logic apps where it's a very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m40s)



[GUI driven you know you can click and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m42s)



[drag and hook things up and see how that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m44s)



[works it's tempting to write those](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m46s)



[things off as like little gimmicky apps](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m48s)



[that oh there's there's no way these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m50s)



[will work at enterprise scale no they](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m52s)



[actually do work really well at](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m54s)



[enterprise scale just because they just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m56s)



[because they have a fancy pretty editor](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h10m59s)



[that doesn't require a lot of technical](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m00s)



[brilliance to work doesn't make them any](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m03s)



[less powerful or any less configurable](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m06s)



[typically on most of the stuff you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m10s)



[dive down to whatever tech level you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m12s)



[want to get to and if you want full](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m15s)



[control and start writing stuff great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m17s)



[otherwise you can go through and do it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m19s)



[so there's a whole bunch of stuff in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m21s)



[here again I'm not gonna I'm not gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m23s)



[try to dive through all of these at](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m25s)



[least this is some of the kind of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m28s)



[high level as your level announcements](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m29s)



[that they that they went through and did](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m32s)



[the other one that I wanted to show off](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m34s)



[because I mentioned it a minute ago](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m36s)



[just the sheer the shirt counts so if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m39s)



[you go through and open up sessions](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m42s)



[right and you look it'll it'll take you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m43s)



[here and you can scroll down and I want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m49s)



[you to note something the sheer number](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m51s)



[of sessions that there are for Microsoft](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m56s)



[ignite that is a lot there is a ton of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h11m59s)



[stuff here and a ton of information my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m03s)



[naiveness thinking that I could you know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m07s)



[get through even a small chunk of this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m09s)



[was laughably bad it's gonna take me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m12s)



[weeks to even just go through all of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m15s)



[sessions and stuff that interests me so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m18s)



[but with that said there is there are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m21s)



[some really cool stuff so because you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m23s)



[are watching my stream I'm guessing that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m26s)



[you're probably interested in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m28s)



[potentially WPF type stuff so we'll go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m29s)



[through here because this is a this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m32s)



[at least a more manageable set of stuff](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m34s)



[it's like okay I get down to WPF and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m35s)



[this this brings me forward to okay how](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m38s)



[can I bring my my app for it a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m40s)



[the WPF session](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m42s)



[from ignite Center on how do I take my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m43s)



[app and bring it forward to dotnet core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m47s)



[if or even answering the question of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m49s)



[should I bring it forward to dotnet core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m52s)



[and the answer is not necessarily always](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m54s)



[it really depends on what what benefits](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h12m57s)



[you're looking to gain from dotnet core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m02s)

[that stuff so for people with existing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m16s)

[dotnet core so unless you have some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m28s)



[something that's forcing you to go back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m31s)



[to framework some unusual dependency](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m33s)



[that you can't change](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m35s)



[I would I would highly recommend going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m36s)



[to core for everything because just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h13m39s)

[being able to you know pop your chat](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m14s)

[would have considered basic level](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m20s)



[productivity features that have been](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m21s)

[be fixed and or getting fixed in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m27s)



[near future there is a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m29s)



[integration that they showed off with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m32s)



[being able to do linked teams into like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m34s)



[your outlook to be able to do like take](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m37s)



[advantage of the Microsoft graph so you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m41s)



[know two people can collaborate the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m43s)



[editing the same document ones in a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m45s)

[email open and outlook they're both](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m50s)



[editing something and you know you see a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m51s)



[graph update in real time all those kind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m53s)



[of cool level collaboration type demos](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m55s)



[so lots of cool stuff they're trying to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h15m58s)



[think of what else so the the other one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m02s)



[that that really excited me so Visual](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m04s)



[Studio code is an electron app it is by](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m07s)



[far my lightweight code editor or slash](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m12s)



[text editor of choice because you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m15s)



[pull plugins in for it it works with I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m18s)



[think every language Under the Sun and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m20s)



[then probably a few extras so very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m22s)



[powerful but it's it's an electron app](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m27s)



[runs cross-platform you can get on Mac](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m30s)



[Linux Windows and they all just kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m31s)



[work but what they've done is they've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m34s)



[taken that one step further and said](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m37s)



[okay you know getting a developer's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m39s)



[environment set up getting the IDE](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m41s)



[configured all of that kind of stuff is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m43s)



[time consuming and difficult wouldn't it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m45s)



[be great if we could just do that on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m48s)



[demand it's like you yes that would be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m50s)



[wonderful yes please](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m53s)



[so that is what they've done you can go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m54s)



[and sign up for this right now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h16m57s)



[it is online visual studio comm and once](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m00s)



[you walk through the the signup process](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m05s)



[it'll-it'll bring you into a place here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m09s)



[I've got I've got an environment set up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m10s)



[here you'll you'll need to set it up and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m12s)



[create a plan so specifically these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m14s)



[plans want to be linked to an azure](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m16s)



[subscription because these things are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m19s)



[going to start as your resources to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m21s)



[able to do this so just just be aware of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m24s)



[that but if you don't have an azure](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m27s)



[account you can sign up for a free one I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m28s)



[don't remember exactly what the benefits](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m31s)



[are for the free accounts but at least](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m33s)



[for the first 12 months you get I think](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m35s)



[it's like $100 a month of azure](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m38s)



[resources and these things can be cheap](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m40s)



[cheapish it mean everything depends on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m44s)



[usage but you will need to set up a plan](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m46s)



[for people with MS D and subscriptions](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m50s)



[you should already have an azure account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m52s)



[and if you haven't activated but so once](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h17m55s)



[you once you get this guy tied into your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m00s)



[as your account I set mine up in West](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m02s)



[u.s. - because geographically that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m04s)



[closest to me and then you can go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m05s)



[through and create an environment so an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m08s)



[environment is going to be set up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m10s)



[basically for you can imagine this as my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m13s)



[working set up for a project that I'm on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m17s)



[right so in this case you can point it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m19s)



[to a git repository give it a name and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m22s)



[then it's worth noting that right now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m25s)



[you're kind of limited on what you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m28s)



[debug and run in here pretty much](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m31s)



[anything that runs cross platting or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m34s)



[doing in vs code previously should be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m37s)



[supported all right so but you'll notice](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m41s)



[the the instance type that you're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m43s)



[spinning up is Linux VMs so just be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m45s)



[aware if you're expecting to do WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m49s)



[development I can't confirm this but I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m51s)



[when I tried to you know do something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m55s)



[fancy with that earlier no worky which](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h18m58s)



[sort of makes sense based on the fact](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m01s)



[that this is really expected to be maybe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m02s)



[web type development dotnet core asp net](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m05s)



[core scripting type level stuff that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m09s)



[kind of thing so expect that you could](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m13s)



[stand one of these things up in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m16s)



[cloud and then more importantly it's got](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m17s)



[this awesome little feature like if you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m19s)



[were to go through and create these VM](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m20s)



[Stan](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m22s)



[them up there's a common problem we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m22s)



[in Azure you stood up a VM you forgot to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m26s)



[bring down a resource you can log in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m28s)



[next day and you notice your credits](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m30s)



[it's just sure something has been eating](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m31s)



[them up all night](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m34s)



[well this wonderful little guy will go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m35s)



[through and suspend your environment](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m36s)



[after a certain amount of inactivity so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m39s)



[I've got mine set low just to try to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m40s)



[keep it from going but you can have this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m43s)



[thing automatically basically shut](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m45s)



[itself down so let's take a look at what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m47s)



[it ends up doing so I've got one here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m49s)



[that already set up I pointed it at this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m51s)



[this git repo it's a very simple project](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m55s)



[this is a dotnet core command line](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h19m57s)



[application you've actually seen it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m02s)



[running if you watch any of my streams](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m05s)



[when I first start up and you it says](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m06s)



[stream starting in you know X period of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m09s)



[time that's this little app running](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m11s)



[basically all it does is watch the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m14s)



[current clock and update a file so it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m16s)



[not real fancy but it lets me go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m18s)



[and you know get that fancy little setup](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m21s)



[going so we've got that guy going and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m23s)



[then it logs me and away we go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m26s)



[and we'll see how well this guy gets](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m31s)



[going that is not the that's not where](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m34s)



[we wanted to be there we go what I get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m43s)



[for clicking on things okay so loading](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m46s)



[loading loading loading loading loading](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m50s)



[loading I have this loaded earlier and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m52s)



[then it's been more than five minutes so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m54s)



[it did what it was supposed to shut down](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m56s)



[so it will walk you through the basic](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h20m58s)



[setups of creating like a launch profile](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m00s)



[and that kind of thing so for people who](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m03s)



[have done work with dotnet core in V s](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m05s)



[code this should feel very familiar to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m08s)



[you you've got your terminal your debug](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m10s)



[so let's see here so let's CD in here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m14s)



[and we can do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m18s)



[now run let's just go and look at this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m21s)



[real quick so running countdown and it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m31s)



[gonna output a file path it's got this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m35s)



[is using a nougat package from system](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m38s)



[command line called dragonfruit to give](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m41s)



[me a strongly typed main method so it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m43s)



[automatically generates command line](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m45s)



[arguments from all of this stuff but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m48s)



[you'll notice it when I did dotnet run](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m50s)



[running countdown to you know empty](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m53s)



[countdown time because it was given](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m56s)



[nothing so it defaulted to null and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h21m59s)



[it picked up the path for output file](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m01s)



[path and away we go and we have a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m03s)



[running application in the web and I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m06s)



[didn't have to do any setup on my own](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m10s)



[local machine I don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m12s)



[about pulling down NuGet packages I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m14s)



[don't have to worry about NPM installs](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m16s)



[all of that stuff just gets magically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m18s)



[handled for me up in the cloud I can do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m20s)



[my editing and debugging here and it all](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m23s)



[just works it's got access to all of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m25s)



[Visual Studio code features here so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m31s)



[where we got here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m35s)



[did to do so extensions for example if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m37s)



[you want say PowerShell you can go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m41s)



[through grab the PowerShell hit install](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m45s)



[and next thing you know we've got](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m48s)



[PowerShell right into our environment](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m51s)



[it's got to relaunch because just like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m54s)



[vs code relaunches after you install an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m57s)



[extension same thing here but it reloads](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h22m59s)



[pulls it in and away you go and you now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m02s)



[have a more powerful web-based vs code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m05s)



[instance for your repo so this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m10s)



[probably quickly going to become my tool](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m12s)



[of choice for dealing with git repos](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m15s)



[online especially when I don't want to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m18s)



[pull down dependencies or set up my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m20s)



[machine to to be configured correctly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m22s)



[because it is always obnoxious when you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m26s)



[realize oh shoot to compile this project](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m28s)



[I don't have the right tool chain](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m30s)



[installed I got to you know open up the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m32s)



[Visual Studio installer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m34s)



[loaded in the right workload or I've got](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m35s)



[to pull down this dependency or that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m37s)



[dependency that gets him not just quick](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m38s)



[this is awesome](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m40s)



[absolutely awesome and the fact that it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m42s)



[was so easy to get set up and running](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m45s)



[made me very very happy so it definitely](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m47s)



[there are times where it feels a little](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m51s)



[new and some of it could just be my lack](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m53s)



[of really advanced debugging envious](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h23m58s)



[code I tend to use it more as a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m02s)



[lightweight editor rather than a full](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m03s)



[IDE and so I think I just need to up my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m05s)



[Visual Studio code game and see and see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m09s)



[what this can do so again I I think this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m13s)



[is amazing the fact that it even ties in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m16s)



[with git source control and everything](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m18s)



[here is awesome](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m21s)



[the one thing I did notice I ended up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m23s)



[having to change my CS proj this app was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m26s)



[targeting to to at least down here when](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m28s)



[I run if I can type dot net - - version](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m32s)



[it looks like it comes with two one set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m37s)



[up but I did notice that it's possible](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m40s)



[let's just bounce back here on your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m43s)



[environment you can go through and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m46s)



[launch it with the the preview version](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m48s)



[so to do open in vs code insiders so I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m52s)



[not in time let's just click ah](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m57s)



[so this tries to open up locally in my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h24m59s)



[vs code instance mmm don't know why that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m02s)



[button says accept so this gives me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m06s)



[access to a local ones interesting even](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m12s)



[cooler or I can manually just hit the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m14s)



[suspend button and put the thing to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m17s)



[sleep right away so but as far as being](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m19s)



[able to stand up an environment in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m21s)



[cloud and get it running this was one of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m23s)



[the announcements that really got me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m25s)



[excited very quickly so let's carry on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m27s)



[here real quick because I so much cool](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m32s)



[stuff so much cool stuff so one of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m35s)



[other things and let me find I meant to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m37s)



[have this blog post up already did](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m41s)



[there is when UI 3 so this is this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m47s)



[sort of the let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m53s)



[you know I will drop the link for this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m55s)



[in the chat as well so this is another](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h25m58s)



[one of those new features that's that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m00s)



[coming coming down the pipe so it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m02s)



[worth mentioning right away this is an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m05s)



[alpha this is not something you should](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m07s)



[go and build build an app in today it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m10s)



[something you should play with and the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m12s)



[Microsoft team would really love](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m14s)



[feedback in fact just to get the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m16s)



[downloader for the visits to get this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m19s)



[thing running they do ask that you fill](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m21s)



[out a survey that's the only requirement](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m23s)



[to actually download the Alpha is you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m25s)



[know give Microsoft some feedback on who](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m28s)



[you are and what type of what types of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m30s)



[apps you build and where you think you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m32s)



[might use this because getting that kind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m33s)



[of information is very valuable to them](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m35s)



[so that is the low low cost of what it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m37s)



[takes to download win UI 3 right now but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m39s)



[what is when UI 3 so right now you've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m43s)



[got sort of the separation between uwp](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m46s)



[application the universal Windows](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m50s)



[platform and WPF application right WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m51s)



[applications can either target net core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m56s)



[3 or full framework they they tend to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h26m59s)



[these larger ones but the uwp](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m03s)



[application has a lot of the newer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m06s)



[advancements that Microsoft is putting](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m09s)



[in so a lot of the the gooey stuff like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m11s)



[the material layout that you see all](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m13s)



[over Windows 10 and in various apps](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m16s)



[that's that's coming from uwp](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m18s)



[applications the there's sort of this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m22s)



[area where you want to take advantage of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m27s)



[the newer features in uwp while inside](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m29s)



[of your WPF application and previously](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m32s)



[what you had was sam'l islands which let](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m35s)



[you sort of pull in that content and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m37s)



[make use of it but what they're what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m39s)



[they're trying to do is consolidate that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m42s)



[even further because that still isn't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m45s)



[that's really sort of an interrupt type](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m48s)



[solution of being able to pull in those](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m50s)



[features and when UI 3 aims to take that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m53s)



[a step further so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m56s)



[there was another thing called when you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h27m59s)



[I - that came before three but when you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m01s)



[I too was really just around controls](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m05s)



[and themes for uwp applications to use](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m08s)



[it inside of WPF you had you go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m11s)



[the zamel islands it was doable yeah not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m13s)



[quite as great when you i3 is not just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m16s)



[controls and styling this is actually a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m20s)



[GUI rendering framework that you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m24s)



[build on top of that that sort of aims](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m27s)



[to bring things together this is the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m29s)



[best way I can describe it to be able to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m33s)



[actually go through and build out your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m37s)



[apps so if you are considering building](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m40s)



[a new app and you want to play around](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m44s)



[with something the the latest and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m46s)



[greatest stuff this is worth giving a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m48s)



[try again this is an alpha I have I've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m50s)



[downloaded I haven't even gotten to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m54s)



[running it yet but so be aware it is it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h28m55s)



[looks really cool it it looks to be a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m00s)



[really great way of trying to modernize](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m04s)



[WPF applications and take advantage of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m09s)



[all of the the all of the benefits and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m12s)



[perks that you WP apps benefit from and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m16s)



[I'm really looking forward to to giving](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m20s)



[it a try so but again alpha and yeah](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m23s)



[links in the chat for anybody who wants](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m28s)



[to see it again these are one of those](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m31s)



[things that if people are interested in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m33s)



[knowing more I am happy to do more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m35s)



[streaming on this and we can muddle](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m37s)



[through it together and see where that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m40s)



[leads so I think is that enough](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m42s)



[Microsoft ignite stuff there there was a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m46s)



[lot a lot of stuff there I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m48s)



[think if there was anything else that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m50s)



[caught my eye over the last few days](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m52s)



[which is boiling through all of this I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m55s)



[was unfortunately not able to go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m57s)



[as many of the sessions as I wanted to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h29m59s)



[ahead of time like I said it's gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m01s)



[take me weeks to get through this but it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m03s)



[is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m06s)



[it is awesome so I think I think I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m07s)



[call call it therefore the the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m12s)



[ignite stuff and one second I'm just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m15s)



[realizing I'm just realizing the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m18s)



[baby monitor that I was supposed to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m23s)



[manning is powered off and not doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m25s)



[what it's supposed to so that's that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m29s)



[not a good thing we'll see we can fix](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m32s)



[that real quick okay so going back to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m35s)



[something that looks like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m41s)



[let's see close close close close close](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m44s)



[close close let me pull you up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m46s)



[pull you up so back to material design](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m49s)



[in sam'l and where we are going here so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m54s)



[there was there was a question that came](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h30m58s)



[through the Gator chat probably last](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m00s)



[week at some point around the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m02s)



[dialogue host and how do how to properly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m06s)



[use it specifically wanting to swap out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m10s)



[the content so I started thinking about](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m13s)



[it and and came to the conclusion that a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m17s)



[reasonable example for this might be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m21s)



[when you are working with like a login](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m22s)



[screen so you know maybe the users are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m27s)



[forced to login to an application but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m29s)



[then there's you know the create account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m32s)



[button](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m33s)



[and so that login screen switches and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m33s)



[then becomes the you know create new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m36s)



[account screen and then moves forward so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m38s)



[that was where I started with the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m40s)



[example and so up here there is a grab](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m42s)



[the link so here is for anyone who](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m48s)



[hasn't seen it this is a github repo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m51s)



[where I load it up with examples this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m53s)



[largely comes from when somebody asked](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m56s)



[me a question and I think it would be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h31m58s)



[easiest to to show code for it this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m00s)



[what where I put it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m03s)



[so let's see four five one make things](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m04s)



[bigger okay so if you haven't checked it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m08s)



[out there's also a link to this this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m12s)



[repo and the material design readme but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m14s)



[but that's what that was the question](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m17s)



[with the dialog host](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m19s)



[that I was going to want to go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m20s)



[and do so I started up this new dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m22s)



[host changing content project right so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m25s)



[let's let's fire this guy up and we'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m29s)



[see what it's doing to do so this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m30s)



[targeting dotnet core 3 but there's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m35s)



[nothing in here that is dotnet core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m39s)



[specific could just as easily be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m42s)



[targeting dotnet framework it does mean](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m45s)



[that I am on preview builds of material](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m48s)



[design in zamel so I'm on a three o](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m53s)



[nightly builds and right now this code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h32m56s)



[behind button is the only one that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m00s)



[hooked up so we we click the code-behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m02s)



[button and it pulls up something that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m04s)



[looks kind of like a login screen right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m06s)



[so you've got your username a password a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m08s)



[login button a cancel and then something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m10s)



[that says you know click here to create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m13s)



[a new account you click it it brings you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m14s)



[into here you've got you know username](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m17s)



[password](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m19s)



[reenter password create account cancel](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m20s)



[so it's worth noting none of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m22s)



[buttons are actually hooked up to logic](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m24s)



[right now right these ones are basically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m26s)



[just set up to close the dialog there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m28s)



[are other examples in here about closing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m31s)



[dialogues getting return values that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m33s)



[kind of thing I try to keep these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m35s)



[examples as isolated and focused on one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m37s)



[specific problem as I can and so in this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m41s)



[case we're going to focus on changing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m43s)



[this content out I'm also noticing that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m46s)



[this guy here is click here to create a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m48s)



[new account and it's cropped so let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m51s)



[just jump in here real quick why why is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m55s)



[that getting cropped I did to do so that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h33m58s)



[is login control Oh probably because my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m03s)



[width is hard-coded how about min-width](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m06s)



[rather than width let's do the same](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m11s)



[thing over here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m14s)



[that way it's allowed to scale in size](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m15s)



[hey look at that now we aren't clipping](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m18s)



[our team now I have the whole button yay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m20s)



[so okay so that gets us into there that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m24s)



[works there we've got a back button I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m28s)



[kind of want to change out the way this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m30s)



[back button is being done I might do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m32s)



[that real quick and then we're then I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m35s)



[looking to go through and do the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m37s)



[mvvm example because there's sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m39s)



[very different approaches when it comes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m42s)



[to dealing with swapping the content and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m45s)



[this is sort of a fundamental](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m48s)



[architecture thing some people really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m49s)



[like mvvm and I would say it's probably](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m52s)



[the dominant view for people doing WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m54s)



[applications it's I my personal opinion](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h34m57s)



[is it is a significant learning curve](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m01s)



[and it's well worth doing most of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m04s)



[features in WPF are built around the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m07s)



[idea of bindings and templates and that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m09s)



[kind of thing and it really lends itself](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m12s)



[well to an mvvm style and layout now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m14s)



[with that said it is a learning curve it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m18s)



[adds a lot of complexity but again I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m20s)



[think it is worth it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m23s)



[other people prefer the straight-up code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m24s)



[behind which basically says I don't want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m26s)



[any fancy bindings I want to just write](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m29s)



[c-sharp code I want to wire up to you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m32s)



[know my click button handlers and I want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m34s)



[stuff to go when I do it sure you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m36s)



[build it either way and you can find](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m40s)



[some happy median in the middle if you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m42s)



[want I think the if you get right in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m44s)



[middle it gets a little obnoxious to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m47s)



[read because then you're confused but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m48s)



[whatever pick what makes you happy or I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m51s)



[should say pick whatever you can be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m56s)



[productive with that's probably a better](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m57s)



[choice oh let's see so they create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h35m59s)



[account control so right here this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m02s)



[the this thing up here is the back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m04s)



[button and this is what's making me a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m07s)



[little less happy mostly because this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m09s)



[a stackpanel with a mouse down handler](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m12s)



[and a hand and that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m14s)



[it's one thing that's worth noting with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m17s)



[material design this whole concept of a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m19s)



[cursor really doesn't exist right it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m22s)



[it was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m25s)



[built for Android and the idea of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m26s)



[changing a cursor makes the big sweeping](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m29s)



[assumption that there is a cursor which](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m33s)



[isn't really true in a lot of touched](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m36s)



[based environments so even on Windows if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m38s)



[you're running on a touch-based machine](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m41s)



[things that rely on changing the cursor](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m43s)



[or hover type effects are pretty much](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m46s)



[meaningless when it comes to touch so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m49s)



[the way material design handles it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m52s)



[rather than dealing with sort of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m55s)



[hover effects they try to give feedback](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m57s)



[when things occur so like when you tap](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h36m59s)



[on something you'll see that ripple](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m01s)



[effect where it kind of bubbles out from](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m03s)



[wherever your click point was which you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m06s)



[get with the material design buttons](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m08s)



[there's a built-in ripple control that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m10s)



[that handles that for you so that's the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m12s)



[better way of handling it and I did this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m14s)



[late at night and the next morning I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m16s)



[realized that was dumb and meant made a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m20s)



[mental note to come back and fix it so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m23s)



[the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m24s)



[gonna just grab this real quick because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m26s)



[I want to use one of the let's see that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m29s)



[was the create account control I want to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m31s)



[use one of the optional button styles so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m32s)



[this is documented in the wiki and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m35s)



[actually I'm gonna grab I'll put this in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m40s)



[real quick and then we'll go back and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m45s)



[explain it so let's see resource](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m47s)



[dictionary resource dictionary merge](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m48s)



[dictionaries paste and then I just know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m52s)



[that by convention I can change this to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m55s)



[button and it works alright and the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h37m57s)



[squiggly lines are because I'm debugging](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m00s)



[and you can only make so many joints](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m01s)



[choices changes Wow that was a lot](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m03s)



[harder than it needed to be ok so if you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m07s)



[go to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m12s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m12s)



[that that will drop you on to my blog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m15s)



[which right now when I write blogs](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m20s)



[I'm just publishing them on my company's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m23s)



[website because they have a blog and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m26s)



[they like it when when we write content](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m28s)



[and so I like writing content and so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m30s)



[when I can do it I do so so the the one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m33s)



[in question here is this five steps to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m36s)



[getting started with material design in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m38s)



[zamel and specifically it says five](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m39s)



[steps but really there's four so you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m44s)



[know there's one two three do all the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m46s)



[stuff set up the defaults and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m48s)



[there's five so this is beyond the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m51s)



[default style so in this case we don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m54s)



[if we just do the normal button we get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m57s)



[sort of that coloured button like what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h38m59s)



[you saw for the create and cancel](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m00s)



[buttons but for this back button we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m02s)



[don't want it to be that nice brightly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m04s)



[colored we want it to be more of a flat](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m06s)



[button style so Mountain Dew first](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m08s)



[Mountain Dew is important to be able to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m15s)



[use the alternate styles for a control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m20s)



[you have to bring in the the resource](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m22s)



[dictionary that contains those styles so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m25s)



[inside of the material design library it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m28s)



[basically means this big long string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m29s)



[here and you just swap out this last](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m32s)



[part for the name of the control so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m34s)



[button checkbox text box etc so whatever](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m36s)



[control you're looking for you can just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m39s)



[put that name right here and it'll get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m41s)



[it so because you ended up having to set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m43s)



[this dictionary in your apt sam'l for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m46s)



[the default control styles if you want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m48s)



[one of the optional ones you just change](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m50s)



[this default in to you know control name](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m52s)



[here and away you go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m55s)



[so specifically what I'm looking for is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m57s)



[I want a button and I want style I want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h39m59s)



[static resource I want material design](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m03s)



[or spine tella sense come on guys](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m09s)



[where's my intellisense not helpful I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m13s)



[gonna go grab the demo out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m17s)



[two dudes see here so it for anybody](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m18s)



[who's looking for it to do see material](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m23s)



[design toolkit so from the releases page](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m28s)



[on the github repo you can go and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m33s)



[download the demo application and fire](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m35s)



[it up and for anybody who's ever curious](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m42s)



[about you know what's all in this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m44s)



[library sort of what's in the box what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m46s)



[what do I get to use this is usually the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m48s)



[easiest place to do it I try to make](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m50s)



[sure that we've got at least one example](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m52s)



[of anything cool in the library but more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m53s)



[importantly what I am after is our flat](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h40m57s)



[button style which I believe is this one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m00s)



[here that's outlined buttoned this one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m02s)



[this is what I want so you click this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m06s)



[little zamel icon in the corner and it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m09s)



[says here here is the magical stuff that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m13s)



[you need in Psych why thank you this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m15s)



[exactly what I want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m17s)



[poof then you go and paste it into your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m19s)



[app no way you go it is worth noting in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m22s)



[the demo app it doesn't it doesn't show](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m25s)



[you this any secondary resource](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m28s)



[dictionaries that it needs so you sort](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m31s)



[of have to divine that because this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m34s)



[on a button that this needs it I have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m36s)



[thoughts about going through and trying](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m39s)



[to figure out a nice way of displaying](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m42s)



[that so that when you click this button](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m43s)



[that it shows you kind of up at the top](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m45s)



[of hey you need the following resource](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m48s)



[dictionary merged in and you know click](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m50s)



[here to copy and paste that kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m52s)



[thing but have not gotten there yet](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m54s)



[okay so this guy here I'm gonna take my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h41m57s)



[stack panel I'm gonna just drop it right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m00s)



[inside the button I'm gonna turn off](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m02s)



[that turn off that don't want a cursor](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m04s)



[set don't really think I need the margin](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m09s)



[either](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m13s)



[they're basically just doing this so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m15s)



[that I can get the new event handler](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m17s)



[great and take me do it and let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m23s)



[let's just refactor this so ctrl R R to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m33s)



[get to the refactor menu I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m37s)



[just rename this to back just so it's a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m39s)



[little more clear and then this is the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m43s)



[magical code behind stuff for being able](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m46s)



[to change it so if you are working in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m48s)



[the code behind or you're in a state](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m52s)



[where you've got a direct reference to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m53s)



[your dialogue host so in this case we do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m56s)



[I've got it right here I passed it in so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h42m58s)



[this control has a direct reference to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m02s)



[the dialogue host so you can grab the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m04s)



[current session off the dialogue host](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m07s)



[and then this dialogue session object](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m09s)



[has a method on it for update content so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m11s)



[if you want to just swap out content](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m14s)



[that's sitting inside of an already](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m17s)



[existing or an already open dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m19s)



[host this is how you do it it's worth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m22s)



[noting you can't you can't just call](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m24s)



[show multiple times and expect that to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m26s)



[work so if there's an existing session](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m29s)



[meaning that there is a dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m31s)



[presented you need and you want to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m33s)



[change its content you need to call](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m35s)



[update content okay so let's fire that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m37s)



[up and this should this should hopefully](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m40s)



[look a lot better and then we'll go do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m42s)



[the mvvm side](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m43s)



[I might even get hugely motivated and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m49s)



[switch this over to I want to do an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m55s)



[example of one of these projects doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h43m59s)



[multi targeting because you can't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m01s)



[actually compile your app for both WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m03s)



[and dotnet core and then I guess the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m06s)



[demo app and the main repo shows it it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m12s)



[just feels like that's I hate using the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m16s)



[demo app as an example of how to do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m18s)



[coding things because the demo app is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m20s)



[really designed to show the breadth of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m22s)



[what's possible in the library not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m24s)



[necessarily best practices because in a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m26s)



[real app you should not use all the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m29s)



[coding styles which the demo app does](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m32s)



[use all the coding styles because it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m34s)



[trying to show you everything that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m36s)



[possible so buyer beware if you're if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m37s)



[you're copying code out of the demo app](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m43s)



[just be aware that I would not build an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m44s)



[app like that in general](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m46s)



[because again it's designed to show you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m47s)



[everything that's possible](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m50s)



[not necessarily best practices so like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m52s)



[this one here we're gonna end up doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m55s)



[two different things](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m57s)



[I would not build an app with both code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h44m58s)



[behind and the mvvm and then I would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m01s)



[probably tend to favor one over the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m03s)



[other so okay so code behind up new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m05s)



[account option oh that's not bad aside](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m11s)



[from I want that I want that thing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m14s)



[aligned better](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m17s)



[so it's let's see horizontal alignment](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m18s)



[left that's better](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m23s)



[2:32 kind of wanna offset this guy up a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m30s)



[little bit because this guy so this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m36s)



[padding here is what's ultimately](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m38s)



[bringing the thing all the way in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m40s)



[and I kind of want this thing to sit up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m46s)



[and outside of it so let's do maybe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m50s)



[they're there something like that that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h45m57s)



[looks a little nicer so yeah it is worth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m06s)



[noting the margins and padding's can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m11s)



[technically have negative values it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m14s)



[just worth being aware that sometimes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m16s)



[this can cause clipping depending on how](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m18s)



[you use them because just you know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m21s)



[shifting something left or up doesn't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m22s)



[always work let's see here is that seems](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m26s)



[fine yeah that seems fine and then the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m32s)



[back button takes us back great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m37s)



[okay so let's real quick everybody's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m39s)



[favorite get tool get crackin welcome](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m44s)



[back get crackin](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m47s)



[I did run into an issue with it with get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m48s)



[crackin the other week I think it was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m51s)



[last week and I contacted their support](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m53s)



[because I was having an issue where my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m55s)



[might get interactions were taking like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h46m58s)



[a minute to do a commit they they walked](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m00s)



[me through some kind of debugging steps](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m05s)



[to try stuff and ultimately what ended](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m06s)



[up fixing the problem is walking my my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m09s)



[local clone Andry cloning the repo so we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m12s)



[tried various you know get commands for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m15s)



[cleanup and garbage collection and that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m17s)



[kind of thing and nothing seemed to fix](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m20s)



[it but I'm guessing it must have been](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m22s)



[something because a lot of times like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m23s)



[I'll have Visual Studio or something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m25s)



[interacting with the same repo so just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m27s)



[be aware if you're running get cracking](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m31s)



[a to get slow try a fresh clone your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m33s)



[life might get happier](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m36s)



[okay so fixed](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m37s)



[hood behind example great it sounds](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m42s)



[wonderful](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m46s)



[okay so let's do an MV vmstat one so I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m47s)



[want to end up with and I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m50s)



[what I'm gonna do here is just start](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m53s)



[namespacing some of this stuff off](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m56s)



[because I want to stop debugging because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h47m59s)



[I want it to be really obvious since I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m03s)



[putting multiple styles into the same](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m05s)



[project which goes with which obviously](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m07s)



[unlike the main window that's gonna be a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m11s)



[little harder but let's see code behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m12s)



[and see folder and the VM okay so these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m16s)



[guys these two guys here going to the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m25s)



[code-behind bucket yep](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m27s)



[move them Thanks and I think see here I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m29s)



[I think if I go into the code behind and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m37s)



[do the rename on the sink if I let move](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m39s)



[contents to namespace that's not what I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m45s)



[want I want to change the namespace](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m47s)



[let's see dot](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h48m50s)



[you're gonna make me go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m02s)



[gonna make me go and change this in both](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m06s)



[places you are aren't you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m08s)



[you jerk okay fine I'll change it so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m10s)



[that goes there see it will change this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m15s)



[guy here it's probably gonna go and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m18s)



[break everything else but that's okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m21s)



[and back in main window let's see here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m25s)



[that's probably fine so it's just the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m29s)



[code behind it probably needs to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m32s)



[updated for this because this guy's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m35s)



[namespace now we're located so add that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m37s)



[for me please and then let's see control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m40s)



[art no control RG to clean up my extra](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m44s)



[using statements and away we go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m48s)



[okay that gets us there so let's go back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m50s)



[on so for mvvm there's a couple pieces](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m54s)



[that are worth noting so first and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m57s)



[foremost is we need a view model and in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h49m59s)



[this case I'm going to separate out my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m02s)



[login dialog from my create account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m05s)



[dialog there are many ways you could go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m10s)



[about doing this it is very possible](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m14s)



[that you have a single view model and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m16s)



[you know you just change a state flag or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m17s)



[whatnot for the purposes of showing two](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m19s)



[separate things I'm going to separate](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m23s)



[them so let's see login view model and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m25s)



[by convention I usually try to end my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m30s)



[view model class names with the words](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m32s)



[view model so we'll just do that do that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m35s)



[and then let's see what class create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m40s)



[count model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m45s)



[all right and then move you to your own](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m50s)



[file please](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m53s)



[okay so then back on our main window we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m55s)



[want to implement this button here the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h50m59s)



[mvvm one so we're just gonna grab and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m00s)



[register up a click new event handler](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m03s)



[and I'm wondering if maybe I should do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m08s)



[this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m11s)



[maybe I shouldn't do this with a click](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m15s)



[handler maybe I should let's do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m17s)



[with a view model as well so let's do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m19s)



[this and this is where it's gonna get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m22s)



[weird because I'm gonna have this main](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m24s)



[window in a state where I'm both using](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m25s)



[the the view model as well as the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m28s)



[code-behind for both and again I would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m31s)



[not recommend building an app this way](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m35s)



[this is just for the purposes of showing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m36s)



[nvvm versus code-behind and how you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m38s)



[would structure it for this so let's go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m42s)



[back here add new class main window view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m44s)



[model great that sounds fun ok so class](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m51s)



[now for doing these up trying to decide](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h51m59s)



[if i implement a basic view model class](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m07s)



[or if i pull in something like mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m11s)



[light not sure which is which so for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m13s)



[people who are interested in knowing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m17s)



[more about it the and this might be the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m19s)



[way we do it this is sort of the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m22s)



[blog post that i tend to point people to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m25s)



[for people who are just sort of getting](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m28s)



[started and trying to figure out should](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m30s)



[I do mvvm should I do code behind what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m32s)



[what to learn this is basically I said](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m35s)



[that I'm not really going to go into it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m40s)



[there's also another stream that I've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m42s)



[done out on my youtube channel for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m43s)



[people who are interested in that so if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m49s)



[you search for simply budget on let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m52s)



[see here it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h52m58s)



[that so but basically what we're looking](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m02s)



[to do is is build out this let's just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m06s)



[let's just implement our own real quick](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m10s)

[give me a view model base uh that'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m20s)



[work didn't really want the line numbers](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m24s)



[but thanks let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m26s)



[Auto format and then let's just start](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m29s)



[moving you around movie to your own file](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m34s)



[and we'll just go through and implement](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m38s)



[this real quick so the short version is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m42s)



[for mvvm in general you usually end up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m44s)



[with some sort of base class for your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m48s)



[view models because this sort of logic](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m49s)



[that you end up needing for all of your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m53s)



[for all of your interaction usually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h53m57s)



[follows this exact same pattern the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m01s)



[other thing that is unfortunately not in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m02s)



[the box is a built-in command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m06s)



[implementation so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m08s)



[grab this one this will do paste](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m10s)



[I should look around for that copy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m20s)



[button because this will serve our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m22s)



[purposes nicely because rather than](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m25s)



[click handlers in mvvm the way the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m28s)



[view classes like your user controls](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m31s)



[tell you that something should happen is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m34s)



[through the commands that's the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m36s)



[primary mechanism so when a button is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m39s)



[clicked it invokes a command on your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m40s)



[view model and says hey I was clicked](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m43s)



[please go do action you know login or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m45s)



[whatever alright so we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m48s)



[move this out so move type to delegate](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m50s)



[can be great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m53s)



[so got a little bit of a base I should](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m56s)



[probably put these in some shared](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h54m59s)



[project I know I've got a shared thing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m00s)



[down here at some point for utilities](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m03s)



[should look at doing that at some point](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m07s)



[anyway](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m08s)



[normally my my weapon of choice for this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m10s)



[in a lot of cases is mvvm light they](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m13s)



[have a view model based class with a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m16s)



[member on it that looks almost identical](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m19s)



[to this same with they don't call it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m22s)



[delegate command they call it relay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m25s)



[command but it's basically very similar](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m27s)



[they use you know fancy weak references](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m29s)



[rather than strong references but unless](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m32s)



[you actually care about the subtle](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m35s)



[differences they're functionally you use](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m37s)



[them the same way ok so we've got that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m39s)



[so main window view model so we're going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m43s)



[to do a public eye command show login](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m46s)



[dialog right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m52s)



[something like that and we will](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h55m57s)



[implement it and in our constructor we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m00s)



[will go chill login dialog its new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m03s)



[delegate command and then I usually just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m07s)



[for for naming conventions I usually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m11s)



[name my my execution methods the command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m14s)



[name prefixed with the word on so that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m18s)



[just my own preference but that's the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m23s)



[way I like to do it so poof so we are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m25s)



[not going to pass a parameter so we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m30s)



[just gonna drop that guy right there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m31s)



[just by convention underscore typically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m34s)



[denotes an ignored value it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m37s)



[technically a valid identifier in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m42s)



[c-sharp there are some cases where this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m44s)



[actually does hint to the compiler](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m46s)



[please drop this out and ignore it but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m48s)



[in this case it's just going to be a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m52s)



[parameter with the name of underscore](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m53s)



[okay so let's see oh I can't do that can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h56m56s)



[I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m03s)



[material design themes WPF dialog host](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m03s)



[show](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m10s)



[alright ok so there's gonna be a couple](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m13s)



[things here so async void and then a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m17s)



[weight and then we're gonna do you log](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m21s)



[in view model well something like that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m26s)



[right so a couple things that are worth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m29s)



[noting here right right away with the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m32s)



[MVVM pattern so async void in c-sharp is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m35s)



[typically to be avoided almost always](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m38s)



[the exception to the rule is when you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m41s)



[have say an event handler like on a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m44s)



[button click you'll note over here this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m47s)



[guy is also async fried because this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m51s)



[effectively a top-level method top-level](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m53s)



[meaning we don't call this method](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m56s)



[ourselves the framework calls it for us](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h57m58s)



[when something occurs those methods are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m00s)



[allowed to be async void okay because if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m03s)



[you change them to be async tasks the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m07s)



[framework isn't looking for a method](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m09s)



[with that signature it's looking for a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m11s)



[method with void return so in this case](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m13s)



[we have to make it async void but it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m16s)



[aside from these top-level handlers do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m18s)



[not ever use it it will it will bite you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m22s)



[over and over and over and give you all](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m24s)



[kinds of confusing bugs to chase but I I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m26s)



[make the case that an execution method](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m31s)



[inside of a delegate is effectively a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m35s)



[top-level handler just like a button](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m38s)



[click because this is what gets invoked](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m40s)



[when our button is clicked so I would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m42s)



[like to make the case that this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m46s)



[acceptable and then you'll note the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m49s)



[other interesting difference here so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m52s)



[this show method takes an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m54s)



[object for its content your dialogue can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h58m57s)



[be any arbitrary content in the and this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m00s)



[handler here let's whack this guy it was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m05s)



[passing a user control and it was just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m09s)



[passing that in right there and I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m11s)



[gonna grab the identifier to you because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m14s)



[probably worth passing but it doesn't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m15s)



[have to be a user control if you give it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m19s)



[a UI element it's perfectly happy to say](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m20s)



[oh that's my content let me display that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m23s)



[for you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m25s)



[but in an MVVM pattern you don't want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m26s)



[your view models having to know anything](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m28s)



[about view objects you only want them](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m30s)



[knowing about other view models services](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m32s)



[dependencies etc right so in that case](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m35s)



[we're for our MVVM pattern we're just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m38s)



[going to use a login view model and this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m42s)



[guy has dialogue post identifier Oh](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m45s)



[interesting so I don't actually have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m50s)



[that so we're just going to private](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m52s)



[const let's go look up what this is so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=00h59m59s)



[you normally don't need to pass a an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m03s)



[identifier except in the case where you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m05s)



[have more than one dialog host so dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m09s)



[host in most of my apps I tend to have a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m13s)



[single dialog host instance and it lives](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m19s)



[at the the root and that's it but if you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m21s)



[start ending up with say multiple](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m25s)



[windows each of them have their own](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m27s)



[dialog host you're just calling a static](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m29s)



[method here so it needs to figure out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m31s)



[which instance or which dialog host you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m33s)



[want this displayed on because you can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m36s)



[imagine if you've got two windows and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m38s)



[they each have their own dialog host and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m39s)



[you call this method it needs to know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m41s)



[which one of those to go to so you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m43s)



[differentiate those by an ID so in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m45s)



[general we're passing the ID in this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m48s)



[case it's not strictly necessary because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m50s)



[this app only has one but if you were to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m52s)



[have more than one you would need to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m54s)



[pass this otherwise you will get an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m57s)



[exception okay so this gets us going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h00m58s)



[let's fire this up and look at what this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m02s)



[looks like real quick](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m03s)



[haha Mountain Dew oh how I love thee](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m09s)



[come on go go go go go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m17s)



[also happy news I have ordered an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m20s)



[updated computer that will be here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m24s)



[sometime next week](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m25s)



[so assuming I get time to actually set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m27s)



[it up and install everything I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m30s)



[have a much nicer machine for streaming](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m32s)



[next week so yours crossed hoping that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m33s)



[happens okay so we click our button and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m37s)



[because we didn't bind anything to our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m41s)



[command nothing's gonna work okay so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m44s)



[that's that's a whole lot of nada let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m45s)



[just go right here and we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m51s)



[inline this so window data context and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m52s)



[then we will do main window view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h01m58s)



[okay there's a lot of different ways of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m02s)



[basically of getting your view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m05s)



[assigned to the data context I do not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m07s)



[like that name more importantly why are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m13s)



[you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m16s)



[did that actually go to the right place](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m26s)



[oh I've got two main window view models](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m31s)



[oh well that's that's unfortunate let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m34s)



[get rid of that it's gonna say that the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m38s)



[name space looked very very wrong so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m42s)



[let's turn that off turn you off go back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m45s)



[try again](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m49s)



[that looks better okay that's what I was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m52s)



[confused out I was expected to see the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m55s)



[mvvm on the end of the namespace and it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m56s)



[was not there oh so there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h02m59s)



[different ways of getting your view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m02s)



[model into the data context this is by](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m03s)



[far the simplest you directly assign it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m07s)



[the next simplest I would argue is right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m09s)



[in the code behind in the constructor](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m12s)



[you set it right inside of this guy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m13s)



[those are the two most obvious ways of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m16s)



[doing it with that said there's other](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m18s)



[patterns and other ways of doing it view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m20s)



[model locator is a very popular pattern](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m22s)



[there's a lot of tricks with if you've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m24s)



[got dependency injection setup in your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m27s)



[app to go through and magically marry](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m29s)



[these things up other libraries like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m32s)



[prism or calibre and micro have other](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m36s)



[means of getting those too but basically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m39s)



[ultimately you want something in your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m42s)



[view that knows about what view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m45s)



[it's being hooked to right because it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m47s)



[okay if the view model if the view knows](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m50s)



[about the view model not the other way](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m51s)



[around the view model should be agnostic](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m53s)



[of its view okay so we're gonna set this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m55s)



[up and so these buttons can have a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h03m59s)



[command binding show login dialog now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m01s)



[let's start it now I think when we click](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m08s)



[this button it'll actually do something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m10s)



[I'm realizing I probably should have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m21s)



[named space this one little deeper](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m24s)



[well maybe not this is one of those](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m31s)



[areas where I'm always torn about do I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m34s)



[do that do I structure this the way that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m37s)



[I would want somebody to build their app](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m38s)



[or do i structure it in the simplest way](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m41s)



[to get my one point across](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m43s)



[okay so breakpoints hit from our command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m45s)



[we are now calling show dialog with a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m49s)



[log in view model edits were made what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m52s)



[edits no edits were made okay you are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h04m58s)



[you are frustrating me okay just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m06s)



[launched without debugging just go I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m10s)



[don't want to I don't want a debugger](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m13s)



[attached okay so you'll note that now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m15s)



[when we show our dialogue our dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m19s)



[pops up and it just shows us a single](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m21s)



[string okay this is one of the most](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m23s)



[common issues I would say that I see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m27s)



[people run into when they are doing mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m30s)



[is they're doing something they're going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m32s)



[along and then all of a sudden they just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m35s)



[get a type name displayed to them so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m37s)



[what's happening is we told the dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m40s)



[to show this view model and it happily](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m42s)



[took that view model shoved it right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m44s)



[into the the dialogue and then went I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m46s)



[don't I don't know how to display this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m49s)



[view model type name sounds great so it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m51s)



[basically just does the two string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m56s)



[method on the object and says is this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m57s)



[what you wanted it's like no that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h05m59s)



[that's not even close so we have to do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m01s)



[something to tell it how to display this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m04s)



[view model all right so there are a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m09s)



[couple ways of doing it and I think what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m12s)



[I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just start](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m14s)



[let's see view and I'm realized when I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m15s)



[probably should do is move all of my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m19s)



[view models down a level view model so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m22s)



[this is a little closer to how I would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m29s)



[structure it in a real app and usually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m33s)



[inside of these things there's inside of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m37s)



[both the view and the view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m41s)



[namespace there are additional](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m42s)



[namespaces that are usually segregated](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m44s)



[off to different areas of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m47s)



[application so you know if your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m49s)



[application has logical boundaries I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m51s)



[usually use those two to break these up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m53s)



[further so I end up with yet one more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h06m57s)



[layer of nesting typically there's not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m00s)



[an mvvm folder in my WPF projects but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m02s)



[there would be a view and a view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m05s)



[name space so what we are going to do is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m09s)



[we now need to create some views so step](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m12s)



[one we're gonna just go through and add](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m15s)



[a new resource dictionary and let's call](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m20s)



[it dialog templates right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m23s)



[okay so we've got dialogue templates so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m34s)



[the the way we handle this is to tell](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m37s)



[the the GUI how to display our view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m40s)



[models we create a data template and we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m42s)



[do data type and X type and we're going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m49s)



[to do say login you model all right what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h07m54s)



[I wanted data template and look up my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m02s)



[data type for me I'm gonna be happy and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m08s)



[do it for me not that happy where's my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m11s)



[intellisense Sharper would have done](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m17s)



[this for me already okay we'll just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m20s)



[we'll just grab it it's probably because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m23s)



[I've broken other stuff here let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m26s)



[here and I can fix this real quick](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m29s)



[that one thanks](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m33s)



[so back over here if we grab this we do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m37s)



[this and VM you model I'm gonna just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m42s)



[change this to VM because that's it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m49s)



[really is just a view model namespace so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m52s)



[then the data type on this becomes view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m54s)



[model login ok so then let's just do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h08m58s)



[some stuff so text block text hey this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m01s)



[is how you display it alright and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m06s)



[well let's let's get fancier stack panel](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m12s)



[boom and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m15s)



[button content some button right okay so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m21s)



[now the last thing we need to do so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m29s)



[we've told it how to display the view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m31s)



[model now the last thing we have to do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m32s)



[is go through and actually somehow](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m35s)



[connect this data template back to our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m37s)



[view model object so back here in my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m39s)



[main window view model or my my main](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m42s)



[window I'm just going to bring in that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m45s)



[resource dictionary so resource](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m47s)



[dictionary](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m52s)



[let's see an actually well no this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h09m56s)



[fine resource dictionary merge](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m00s)



[dictionaries to do and then we want it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m05s)



[pointed it mine so let's see that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m09s)



[becomes mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m12s)



[I am really not like you my intellisense](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m20s)



[being dead right now dialog templates](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m23s)



[dot sam'l](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m27s)



[and find it let's just compile because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m30s)



[I'm not I'm not actually convinced I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m33s)



[in a compiling state fact I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m35s)



[confident I'm broken so we basically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m38s)



[just need to get this data template](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m44s)



[referenced so that when it goes to look](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m46s)



[up the the data template for the view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m48s)



[model it finds it so this just needs to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m51s)



[be somewhere in the hierarchy when it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m55s)



[goes to look because when this dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h10m59s)



[host goes looking for that view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m00s)



[type it's gonna walk up its hierarchy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m02s)



[looking for things so it'll first look](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m04s)



[at the dialog host resources and say do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m06s)



[I find a data template no okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m08s)



[look at my parent which is the window](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m10s)



[does it Reece](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m12s)



[it have the resource ah yes I found it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m14s)



[in here okay you could also move these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m16s)



[things all the way up to the app zamel](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m19s)



[if you wanted them resolved at a global](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m21s)



[level but be cautious about how many](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m22s)



[things you put in your app zamel because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m25s)



[everything in your app dot zamel has to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m27s)



[be loaded for your app to start so if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m29s)



[you put everything in there your startup](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m32s)



[time is going to suffer so in general](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m35s)



[you want to try to keep things top level](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m38s)



[ish but usually that translates to at](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m40s)



[the root of a window at the root of a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m44s)



[user control you can technically put](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m46s)



[them lower down but usually for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m48s)



[simplicity it's it's done at the root of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m52s)



[the logical element which tends to be a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m57s)



[window or a user control in general](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h11m58s)



[and assuming this thing keeps going come](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m06s)



[on come on you can do it we'll see how](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m10s)



[this goes so hopefully if this works](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m14s)



[this will now get us actually displaying](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m17s)



[our dialogue and then we'll just tie it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m19s)



[in to basically the exact same control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m21s)



[that we used for the code behind that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m24s)



[way it boy what are you doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m27s)



[I was taking you so long that way that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m31s)



[way they end up displaying to say oh](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m32s)



[that's what I did oh dear heavens that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m34s)



[what's going on so I was debugging a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m37s)



[build a shoe earlier and turned my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m39s)



[msbuild output verbosity through the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m42s)



[roof don't do that it slows down your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m45s)



[builds useful for debugging bad for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m50s)



[performance so yeah](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m53s)



[when when not debugging your build you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h12m57s)



[should leave your output verbosity set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m00s)



[to like minimal probably not none but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m03s)



[detailed as you can see is a lot of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m07s)



[lines a lot of lines okay come on buddy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m11s)



[come on you can do it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m16s)



[oh I bet you it's real boy I bet you got](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m22s)



[confused and decided to recompile every](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m27s)



[project in the solution which there's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m29s)



[only there's only a couple projects in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m30s)



[this solution I think I'm up to like 60](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m32s)



[which is probably too many but whatever](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m36s)



[did you do do do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m43s)



[I also have been debating how much I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m47s)



[should start converting all these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m49s)



[projects over to dotnet core because I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m51s)



[do realize that if people are trying to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m55s)



[use these examples in older projects](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m57s)



[they might not have the dotnet core](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h13m59s)



[stuff installed making these as examples](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m00s)



[a little worse cetera et cetera so I've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m02s)



[sort of resolved myself to the idea of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m05s)



[could not copy oh all that effort](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m08s)



[because launch trust me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m12s)



[you can copy now so I've sort of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m17s)



[resolved myself to the idea that maybe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m20s)



[the new projects I create in here going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m23s)



[forward I might do as dotnet core and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m24s)



[leave all the old ones as framework that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m26s)



[way there's examples of framework for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m28s)



[people who want to see it maybe if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m31s)



[people have strong opinions I'm open to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m34s)



[hearing them okay so now we launch mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m35s)



[uh-uh and you'll note this is now our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m40s)



[data template that we defined which is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m44s)



[great so now now we have a way of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m47s)



[declaring a effectively the view for our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m49s)



[dialogue as part of these data templates](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m52s)



[so what I am going to do is I'm going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m54s)



[just blatantly copy both of these guys](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h14m57s)



[over because I basically want this exact](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m00s)



[same control right with only with only](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m03s)



[mild changes to it so this is going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m06s)



[become cm DBM view copy that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m09s)



[come over here change you and we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m17s)



[gonna do the same thing on the create so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m23s)



[that goes there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m25s)



[alright so rather than that would go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m29s)



[there okay great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m31s)



[perfect everyone's happy hope everyone's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m32s)



[happy let's see wait what are you what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m37s)



[are you unhappy about it's not found Oh](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m43s)



[probably because I'm still de bugging](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m47s)



[yeah that's probably a problem okay so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m49s)



[for our login control and let's just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m53s)



[just build this guy real quick to make](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m57s)



[sure it's not anything there we go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h15m59s)



[squiggly lines go away okay so mostly we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m02s)



[just want this template but we want to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m06s)



[change up the way this button works here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m07s)



[because this is using a click handler](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m10s)



[and MVVM we want to switch it so what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m14s)



[we're going to do is we are going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m17s)



[first start with our data templates so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m19s)



[rather than this is our template what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m22s)



[I'm going to do is I'm just going to map](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m24s)



[this to say the login control alright](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m25s)



[and it should at local poof so now the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m31s)



[the view for this view model when this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m36s)



[view model shows up it's going to just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m40s)



[map this into this control and it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m42s)



[going to set the data context for the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m44s)



[control to the view model for me just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m47s)



[great so now back over here okay so we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m49s)



[need to add over on our login view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m55s)



[so if we wanted we could do some some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h16m58s)



[bindable properties for like the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m02s)



[username and password so public string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m05s)



[username](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m08s)



[and this is gonna be backed actually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m11s)



[let's do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m14s)



[Get Set auto property it and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m17s)



[convert to full property great thank you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m24s)



[this guy will derive from our view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m28s)



[base and then we just changed this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m34s)



[property into something that raises](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m36s)



[inotify property changed this becomes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m40s)



[set ref boom boom okay if you have not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m43s)



[seen this pattern for doing the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m49s)



[properties what did I call it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m52s)



[it's not called set it's called set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m56s)



[property take a look at that blog post](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h17m57s)



[that I linked before again the the one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m01s)



[on getting started with mvvm kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m09s)



[walks through this pattern and setting](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m11s)



[up his view model base but you can sort](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m13s)



[of imagine doing something like this so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m15s)



[that means then on our login control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m18s)



[this text box the text here binding](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m21s)



[username alright so now that those will](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m27s)



[get linked up for me okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m32s)



[here we want to change up to be a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m35s)



[command and let's think about how we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m38s)



[gonna go about doing this do-do-do-do-do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m42s)



[do-do-do-do-do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m47s)



[because ultimately we want to change out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m49s)



[the content for the dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h18m51s)



[trying to decide the easiest way to go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m04s)



[about doing this movie](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m05s)



[well for starters let's just do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m08s)



[binding show create account so then on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m10s)



[our login view model we also need a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m19s)



[command I like to put them at the top](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m21s)



[public I command I already forgot what I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m23s)



[named it so create account great so set](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m27s)



[up a command over here and do this guy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m33s)



[here if you are studying a new project](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m38s)



[and you're using this as a template use](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m41s)



[this structure as a guide I would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m44s)



[probably tell you to pull an mvvm light](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m46s)



[for your view model and your command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m49s)



[implementation rather than using my very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m52s)



[simplistic commands so that for what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m54s)



[it's worth that would be my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m58s)



[recommendation not that they're they're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h19m59s)



[necessarily wrong but they're the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m03s)



[appropriate full implementation on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m05s)



[something like the command has a little](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m07s)



[bit more to it and will be a lot easier](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m09s)



[for you work with again conceptually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m12s)



[they work the same but there is some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m14s)



[nuance in the implementation so let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m16s)



[say show create account gets new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m20s)



[delegate command on show account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m24s)



[okay so generate via method please and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m35s)



[once again we're just going to throw](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m40s)



[away the parameter](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m41s)



[I'm trying to decide the best way to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m49s)



[have this guy get all the way back to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m51s)



[the dialogue host the so there's a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h20m56s)



[couple options here one is like a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m05s)



[publish/subscribe model or pub/sub is a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m08s)



[lot of people will call it where this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m10s)



[method just basically publishes a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m12s)



[message out and says hey I need my my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m15s)



[dialog content changed and then maybe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m19s)



[the main window or the main window view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m22s)



[model switches that out that would be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m24s)



[one option](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m30s)



[tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m34s)



[I'm wondering if maybe changing this guy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m38s)



[out might be cleaner so well this guy's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m43s)



[gonna be the one who gets ahold of it so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m49s)



[let's just just pass the let's just pass](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m51s)



[the dialogue session into this guy I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h21m58s)



[think that's probably the easiest way to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m01s)



[do it so on the the show method there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m03s)



[are overloads here around the around the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m08s)



[opening and closing event handlers let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m14s)



[see so closing event handler opening](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m17s)



[event handler this is the one I want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m19s)



[so don't remember don't remember the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m21s)



[exact signature of this so let's dive in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m27s)



[and look yep thanks go I want to say it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m30s)



[takes two parameters and I want to say](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m36s)



[it's something like sender and object so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m38s)



[this delegate is what I'm interested in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m42s)



[sender args got it great so in this case](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m45s)



[we're going to do sender args and we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m51s)



[just gonna lambda lambda body this guy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m56s)



[and be done with it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h22m59s)



[poof okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m01s)



[this guy's probably unhappy because he](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m05s)



[probably can't figure out which one it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m07s)



[won't which one we want so new dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m09s)



[opening event handler normally you don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m14s)



[have to declare the type explicitly and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m19s)



[it'll figure it out but in this case](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m21s)



[there is what do you what do you unhappy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m23s)



[about in this case there's two overloads](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m30s)



[of this show method one that takes the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m32s)



[opening and one that takes the closing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m35s)



[and I don't think it knows opened not](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m36s)



[opening](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m40s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m43s)



[based](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m48s)



[cheater mode boom using statement away](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m50s)



[we go okay so now it should be happy and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m53s)



[be able to figure this out but let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m55s)



[break the for our view model gets new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h23m56s)



[login view model and just pull you out](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m00s)



[into a local so we can reference you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m05s)



[view model and then you model dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m08s)



[session maybe it's a dot](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m18s)



[no naughty args it's important to use](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m24s)



[the right name and that guy will have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m28s)



[the session on them as well so let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m32s)



[just there's again there's a lot of ways](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m35s)



[to go about doing this the the short](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m39s)



[version is you either need to get a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m41s)



[whole you you need to get a hold of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m42s)



[dialogue session the the easiest ways to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m44s)



[do it are either with one of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m47s)



[callbacks from the show method or if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m49s)



[you've got something that has a direct](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m53s)



[reference to the dialogue host instance](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m56s)



[you can just pull it off the property on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h24m57s)



[there so either one but regardless you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m00s)



[need to get a hold of this dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m02s)



[session so lots of ways to skin a cat](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m04s)



[but we're gonna go with this so yes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m08s)



[you're fine I'm gonna take off the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m12s)



[internal set we're just gonna do get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m13s)



[sets and come up here and do this so on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m15s)



[this guy here when this command is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m21s)



[invoked we will do dialogue session and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m23s)



[it could be null](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m29s)



[like that is that is an option here so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m30s)



[update content new create a count view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m34s)



[model oh boom something kind of like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m40s)



[that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m44s)



[sure that'll work okay so the next thing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m48s)



[we need to do is back in our templates](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m51s)



[we need to give ourself a data template](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m53s)



[let's see data template data type let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h25m56s)



[see X type in the view model name space](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m00s)



[for my create account if you model I now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m05s)



[need C create account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m09s)



[count control something more like that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m19s)



[why are you unhappy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m27s)



[do you just unhappy because you haven't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m31s)



[been built yet you should be fine that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m35s)



[looks like the right namespace](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m39s)



[if you model namespace view namespace](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m42s)



[you can rename this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m46s)



[I'm afraid so we gotta wait for the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m51s)



[build to finish and then we can rename](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m53s)



[this build succeeded okay so you're just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m54s)



[slow okay so this gets us over to here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h26m56s)



[and let's just fire this up and make](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m00s)



[sure it works absolutely sketch this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m03s)



[part so it's worth noting a very obvious](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m06s)



[critique that I hear a lot is with mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m10s)



[is look how much extra code you had to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m13s)



[write because this is I have clearly had](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m15s)



[to setup a lot more code to do this then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m17s)



[in the code behind approach with that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m21s)



[said there are there are benefits to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m25s)



[this with the view model approach it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m27s)



[keeps a good separation of concerns from](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m29s)



[your view to your business logic so that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m31s)



[your view model doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m35s)



[concerned with like updating button](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m37s)



[States and changing visibility and that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m39s)



[kind of thing things just magically stay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m41s)



[in sync whereas or I should say with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m43s)



[mvvm things magically stay in sync](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m47s)



[because the bindings whereas in code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m49s)



[behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m51s)



[you're now in control of our thing and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m51s)



[that's up to you to do it it is also](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m53s)



[worth noting too if you're writing unit](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m56s)



[tests user controls and go behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h27m59s)



[methods are very very difficult to unit](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m02s)



[tests so usually you just abandon unit](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m05s)



[testing them all together whereas a view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m07s)



[model then keeps that logic because it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m10s)



[encapsulated and shouldn't know anything](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m12s)



[about view objects you can then go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m13s)



[through and just use them and unit test](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m16s)



[them like you would any other c-sharp](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m21s)



[class okay so we click](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m22s)



[the mvvm button and question what it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m26s)

[reference and not to set to the instance](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m38s)



[of an object that's not a good thing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m40s)



[why was where did you where did you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m45s)



[crash okay so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m51s)



[did I miss something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h28m57s)



[this the stack trace looks very very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m01s)



[suspect to me and I have a sinking](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m04s)



[suspicion it's more likely something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m11s)



[maybe here so the a lot of the controls](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m14s)



[have visual state managers with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m21s)



[storyboards that are effectively](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m23s)



[asynchronous code because they're doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m26s)



[animations and updating properties so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m27s)



[it's very possible that when you get](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m31s)



[crashes around those that it's the crash](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m34s)



[is more likely something went wrong](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m37s)



[during this process this just happened](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m39s)



[to be the result of it so there this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m42s)



[pulls the session sets it exits great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m47s)



[cannot animate is open property this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h29m56s)



[screams that there's just a straight-up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m02s)



[bug in the dialogue host](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m04s)



[but why does it work on the other side](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m17s)



[but not on the viewmodel side and more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m20s)



[importantly why did this break now I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m24s)



[sorry I'm a little confused](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m30s)



[let's relaunch this something something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m34s)



[seems very off with this where this was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m37s)



[working and then stopped working with no](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m42s)



[apparent reason](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m45s)



[just fire this up because we didn't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m53s)



[change anything about it what is going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m55s)



[on why are you unhappy why are you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h30m59s)



[unhappy to do fire the scam go go go go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m06s)



[go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m12s)



[okay so that makes me feel better so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m28s)



[it's not the callback it's more likely](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m30s)



[than our data template so undo undo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m32s)



[paste that means that if it's crashing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m37s)



[on launch probably you that it's unhappy](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m41s)



[about mvvm view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m46s)



[what are you is unable users because it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m49s)



[is not public or does not define a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m54s)



[public parameter constructor what I I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h31m56s)



[have a sinking suspicion this guy is my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m02s)



[it's the cause of my issues](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m04s)



[we are in the one that I think I'm in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m13s)



[this appears to match turn you off for a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m20s)



[moment just to make sure there's nothing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m26s)



[oh that's what it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m28s)



[haha found it okay when I copied these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m31s)



[guys over I forgot to update their code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m35s)



[behind and so that ere that it was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m39s)



[giving me where it said hey your control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m41s)



[doesn't define a parameter list](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m46s)



[constructor was pretty much spot on it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m48s)



[did not define a parameter list](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m51s)



[constructor because these guys were the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m52s)



[spitting image of the code behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m57s)



[implementation so we need to take these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h32m59s)



[guys back down and this is actually more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m03s)



[common of what you'll see in WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m06s)



[applications that are using mvvm and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m08s)



[that you won't have your code behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m10s)



[files will be all almost empty so let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m15s)



[see we're gonna turn the button click](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m20s)



[off of this guy for now now launch and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m21s)



[let's try this again so that was a very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m25s)



[confusing error or something that should](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m27s)



[have been simple](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m30s)



[I'm wondering if I'd paid closer](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m37s)



[attention if there was an inner](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m39s)



[exception that would have been a little](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m41s)



[more obvious what the problem was](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m42s)



[because the better exception would have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m46s)



[been could not instantiate you know log](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m48s)



[in control and huzzah we have a log in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m50s)



[control and we click this and huzzah we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h33m57s)



[have this and we haven't hooked this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m01s)



[button up yet](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m03s)



[okay well that and at least works so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m05s)



[that's good so let's go through and wire](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m12s)



[up this button now so create a count](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m16s)



[view model let's see so public I command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m19s)



[back command sure that sounds great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m27s)



[Auto code button](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m33s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m38s)



[new delicate command on back and this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m42s)



[here is basically going to be exactly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m49s)



[the same type of thing that we did on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m52s)



[our other view model only in Reverse so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h34m55s)



[we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m00s)



[that goes there so this away and and I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m05s)



[think what we're gonna do is we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m15s)



[change this up just a little bit and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m16s)



[we're gonna require this as a dialogue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m21s)



[session dialogue session](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m26s)



[Auto include great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m31s)



[let's see initialize my property for me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m35s)



[and add my null check I'd rather do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m37s)



[at the end rather than the beginning](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m42s)



[great so I don't need this anymore and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m45s)



[then you become a login view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h35m50s)



[so the other option because this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m05s)



[effectively going to create a new login](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m08s)



[view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m10s)



[we're just which is fine we're basically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m10s)



[throwing away our login view model when](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m13s)



[we go to the create account page and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m15s)



[then we'll create a new one when we want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m16s)



[to go back we could persist the instance](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m18s)



[and pass that in here rather than the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m21s)



[dialog session but okay so this guy is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m25s)



[going to pick up the this guy now needs](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m32s)



[a dialogue session pass to him which is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m36s)



[great and that should get us a little](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m39s)



[bit closer okay so fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m44s)



[and hopefully this MVVM pattern just now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m54s)



[all all works like it's supposed to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h36m58s)



[and then](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m05s)



[to do to do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m10s)



[so let's see so mvvm version comes up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m13s)



[and then create a new account back Hey](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m17s)



[go back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m27s)



[oh did I not bind I never set the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m30s)



[command that'll do it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m35s)



[so binding back command and I'm just](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m36s)



[gonna put some new lines there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m42s)



[poof now it works you will notice that I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m49s)



[have the magical sam'l edit and continue](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m52s)



[turned on which makes these types of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m55s)



[code changes much nicer I very much](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h37m58s)



[prefer to run my app make changes to my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m01s)



[zamel and see what those look like in my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m06s)



[running app I don't like the I don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m08s)



[like the sam'l designer because it's a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m10s)



[the designer is a best guess as to what](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m12s)



[your app might look like at run time I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m14s)



[would much rather see what my app does](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m16s)



[look like at run time and make my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m18s)



[changes they're so cool so that that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m20s)



[gives an mvvm version of it so let's go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m24s)



[just commit that real quick so lots of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m27s)



[changes great adding mvvm implementation](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m31s)



[great commit ok so the next one that we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m41s)



[wanted to do was something with a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m49s)



[transition so let's go up let's go up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m51s)



[here and I think what I'm gonna do is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h38m58s)



[I'm gonna create a new user control for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m04s)



[this just just for the purposes of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m06s)



[sanity user control please](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m09s)



[login with transitioned boom so inside](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m17s)



[of the material design exam a library](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m26s)



[there is a transition or control which](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m29s)



[basically lets you swap back and forth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m34s)



[between views which is sort of what we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m38s)



[want because right now we're just kind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m42s)



[of hard swapping the content in our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m43s)



[dialog whereas if we do something with a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m45s)



[nice transition you can get that kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m47s)



[wavy slide in slide out move forward](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m49s)



[move back type in implementation](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m52s)



[so transition er to do go resolve Thanks](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h39m55s)



[okay and then I think what we just do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m03s)



[here is I might need to do a separate](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m07s)



[namespace because I think I'm gonna want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m14s)



[to change out how this control works](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m16s)



[yeah let's do another namespace I I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m29s)



[think I think I should just separate](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m32s)



[these out and duplicate let's see well](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m34s)



[mmm mmm wondering if I do the mvvm one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m42s)



[first](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m46s)



[wondering if I do the mvvm one first so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m52s)



[let's go here where is the transitions I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m56s)



[don't know if this guy shows but by](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h40m59s)



[let's see transition area transition](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m03s)



[slide there's all this stuff in here but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m05s)



[it's not yeah because you can just embed](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m09s)



[the user control straight inside the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m14s)



[transition er and oh they'll handle it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m15s)



[for you which is wonderful it's exactly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m16s)



[what I want now let's just go in here so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m19s)



[let's do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m25s)



[class transition view model okay so slap](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m28s)



[that on there clean up my usings and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m40s)



[then add a new user control here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m42s)



[well I wish he's gonna be so close](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m51s)



[speak almost a duplication of everything](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h41m57s)



[trying to decide how much I reuse versus](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m03s)



[how much I transitioned let's do this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m06s)



[let's see so let's go here and we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m14s)



[basically are going to want to pick up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m18s)



[all of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m20s)



[copy/paste](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m24s)



[okay so we don't need either of you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m27s)



[anymore](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m32s)



[you're meaningless lets you create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m33s)



[account control and we need to change up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m37s)



[your namespace so you are no longer mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m40s)



[view and vision right](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m43s)



[crabs that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m52s)



[see you changes to transition the same](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m54s)



[on the login side again this this stuff](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h42m59s)



[is basically a copy and paste only](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m02s)



[because I'm trying to show four](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m05s)



[different concepts all in one app a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m07s)



[cleaner approach might be to to break](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m10s)



[out the mvvm and code behind examples](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m13s)



[into their own apps but then I end up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m17s)



[duplicating creation of projects in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m19s)



[Yatta Yatta Yatta Yatta](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m21s)



[and yak okay so we'll do that I do have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m22s)



[a transition view model so we're going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m28s)



[to go up here and we'll do a data](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m30s)



[template for it data template let's see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m32s)



[data type X type transition view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m37s)



[great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m44s)



[transitioner go find it for me please](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m49s)



[Thanks and then inside of here I'm going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m54s)



[to want the create account control and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h43m58s)



[this local should be pointed at not the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m03s)



[view namespace but the transition](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m06s)



[namespace so it's going to be worth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m09s)



[noting that these examples I suspect are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m11s)



[going to confuse some people and maybe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m14s)



[we should rename local to make this more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m16s)



[obvious transition let's see so create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m18s)



[account control and login control and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m23s)



[the transition er requires you to tell](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m30s)



[it it's index which I think we should](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m33s)



[probably fix at some point but I believe](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m37s)



[that's still an issue in the latest](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m39s)



[version okay so we've got that guy we've](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m40s)



[got that guy doo doo doo doo doo doo doo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m43s)



[so let's get let's get through all of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m46s)



[that really quick and doo doo doo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m49s)



[so that gets me into their that gets me](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h44m58s)



[into their and main window let's go back](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m00s)



[here or I'm sorry main window view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m05s)



[so that's here here here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m08s)



[so rather than show login dialog public](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m13s)



[I command show transition login dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m17s)



[transition log and diet log](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m30s)



[on show transition login dialog and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m35s)



[again the the objective here is we want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m41s)



[to basically have the same UI that we do](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m44s)



[before that we had before but rather](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m48s)



[than just hard swapping the dialogues](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m51s)



[content we want that nice swipe forward](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m53s)



[swipe back effect as the user goes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m55s)



[between the login screen and the create](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m58s)



[accountant screen so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h45m59s)



[very similar to this except for we don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m03s)



[need this dialogue session anymore so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m09s)



[that's going away and we aren't going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m13s)



[do login view model we're gonna do a new](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m18s)



[transition view model so part of doing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m23s)



[the the change here and switch into a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m28s)



[different view model is simply so that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m32s)



[we've got a different type to key on for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m34s)



[the data template so this guy here is a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m36s)



[different dialogue template so we need](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m39s)



[to include that just like we did this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m42s)



[here so rather than view we're gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m46s)



[grab the one in transition as well and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m50s)



[that should get me that template](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m55s)



[okay so now the last thing we need here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h46m59s)



[is this guy so I believe if I remember](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m02s)



[correctly transitioner I thought see to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m08s)



[do I thought yeah so it's got moved next](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m16s)



[move previous commands which is exactly](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m18s)



[what we want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m21s)



[so on the login control this command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m22s)



[changes to transition ER move next](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m28s)



[command](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m36s)



[I'll see MD](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m41s)



[well so that becomes that so in WPF this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m45s)



[the terminology for this is called a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m51s)



[routed command this basically so unlike](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m52s)



[a normal command like what we did before](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m57s)



[where it pulls the command off of our](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h47m58s)



[view model a routed command goes looking](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m01s)



[through the visual hierarchy so in this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m04s)



[case it's gonna look for somebody who's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m07s)



[going to handle these transition or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m09s)



[commands so because these user controls](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m11s)



[are stored inside of the transition err](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m14s)



[when it walks up the view hierarchy and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m16s)



[gets to the transition or control the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m19s)



[transition or control will go oh I know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m21s)



[how to handle that command let me go and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m23s)



[do the right thing for you so it's a way](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m24s)



[of letting your child control be pretty](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m26s)



[agnostic about the implementation of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m29s)



[command and just say what it wants to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m31s)



[happen and then trust that somebody else](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m33s)



[will will handle it and do it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m36s)



[move previous command so something more](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m39s)



[akin to this you'll notice that this is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m44s)



[also the way these close commands are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m45s)



[working on these like create and cancel](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m48s)



[buttons is these buttons are just saying](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m50s)



[fire the closed dialog command and I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m53s)



[gonna trust that somewhere higher up in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m55s)



[the view that I'm inside of a dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h48m58s)



[somewhere and somebody's gonna actually](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m01s)



[handle this command which because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m02s)



[they're in a dialogue eventually gets up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m04s)



[to the dialog host which does in fact](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m06s)



[handle this command you could put your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m08s)



[own handlers on these at a different](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m09s)



[level and do something different if you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m11s)



[wanted or if you're just inside of the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m13s)



[write control inside of this library](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m15s)



[just works so I think I think that now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m16s)



[works](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m22s)



[and maybe I will ditch the code-behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m28s)



[example not sure if it's worth doing a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m31s)



[code-behind example for this transition](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m37s)



[or stuff only because the the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m39s)



[code-behind example for this is gonna](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m41s)



[look almost identical to them vvm mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m43s)



[one because there's so little data](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m48s)



[binding here though there it is worth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m50s)



[noting that there's a small issue we](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m53s)



[need to address with the the wrong view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m55s)



[model being assigned in each case so but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h49m58s)



[this should be enough to show the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m01s)



[animations hopefully this thing keeps up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m03s)



[with the animations so that we can see](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m07s)



[them](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m08s)



[go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m12s)



[go did I not bind the button on my main](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m14s)



[window I did not will be a problem](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m16s)



[binding show transition login dialog](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m23s)



[just try that again there we go so now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m26s)



[if I click here switches there and you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m33s)



[kind of saw that bubble out animation](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m36s)



[switch back and it shows that animation](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m40s)



[so the transition er has other](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m43s)



[animations that you can go through and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m44s)



[apply to it this just happens to be the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m46s)



[defaults so sure so if you want kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m48s)



[that effect that's how you do it so the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m53s)



[bug that I mentioned so right now the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m57s)



[problem is both of these controls are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h50m59s)



[getting the wrong view model applied to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m01s)



[them so both of these are getting the so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m04s)



[the login control and the create account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m07s)



[control both have their their view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m09s)



[set to this transition for you model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m12s)



[which is not quite right but these are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m14s)



[in a separate namespace which means you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m22s)



[could probably tie them to a different](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m23s)



[view model so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m25s)



[let's see to do stuff to support the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m30s)



[login control and create account control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m41s)



[in the transition namespace so there's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m47s)



[there's really nothing that needs to be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m55s)



[done in the view model to get this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m56s)



[behavior however what you might want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h51m58s)



[again I don't know this for a fact but](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m01s)



[say you well here let's just do it real](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m04s)



[quick I'm gonna put more stuff but I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m07s)



[do a quick example](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m13s)



[so public string username alright](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m14s)



[get set and then we'll do this and full](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m19s)



[property please great great great great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m24s)



[and this needs to drive from view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m29s)



[base to do and then this becomes said](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m33s)



[property ref value okay alright so now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m40s)



[we have a user name property that we can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m46s)



[bind to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m48s)



[let's go here let's go here so this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m48s)



[one's being bound to a username let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m54s)



[see textbox](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h52m58s)



[text](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m02s)



[by Dean](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m04s)



[user name okay so what has this gotten](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m07s)



[us so because both of both the login](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m11s)



[control and the create account control](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m15s)



[are now sharing the same view model](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m17s)



[object which means when one of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m19s)



[textboxes updates the user name property](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m21s)



[in the view model the other textbox is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m25s)



[going to update automatically for us so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m27s)



[in the situation where somebody may go](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m30s)



[to sign in and then say perhaps you want](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m33s)



[to keep that user name pre-populated for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m35s)



[them so they don't have to type it again](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m39s)



[some user name alright so I click over](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m41s)



[to here some user name gets](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m45s)



[pre-populated in here because both of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m47s)



[these are pointing to the same view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m49s)



[model which means the same property is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m51s)



[back in the text field for both of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m54s)



[text boxes so this is where the MVVM](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m56s)



[pattern really really starts to shine](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h53m58s)



[when you can start to have this kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m00s)



[complex logic that would be really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m02s)



[obnoxious to implement in the code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m04s)



[behind where you have to watch for text](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m06s)



[changed and okay when this one changes I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m08s)



[update this one and back and forth and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m10s)



[you have to deal with that with bindings](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m12s)



[it all just works and you're done so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m14s)



[this is one of those areas where I think](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m16s)



[makes the case really well for an MVVM](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m19s)



[pattern and why you might select it so I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m22s)



[think that is probably clear enough and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m25s)



[I think on this main window one I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m29s)



[gonna just comment this out for now and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m34s)



[leave a comment here let me know](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m36s)



[wants to see the implementation for this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m45s)



[one okay because again I I think let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m51s)



[see very similar to the mvvm because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h54m59s)



[again even though this one's using mvvm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m04s)



[there's the the stuff in this transition](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m06s)



[namespace almost doesn't need a view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m09s)



[model at all](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m12s)



[it basically functions on its own](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m13s)



[because of the routed commands and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m15s)



[there's not all there's not a lot here I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m19s)



[mean there there is technically this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m21s)



[view model with this property that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m22s)



[being used but there there's not that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m24s)



[much else that's in here one kind of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m27s)



[side note I did use a password box](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m31s)



[inside of this UI this guy is really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m35s)



[obnoxious to bind to in fact it is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m37s)



[actively made difficult to do data](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m41s)



[binding with because the problem with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m43s)



[binding to a string property is it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m45s)



[very easy for tools to just go and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m48s)



[inspect that and read the value of that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m50s)



[string whereas a password is something](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m52s)



[that is probably needs to be more secure](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m54s)



[so the password box locks down your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h55m57s)



[password into a secure string not a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m01s)



[normal string which means data binding](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m04s)



[to it doesn't work and you have to use](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m06s)



[code behind techniques to go and read it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m08s)



[out and that kind of thing so it's a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m10s)



[little obnoxious there's lots of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m11s)



[information online about how to work](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m14s)



[around this problem in various ways some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m17s)



[people just ditch using the password box](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m20s)



[and say I don't care if something can](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m22s)



[read the memory of my process I have a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m24s)



[different problem okay that like that's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m26s)



[a solution you you have to evaluate your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m29s)



[app to make that determination some](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m30s)



[people go through and do like attach](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m33s)



[properties on the password box that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m35s)



[basically convert between the secured](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m37s)



[screen string and a normal string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m39s)



[effectively mitigating the protection](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m42s)



[that the secure string gives you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m45s)



[sometimes they do it kind of late bound](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m47s)



[so that the attack surface is smaller](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m49s)



[but yeah so worth knowing about that is](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m53s)



[the password box doesn't really play](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m56s)



[that nice in an mvvm environment because](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h56m59s)



[of security and you need to handle that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m02s)



[so let's go through I think we're going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m05s)



[to let's push push this stuff up go here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m08s)



[so let's see these all changes added](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m14s)



[mvvm transition example let's see also](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m21s)



[shows sharing data which is again it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m29s)



[sort of cheating to share data it's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m37s)



[worth I guess one other comment I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m40s)



[make here so if in the event that you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m42s)



[wanted to do that sort of same pass the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m44s)



[username back and forth in one of these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m47s)



[other examples so like for example if in](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m50s)



[the basic MVVM pattern we wanted to pass](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m54s)



[this username over to here you you have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h57m57s)



[access to it so maybe a minute let's I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m01s)



[on a roll let's just keep going](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m04s)



[ah let's see public string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m05s)



[a lowercase n I think I lowercased it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m12s)



[before I got to get my templates](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m14s)



[installed again so that I don't have to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m16s)



[keep typing these I've got code snippets](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m18s)



[that I've written to generate these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m20s)



[properties so I don't have to keep](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m22s)



[typing them all the time this is really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m24s)



[obnoxious let's see I normally I agree](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m26s)



[with grouping like members but for the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m32s)



[purposes of bindable properties I really](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m35s)



[like having the field right next to the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m41s)



[property that it goes with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m45s)



[okay so there's that guy there oh so you](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m50s)



[need to derive from view model base okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m54s)



[so these views each have a separate one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h58m58s)



[let's see here so we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m01s)



[and because these are separate view](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m04s)



[models these guys need to tell each](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m07s)



[other about them so user name gets user](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m09s)



[name and then same thing on the other](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m14s)



[side this guy here we do something like](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m17s)



[this something like this we do use your](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m22s)



[name gets user name and that goes](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m27s)



[through and proof is in the pudding I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m30s)



[just fire this up but now on the basic](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m35s)



[mvvm example if I type in a username and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m36s)



[then switch to the other view it'll pass](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m39s)



[it through to the other view model oh](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m41s)



[did I update and check I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m43s)



[updated the view on the create accounts](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m47s)



[ID to use that property](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m49s)



[let's look oh yeah see not updated let's](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m50s)



[make sure this one is this one's updated](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m55s)



[hey you're my way hold that thought hold](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=01h59m58s)



[on hold on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m03s)



[come here you magical update okay so if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m06s)



[we go in here and fire this guy up and I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m12s)



[go no foo toggle over foo is now](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m15s)



[populated in here as well bar back foo](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m20s)



[bar is populated here so you've got a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m26s)



[way of now passing data back and forth](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m28s)



[between these things so let's go and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m30s)



[while we're doing it let's look at the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m36s)



[code behind example and do that as well](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m38s)



[so we'll handle this one here so login](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m42s)



[with transition](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m48s)



[we're gonna delete this because this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m49s)



[doesn't that doesn't serve a purpose](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m51s)



[anymore these guys though do serve a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m52s)



[purpose so let's see string username I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h00m56s)



[gonna do the same on this side](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m03s)



[straining username and this basically](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m07s)



[follows the exact same pattern as the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m11s)



[viewmodel ones except for now we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m14s)



[going to be in charge of doing it so](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m19s)



[let's see that looks funny but we're](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m21s)



[going with it we're going with it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m27s)



[give me I'm just saying giving the X](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m32s)



[name of username and having it literally](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m34s)



[line up with the text blocks text of](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m37s)



[username I see a potential confusion](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m39s)



[point there so we will grab the username](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m42s)



[text box and grab its text property poof](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m46s)



[and pass it through and then same on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m50s)



[this side so username text property and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h01m53s)



[let that go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m01s)



[okay so now we should have the same](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m03s)



[behavior on the code-behind side where](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m05s)



[Oh except for when you don't you don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m08s)



[do anything with it so the username text](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m13s)



[its username again this is one of those](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m18s)



[areas where if you're doing code behind](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m21s)



[you're in charge of doing all the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m23s)



[updates which means you can mess it up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m25s)



[whereas the binding just works as long](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m29s)



[as you set it in the property you don't](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m34s)



[have to think about anything else okay](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m36s)



[and there is no argument sort of a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m43s)



[little bit uh oh this guy wants an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m45s)



[initial user name great empty string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m49s)



[sounds wonderful](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m53s)



[and we go the other option here would be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h02m57s)



[to give this login control an overloaded](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m00s)



[constructor that doesn't take in the](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m03s)



[string or even MIT just make the string](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m05s)



[an optional parameter either one would](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m08s)



[be acceptable and probably the approach](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m10s)



[I would go with in a more production yep](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m13s)



[okay so same test foo create account](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m18s)



[switches over Foos populated we change](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m22s)



[it to bar hit back food bars now set up](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m25s)



[there okay great](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m28s)



[so back to get crackin](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m31s)



[one more commit let's see here](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m35s)



[adding passing data between the views on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m39s)



[stage all commit and we'll just push](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m48s)



[that up okay so hopefully hopefully that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m52s)



[was helpful](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m56s)



[again I sometimes I get off on these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h03m57s)



[small examples but these are are always](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m00s)



[based upon questions that I've either](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m04s)



[gotten in the Gator chat or issues that](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m06s)



[I've seen come up so hopefully again if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m08s)



[if people find this helpful I'm very](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m11s)



[happy to go through and do up these](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m13s)



[examples and even work through them on](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m15s)



[on the stream for people who have](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m17s)



[questions who may want to interact I'll](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m20s)



[also throw an option out there for](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m23s)



[people as well if you have an](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m26s)



[open-source project and you are wanting](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m28s)



[some help or pair programming our code](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m33s)



[review on it let me know I would be I](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m35s)



[would be happy to do that especially if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m37s)



[somebody is interested in maybe doing a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m40s)



[pair programming session on an app](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m42s)



[you're working on as part of this stream](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m44s)



[shoot me a message on the Gator chatroom](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m47s)



[and we can see about scheduling that and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m49s)



[going through and doing it because I'm](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m52s)



[I'm happy to do it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m53s)



[my only rules would be is let's make](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m55s)



[sure this is something that's open](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h04m59s)



[source and okay to to share so make sure](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m00s)



[that you actually own the intellectual](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m03s)



[property and and other than that I think](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m05s)



[be happy to go through and do it it](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m10s)



[doesn't necessarily have to be WPF](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m12s)



[though that's definitely where my](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m15s)



[expertise tends to lie so that would be](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m17s)



[helpful so that options out there if](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m20s)



[anybody wants a code review or pairing](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m22s)



[and if you want to do it as part of this](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m24s)



[stream let me know in the comments or or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m26s)



[message me on the Gator chatroom and](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m30s)



[like I said happy to try and schedule](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m31s)



[something and see if it works so with](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m34s)



[that it is a about at that two hour mark](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m36s)



[for me so I think I am probably going to](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m39s)



[call it here for tonight since this is a](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m41s)



[nice wrap-up point and then we will](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m42s)



[we'll do this again next week if there](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m47s)



[are topics from ignite or other](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m50s)



[technology stacks that people are](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m52s)



[interested in learning more about or](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m53s)



[just kind of having a group learning](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m55s)



[session struggle through it together one](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h05m58s)



[night let me know what you're interested](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h06m01s)



[in seeing and I'm happy to to go through](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h06m03s)



[and do those so that I'm going to say](https://youtu.be/JHZIoTfo_10?t=02h06m05s)
