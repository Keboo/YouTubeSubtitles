[there we are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m03s)

[okay welcome back everyone uh tonight](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m04s)

[i'm gonna do something a little bit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m07s)

[different than what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m08s)

[uh i normally do uh i've been focusing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m09s)

[on the material design in xaml library](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m12s)

[recently](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m14s)

[um and tonight i've uh decided i wanted](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m15s)

[to give a pass at win ui three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m18s)

[uh so for those people who are maybe a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m21s)

[little unfamiliar with what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m23s)

[win ui three is uh just want to back up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m24s)

[and kind of give a little bit of uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m27s)

[history and evolution of kind of how we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m29s)

[got all the way this far](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m31s)

[so way back in the olden days there was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m33s)

[wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m36s)

[right or i guess even before that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m36s)

[windows forms um which then wpf came](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m38s)

[along](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m41s)

[the thought was so this great new thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m41s)

[is going to obsolete win forms well that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m43s)

[that is just not true](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m45s)

[winforms is still very much alive and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m46s)

[very popular](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m48s)

[um and i believe more popular than wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m53s)

[but wpf came along and introduced this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m54s)

[idea of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m56s)

[xaml this xml based way of laying out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m57s)

[your ui which was great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h00m59s)

[uh it solved a lot of kind of the weird](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m01s)

[issues that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m03s)

[uh winforms had where you either had to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m04s)

[do it in the wysiwyg designer or c-sharp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m07s)

[and you tweak stuff around and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m09s)

[things didn't always kind of lay out the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m11s)

[way that you would want one of my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m13s)

[biggest pet peeves is in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m14s)

[winforms things don't automatically fill](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m16s)

[their containing space you actually have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m18s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m20s)

[do work to make that happen whereas in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m20s)

[wpf that's kind of the default in most](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m22s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m24s)

[um and then after wpf uh kind of around](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m26s)

[when windows 8 was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m29s)

[launching there was this idea of what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m32s)

[was called metro apps or using the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m34s)

[windows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m36s)

[runtime or winrt as a lot of people](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m37s)

[called it the idea with these apps was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m40s)

[that they were sandboxed easily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m43s)

[controllable and unlike wpf they](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m44s)

[couldn't just run ramp it on a user](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m46s)

[system](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m48s)

[right there was there was a limit to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m48s)

[what they could do but they got a lot of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m51s)

[nice features toast notifications auto](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m52s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m55s)

[all this kind of stuff that was backed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m56s)

[by this new kind of windows store](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m57s)

[ecosystem that was coming in windows 8.](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h01m59s)

[this is eventually what became the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m01s)

[universal windows platform or uwp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m04s)

[uh and then moving beyond that there was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m07s)

[something called win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m09s)

[two and this is where a lot of kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m10s)

[the confusion between](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m12s)

[uh when ui comes because win ui two was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m13s)

[more](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m16s)

[uh a control library and a nice update](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m17s)

[to that that uwp infrastructure because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m21s)

[the the winrt libraries expanded to give](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m24s)

[the apps](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m26s)

[more control more access to different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m26s)

[device uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m28s)

[sensors and and that kind of thing to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m30s)

[able to expand on them](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m32s)

[the they were uh put out to where they](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m34s)

[could run on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m36s)

[xbox at the time windows phone uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m37s)

[rip um and it was great it was wonderful](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m40s)

[uh but then this win ui 3 is coming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m44s)

[along and it's very different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m46s)

[now it shares the name with win ui 2](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m48s)

[with the little number increase but it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m50s)

[not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m52s)

[it's not just win ui 2 v next right when](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m53s)

[ui 2 was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m56s)

[sort of this bump with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h02m57s)

[the uwp and win ui 3 sort of aims to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m01s)

[break](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m05s)

[that and move forward so let me jump](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m05s)

[forward and i'll show you what i mean](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m08s)

[so there's this wonderful website](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m10s)

[because apparently i wasn't the only one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m13s)

[who was confusing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m15s)

[with a bunch of major differences](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m17s)

[between win ui 2 versus win ui 3.](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m19s)

[um and once again this is uh win ui 3 is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m22s)

[poised as this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m26s)

[latest latest evolution if you're going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m27s)

[to be building desktop apps right this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m29s)

[is where](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m31s)

[where the the new stuff should probably](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m32s)

[be built](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m35s)

[right um obviously wpf isn't going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m35s)

[away anytime soon right one of the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m39s)

[biggest](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m41s)

[wpf out wpf apps out there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m42s)

[is visual studio right there there's no](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m45s)

[way we are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m47s)

[seeing a major revamp of this anytime](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m48s)

[soon it's still very much committed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m50s)

[microsoft has brought both windows forms](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m52s)

[and wpf all the way forward to the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m54s)

[latest.net 5](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m56s)

[there is no sun setting at least](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h03m57s)

[not on the immediate horizon right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m00s)

[however this does offer a lot of very](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m04s)

[nice features](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m06s)

[and so given that the material design in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m07s)

[xaml project doesn't necessarily have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m10s)

[wpf in the name](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m12s)

[at one point in time there was kind of a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m13s)

[side effort to kind of poke it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m15s)

[well what would happen if we expanded](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m17s)

[this out into](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m19s)

[uh uwp right and there was a little bit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m20s)

[that that happened there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m23s)

[not a lot right a few buttons and that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m24s)

[kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m26s)

[i wanted to take another rev and look at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m27s)

[win ui 3 and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m29s)

[see what it would take to get some basic](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m30s)

[level of support](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m33s)

[right there's a lot of controls that are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m34s)

[built into here that don't exist in wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m36s)

[right there's some potential experiences](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m39s)

[and theming issues that could be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m41s)

[interesting and fun to try out so that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m43s)

[is where we're going to go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m45s)

[uh the other thing i'm going to point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m47s)

[out is there is sort of this weird](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m48s)

[i don't want to say](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m51s)

[contention uh between microsoft's fluent](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m55s)

[design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m58s)

[and material design right some people](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h04m59s)

[are very much](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m01s)

[uh on the side of the fence that no this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m02s)

[is a windows app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m04s)

[fluent design is the the windows layout](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m05s)

[it should look like a windows app yada](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m07s)

[yada yada](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m09s)

[right um i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m10s)

[don't necessarily subscribe to that all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m13s)

[the way right i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m14s)

[apps should look great the users should](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m16s)

[be able to be effective in them](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m18s)

[and i think in my opinion you should use](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m21s)

[what makes sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m24s)

[right so if fluent design is what makes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m24s)

[sense for your app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m27s)

[great if you've got maybe an android app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m28s)

[and you're looking to bring it over to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m31s)

[the desktop and you're wanting users to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m32s)

[feel a little more at home](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m34s)

[great right like use what use what makes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m36s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m38s)

[use what makes you happy so we are going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m39s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m42s)

[run through this now there's a bit on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m42s)

[this getting started guide for project](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m44s)

[reunion](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m45s)

[now i was hoping to actually have gone](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m46s)

[all the way through the whole](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m48s)

[file new project bit my chat bubbles are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m50s)

[cutting off](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h05m52s)

[um there is a little bit of setup that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h06m24s)

[needs to happen](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h06m27s)

[studio which i literally just finished](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h06m40s)

[excellent we are going to fire the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m04s)

[let's just fire visual studio up and go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m08s)

[the other thing to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m10s)

[to note um and this is rather important](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m11s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m14s)

[visual studio 2019 1610](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m14s)

[so if you are not running preview](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m19s)

[versions of visual studio you will need](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m21s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m23s)

[if you want to actually um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m23s)

[get access to this so just be aware that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m27s)

[is a requirement or at least a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m30s)

[documented requirement so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m33s)

[let's start here file new project right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m36s)

[that seems like a very good place to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m39s)

[start uh let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m41s)

[when ui go find me something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m43s)

[come on i see the bar chugging](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m47s)

[search the things this is not supposed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m51s)

[to be a hard operation](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m55s)

[come on there we go okay so we got a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m57s)

[blank app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h07m59s)

[in uwp and i think what we actually want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m00s)

[i'm most interested in doing the desktop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m04s)

[based ones right so there's there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m07s)

[basically the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m11s)

[sandboxed variant non-sandbox variant](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m12s)

[and i think i want to go with the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m16s)

[non-sandbox](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m17s)

[so blank app packaged when ui 3 and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m18s)

[desktop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m21s)

[oh here let's just save myself a little](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m23s)

[trouble i do c sharp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m26s)

[okay we'll just drop the other one so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m28s)

[we've got blank app package](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m29s)

[no package we got a class library in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m31s)

[desktop and then we got some uwp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m34s)

[variants](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m36s)

[component and variant and then other](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m37s)

[stuff uh let's go with packaged](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m39s)

[uh because getting a nice little msix at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m41s)

[the end of the day](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m44s)

[sounds rather nice uh okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m46s)

[and let's call this uh win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m50s)

[about material design and xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h08m55s)

[mdix not to be confused with msix](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m00s)

[uh sure create me a project](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m04s)

[um oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m08s)

[so what apis do i want access to i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m11s)

[know if i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m14s)

[care yeah oldest](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m14s)

[seems fine right we're i'm most](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m17s)

[interested in looking at theming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m20s)

[and stuff so i don't yeah i'm not i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m21s)

[not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m25s)

[interested in what windows apis i can't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m25s)

[imagine there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m27s)

[too much different in the way of theming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m28s)

[goes why are you opening on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m30s)

[that monitor back over here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m32s)

[okay so what do we got here so we got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m36s)

[what looks like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m38s)

[an msix installer package great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m39s)

[uh we got what looks like an app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m42s)

[we got something with packages which i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m46s)

[assume it's going to restore here in a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m48s)

[minute once this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m50s)

[blue bar at the bottom finishes its its](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m52s)

[whole doohickey](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m55s)

[the the background thing okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m56s)

[restored all the packages great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h09m58s)

[uh i don't know do i need to start](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m01s)

[oh interesting so the mdix package is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m06s)

[still on the old](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m08s)

[ms build](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m10s)

[wonder why that's the case that's yucky](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m14s)

[i don't i don't like old old sdk4 i like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m18s)

[pretty sdk format see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m20s)

[pretty we like pretty um okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m26s)

[i'm trying to decide if this is the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m29s)

[startup project](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m32s)

[for reasons or if i can just i so before](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m33s)

[mucking with the msix i just kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m36s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m39s)

[start the app right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m40s)

[in theory i should be able to file a new](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m43s)

[project in f5](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m45s)

[let's just keep it simple at first can i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m48s)

[launch the app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m51s)

[answer no uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m53s)

[class not registered so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h10m57s)

[let's assume for a moment then that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m00s)

[this needs to be the startup project](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m04s)

[is there some sort of installationy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m10s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m12s)

[that needs to happen for this to work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m13s)

[again](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m16s)

[so i'm learning this along with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m16s)

[everybody else so just to be clear](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m18s)

[i don't have any special knowledge here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m20s)

[uh okay so that makes sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m23s)

[click me okay and it's clicked](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m27s)

[and that's the sum total of it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m32s)

[it's weird it almost looks like there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m35s)

[some](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m38s)

[weird artifacting of that when the mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m38s)

[is over like it's losing clear type or](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m41s)

[something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m43s)

[i don't know if that's big enough for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m44s)

[people to see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m46s)

[um if i put zoom it on i betcha](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m48s)

[bet you we can catch it right so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m51s)

[yeah see no see if we look at that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h11m56s)

[see how the font is just oh that's big](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m00s)

[uh how the font is just gray and white](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m04s)

[there whereas if we wait](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m06s)

[and then look at it non-clicked mode](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m08s)

[i guess it's the same thing i wonder if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m12s)

[it just looks weird because it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m13s)

[enlarged](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m15s)

[interesting okay so there's an app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m17s)

[that's a thing let's look at the xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m21s)

[so we got a stack panel kind of looks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m25s)

[like what we would expect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m29s)

[it's got a button it's got a click](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m31s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m33s)

[kinda looks like how we would expect uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m34s)

[let me make that bigger for people](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m36s)

[okay so let's look at the code behind we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m39s)

[click handler it sets the content and it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m43s)

[just works](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m46s)

[okay this seems easy enough](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m49s)

[okay so let's let's play with this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m53s)

[button then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m56s)

[right so theoretically what i would like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m57s)

[to do is i would like to see what it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h12m59s)

[takes to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m02s)

[some sort of material design theming for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m03s)

[this right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m06s)

[so let's do this let's go out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m07s)

[to github to everyone's favorite](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m10s)

[material design and xaml project](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m14s)

[right i'm sure it's everyone's favorite](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m16s)

[link in the chat for people man that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m19s)

[that's gonna bother me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m22s)

[that that that no bueno that no bueno](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m24s)

[um sorry one second i'm gonna see if i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m29s)

[can adjust that because that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m31s)

[that is going to really really really](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m35s)

[bother me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m37s)

[and i think i can toggle that real quick](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m39s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m42s)

[come on take me take me in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m48s)

[load low download okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m52s)

[i want chat box uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m56s)

[i want to come down here i want to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h13m59s)

[something like that save](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m03s)

[let's turn off](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m09s)

[i'm going to assume something about my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m13s)

[custom css](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m15s)

[has broken it and then we are going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m16s)

[go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m19s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m21s)

[me it's not where i want it but at least](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m24s)

[it's readable we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m27s)

[we're gonna go with it for now we'll not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m30s)

[just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m32s)

[just shift that guy up just a little bit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m34s)

[that way my head isn't blocking it and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m39s)

[something to something about like that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m42s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m44s)

[at least now we're readable okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m46s)

[let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m48s)

[and just pick on one of the button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m49s)

[themes right so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m51s)

[we've got a button let's go make](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m53s)

[ourselves a button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m56s)

[i think the easiest one to probably port](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h14m58s)

[over is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m00s)

[this style here and i'm there's probably](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m02s)

[going to be a decent amount of work to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m05s)

[go along with this but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m06s)

[we're just going to do it all kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m08s)

[right right in line here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m09s)

[and maybe as part of this we're going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m11s)

[have a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m13s)

[adventure in theming out and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m15s)

[doing control templates okay so let's do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m23s)

[i assume i can add some sort of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m24s)

[resourcey dictionary](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m25s)

[a new item sure sounds great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m28s)

[and do you have some sort of resource](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m31s)

[dictionary i've done enough stuff in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m34s)

[uwp to be dangerous so that sounds great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m38s)

[so how about material design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m41s)

[what do we call this thing over here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m46s)

[material design buttons something or](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m47s)

[something something something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m49s)

[uh material design theme button.sam that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m51s)

[sounds like a great name let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m54s)

[let's copy that because if this ends up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m56s)

[working](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m57s)

[we might as well keep it all right so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h15m59s)

[we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m01s)

[and then we're going to come over here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m02s)

[and we are just going to grab](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m04s)

[this style because this is the most](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m06s)

[basic of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m09s)

[all styles let's grab that and we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m10s)

[just gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m13s)

[plop it in there and see what breaks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m14s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m17s)

[probably darn near everything okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m18s)

[so what's up robert](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m21s)

[uh and actually no not wpf today](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m24s)

[you missed the opening win ui three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m27s)

[still xaml still playing around with it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m32s)

[so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m35s)

[we're going to take a basic win ui 3 app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m36s)

[and i want to see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m40s)

[how easy it is to theme one of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m41s)

[things off](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m43s)

[because if it's easy enough especially](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m45s)

[with project reunion](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m47s)

[we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna take](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m49s)

[a crack at this worst case scenario we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m51s)

[end up doing um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m53s)

[a material design port of for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m55s)

[when when ui three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h16m58s)

[i would not be opposed to that idea but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m05s)

[we are going to see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m08s)

[so first thing right out the gate](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m10s)

[x type was not found so i'm gonna go out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m13s)

[on a limb here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m17s)

[uh win ui three just net core version](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m18s)

[of uis or desktop apps ah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m22s)

[that is a very good question and the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m25s)

[answer is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m27s)

[both so one of the cool](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m28s)

[things that it has right now is there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m31s)

[sort of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m35s)

[two well two there's kind of two top](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m35s)

[level ways that you can do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m38s)

[projects in win ui three you can do the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m41s)

[the uwp approach right so people coming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m44s)

[from uwp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m47s)

[land have a nice easy migration path](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m48s)

[right but we also have this win ui three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m51s)

[in desktop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m54s)

[which is pretty cool so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m55s)

[i'm not a hundred percent confident on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h17m59s)

[this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m01s)

[uh one they they decoupled](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m02s)

[um so when ui three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m06s)

[they decoupled it from the os uh and the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m09s)

[windows sdk](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m12s)

[framework so that the the um the ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m13s)

[layer isn't tightly coupled because even](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m17s)

[in like wpf it's tightly coupled to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m18s)

[directx](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m20s)

[right you can't get away from it um this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m21s)

[is microsoft's evolution to try and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m24s)

[address that and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m26s)

[and get things a little more modular](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m28s)

[right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m31s)

[it is still uwp flavored xaml though](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m31s)

[so that's a that's going to be a little](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m36s)

[different a little different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m37s)

[a little different so but we're gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m39s)

[we're gonna see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m42s)

[i figure i wanna see how hard it is to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m43s)

[do something like a button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m45s)

[and if a button is easy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m47s)

[then we keep going um but right out the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m50s)

[gate x type is not there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m54s)

[so let's uh yeah so the other thing that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m56s)

[i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h18m59s)

[had experienced with this before is i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m00s)

[had a ooh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m02s)

[ooh what do we have here um is i ran](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m04s)

[into](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m07s)

[a lot of problems around um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m08s)

[just being able to see what was going on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m13s)

[and debugging which](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m14s)

[which did that uh how does this fit into](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m16s)

[the whole set of frameworks like maui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m19s)

[blazer desktop and net six oh you have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m21s)

[asked a wonderful question](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m24s)

[um and i don't know if i necessarily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m27s)

[know all of the answers but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m30s)

[i i know enough to give a reasonable](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m32s)

[answer so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m33s)

[net six they are attempting to unify](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m35s)

[all all of the.nets so that there is no](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m38s)

[more](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m42s)

[uh separation of you know you've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m43s)

[you know one.net that you use to write](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m48s)

[desktop one that you use to write web](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m49s)

[one that you use for mobile all that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m51s)

[there's just net six right everyone](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m53s)

[comes together](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m56s)

[one big happy family obviously some apis](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h19m57s)

[don't work on certain platforms](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m00s)

[right just like if you try to access the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m01s)

[compass on a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m03s)

[device that doesn't have a compass well](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m05s)

[that ain't going to work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m06s)

[right um so it does mean that you may](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m08s)

[end up having to do some runtime checks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m11s)

[there's some target framework stuff to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m13s)

[to play with and all that jazz](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m14s)

[but how this fits into maui is one of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m17s)

[the targets that maui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m21s)

[is going to have i believe let me see if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m23s)

[i can find this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m25s)

[uh maui part](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m27s)

[uh c sharp if i type in anything](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m30s)

[the problem with searching for maui is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m34s)

[you end up with a lot of things that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m36s)

[have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m38s)

[uh no relationship whatsoever](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m39s)

[to uh uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m42s)

[to to this uh i believe](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m46s)

[so i'm just trying to confirm what i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m50s)

[think was said](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m52s)

[i believe what i heard is that win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m54s)

[three](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m57s)

[is one of the targets but i want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h20m57s)

[confirm that because i don't know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m00s)

[if that's true or not because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m02s)

[in so maui is kind of like xamarin v](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m05s)

[next](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m08s)

[but it's xamarin v next with a bunch of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m09s)

[breaking changes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m12s)

[right so a whole bunch of like the the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m13s)

[xamarin](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m16s)

[uh namespaces got changed and things are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m17s)

[being brought under like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m20s)

[system or microsoft namespaces so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m21s)

[there's so if you're writing a xamarin](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m23s)

[forms app today](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m26s)

[just know that there's probably some](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m27s)

[find and replace namespace](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m28s)

[action for you i do not see the answer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m31s)

[that i'm looking for so i'm going to go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m35s)

[with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m36s)

[maybe maui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m37s)

[xamarin forms does desktop yeah because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m40s)

[i know because they said](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m42s)

[windows and i'm trying to remember what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m44s)

[windows means](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m46s)

[yeah there it is so in.net maui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m52s)

[win ui 3 microsoft will provide the head](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m56s)

[for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m59s)

[there is still a wpf one that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h21m59s)

[community maintained](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m01s)

[but that was the same in xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m03s)

[as well right there's technically a wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m05s)

[head](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m07s)

[i really don't think i would necessarily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m08s)

[build apps that way i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m12s)

[the the wpf head for xamarin forms](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m15s)

[always felt a little constrained](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m17s)

[because you're doing kind of a least](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m19s)

[common denominator thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m21s)

[i mean you can certainly do platform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m22s)

[specific stuff but it just it felt weird](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m24s)

[and hard](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m26s)

[um but yeah so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m27s)

[that is that is the relationship there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m33s)

[if you are wanting to do win ui 3 and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m34s)

[you want it to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m37s)

[cross plat you can do maui and maui will](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m38s)

[have a win](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m41s)

[ui or will generate a win ui 3](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m42s)

[host that you can use so if you are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m45s)

[happy with your xamarin form stuff and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m47s)

[just want xamarin forms v](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m49s)

[awesome next that would be better](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m51s)

[because you'll note one of the big](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m53s)

[things that they've changed is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m54s)

[dumping it into uh kind of this single](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m56s)

[project e type architecture](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h22m59s)

[right where you know i'm targeting each](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m01s)

[of these other thingies](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m03s)

[and maybe i've got some platform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m04s)

[specific code but for the most part i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m06s)

[just write my stuff once](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m08s)

[because most of the time in xamarin form](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m09s)

[that's kind of what you wanted](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m11s)

[um blazer i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m12s)

[think necessarily fits in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m16s)

[yet i don't i don't know i don't think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m20s)

[i've heard anything in regards to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m23s)

[blazer so for people unfamiliar blazer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m25s)

[is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m28s)

[microsoft's awesome new way of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m29s)

[i hate to call it silverlight v next but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m32s)

[it it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m34s)

[it's better mostly because it doesn't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m36s)

[depend on weird browser stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m39s)

[it just uses um web assembly but it lets](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m41s)

[you build out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m44s)

[website stuff um in a very](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m44s)

[xaml c-sharp friendly way](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m48s)

[so that people who are used to building](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m51s)

[like wpf apps](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m53s)

[like me who don't really know javascript](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m55s)

[don't really want to know javascript can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h23m58s)

[still build web stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m01s)

[and it's pretty cool it's worth noting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m02s)

[blazers there's kind of two halves to it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m04s)

[you've got server and client](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m06s)

[um server i know when went out i believe](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m08s)

[client is ga might still be beta](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m12s)

[don't quite know um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m15s)

[so that's a very long answer to what was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m18s)

[a short question](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m21s)

[so so this is one of the ways](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m24s)

[um and i kind of mentioned this at the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m28s)

[beginning too that win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m29s)

[3 feels like microsoft's next evolution](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m32s)

[of hey guys if you're building a new](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m34s)

[desktop app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m36s)

[this is what you should probably look at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m37s)

[now there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m39s)

[variables to consider though right like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m40s)

[do you have existing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m43s)

[code or whatnot that you need to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m44s)

[maintain](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m46s)

[is wpf a better system for what you want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m48s)

[do you want the msix package in kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m52s)

[easy mode which is what this appears to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m55s)

[be uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m57s)

[there's a stream i did a while back um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h24m58s)

[and i need to revisit it because i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m00s)

[told the msix packaging got better](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m02s)

[but oh man we struggled with getting a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m04s)

[wpf app packaged in msix](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m06s)

[i struggled a lot there's since been](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m08s)

[several blog posts and documentation](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m10s)

[pages written](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m12s)

[so again i should revisit it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m13s)

[but this is sort of the the next one now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m16s)

[should you go to this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m19s)

[kind of depends on what you're building](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m22s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m24s)

[maybe but if wpf is working there's no](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m27s)

[there's no real reason to switch off of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m30s)

[wpf if that's what's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m32s)

[getting the job done uh so if we target](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m34s)

[maui we can just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m36s)

[write it and it can target both desktop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m37s)

[and mobile and then if we have hardware](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m39s)

[specific code](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m41s)

[we write the classes for the platform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m42s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m44s)

[yes um and so with maui there's actually](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m45s)

[a bunch of different ways because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m49s)

[whenever you have these right once](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m50s)

[solutions the the key question is always](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m52s)

[well how do i do platformy specific](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m55s)

[things right because without fail the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m58s)

[right wants solutions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h25m59s)

[never you there's always something you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m01s)

[need to do specific on each platform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m03s)

[right it doesn't matter i i've never](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m05s)

[written a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m07s)

[cross-platform app where i didn't have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m08s)

[to do some platforming specific stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m10s)

[um and so with maui there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m12s)

[different ways to do it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m14s)

[uh that that screenshot that i had up a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m16s)

[second ago where it showed the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m18s)

[individual](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m19s)

[platform classes is one there's runtime](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m19s)

[checks you can do there's pound if check](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m22s)

[methodologies you can do and they've](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m24s)

[also got like on platform flags for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m26s)

[inside of xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m27s)

[to make that friendly as well where it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m28s)

[like hey you know i want my margin to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m30s)

[30 on ios](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m32s)

[and 10 on windows right so there's a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m33s)

[nice little](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m36s)

[zamily way of doing that as well](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m36s)

[and actually in maui you don't even need](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m40s)

[to use xaml if you don't want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m41s)

[they decoupled it from xaml and kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m43s)

[an mvvm pattern](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m46s)

[because they wanted to support something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m48s)

[called mvu](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m49s)

[some model view update uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m51s)

[which was very much popularized by](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m54s)

[clancy's comet repo so if anybody's come](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h26m58s)

[across that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m01s)

[the mvu pattern that you see in maui is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m02s)

[pretty much](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m05s)

[comet brought forward so that's pretty](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m06s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m09s)

[but yes you can do you can have a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m13s)

[hardware or platform specific code in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m16s)

[maui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m18s)

[and just do do run time checks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m19s)

[or if it's compile time known there are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m22s)

[ways to set it up so that you know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m24s)

[this bit of code only gets compiled into](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m26s)

[my ios app for example](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m28s)

[okay so we need a couple things here for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m30s)

[this to work i need](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m32s)

[a primary hue brush primary hearing mid](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m35s)

[brush](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m38s)

[and a primary hue foreground brush so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m38s)

[let's just do this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m40s)

[so a solid color brush](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m41s)

[i have to say this is so far very wpfe](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m45s)

[to me so that's kind of nice the fact](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m48s)

[that i had to drop an x type is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m50s)

[about the only thing so we're going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m52s)

[go with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m54s)

[color purple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m55s)

[for now i'll go and drop this in um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h27m59s)

[at a later point and maybe we'll do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m03s)

[white on top of it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m06s)

[um i'll go and swap these out later](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m07s)

[uh so let's see so what is this guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m11s)

[doing dynamic resource was not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m13s)

[found so is when ui more of a closer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m15s)

[comparison to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m19s)

[wpf than maui's to wpf when ui3 for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m20s)

[desktop is yes um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m24s)

[yeah maui i would say is for people who](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m29s)

[want the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m32s)

[write once share code across multiple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m33s)

[platforms right but if you're going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m35s)

[write a windows app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m37s)

[and only have it run on windows i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m39s)

[think i would reach for maui i think i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m41s)

[reach for maui when i either want to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m43s)

[mobile or cross platform and if i if a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m45s)

[desktop app is what i'm writing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m48s)

[i'm not reaching for that i'm going for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m50s)

[either win ui or wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m52s)

[currently wpf because that's my bread](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m55s)

[and butter but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m57s)

[we're going to see if we can add win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h28m58s)

[to that list](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m00s)

[so dynamic resource doesn't exist so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m02s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m05s)

[that's interesting uh obviously static](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m06s)

[resource exists](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m09s)

[so we're just gonna we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m10s)

[find so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m13s)

[obviously that will be something that i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m14s)

[need to figure out the appropriate](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m16s)

[replacement i vaguely remember there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m17s)

[being something like a theme resource or](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m18s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m20s)

[uh but for now in the interest of just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m21s)

[seeing this work we're gonna go with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m23s)

[we'll just do everything a static](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m25s)

[resource and be done with it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m27s)

[um okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m28s)

[i think what we're gonna do is we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m32s)

[just gonna whack i don't wanna bring](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m33s)

[over all of the attached properties](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m35s)

[uh ripple assist feedback i'm going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m38s)

[leave this because we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m40s)

[having to bring the ripple assist in as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m42s)

[well](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m43s)

[the shadow i think i'm going to take out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m44s)

[so i don't have to bring that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m46s)

[in and all the button in progress this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m47s)

[is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m50s)

[stuff i think we're just going to we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m50s)

[just gonna take](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m53s)

[all that out so i don't have to deal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m54s)

[with it okay so target type](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m55s)

[appears to just want the string not the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h29m57s)

[x type](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m00s)

[and it seems happy with that so that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m01s)

[cool uh a dorner decorator is not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m03s)

[found i'm not overly surprised that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m06s)

[fairly wpf specific so let's let's look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m09s)

[at what we're doing here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m12s)

[so i think what we do is we just try](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m14s)

[dropping this because i don't think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m19s)

[uh i don't think the adorner deck or the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m23s)

[adorner layer is something that actually](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m25s)

[matters](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m27s)

[control template triggers oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m27s)

[are there no triggers in my control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m31s)

[template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m33s)

[well that's um that's a fairly limited](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m34s)

[set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m38s)

[okay uh so we're gonna have to find a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m38s)

[replacement for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m41s)

[all of those too okay so that's that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m44s)

[not a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m46s)

[uh let's see so what do we got next on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m48s)

[the agenda we've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m50s)

[a button assisti thing so we're just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m52s)

[gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m54s)

[take that out is it it's probably not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m56s)

[gonna be hip to that we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m58s)

[delete it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h30m59s)

[uh let's see effect this was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m00s)

[all around shadowing yeah so we're just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m04s)

[gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m07s)

[effect probably doesn't exist yeah i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m08s)

[not overly surprised to find that effect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m10s)

[isn't a thing in here um effects in wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m12s)

[are one of those things that can just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m15s)

[tank performance really quickly so it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m17s)

[not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m20s)

[it's not it doesn't really surprise me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m22s)

[to not see that there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m25s)

[okay so this is all progress assist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m26s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m29s)

[here so we're gonna make this easy and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m30s)

[just whack it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m32s)

[look at that see that and actually i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m33s)

[think the entire premise of the progress](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m35s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m37s)

[we're just not gonna implement right now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m38s)

[that's that's for a later](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m40s)

[a later effort okay so we do need to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m43s)

[bring over the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m45s)

[the ripple multi-binding wasn't found](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m47s)

[really there's no malta](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m52s)

[really](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h31m58s)

[uh oh i guess it probably isn't gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m01s)

[know that let's go up here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m05s)

[do you not have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m09s)

[you do have binding but you don't have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m15s)

[multi-binding](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m18s)

[microsoft ui xaml.data sorry i just want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m19s)

[to go look at this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m23s)

[microsoft.ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m26s)

[mole data](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m29s)

[binding well look at that there's a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m32s)

[binding base](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m35s)

[but there is no multibinding](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m38s)

[well then that's that's exciting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m44s)

[that's uh okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m48s)

[so we got we got some limit we got some](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m51s)

[limitations](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m53s)

[got some limitations uh not sure](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m54s)

[how we're gonna work around that one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h32m58s)

[we'll get to that in a minute](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m00s)

[uh let's go and bring in the ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m01s)

[control i guess so let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m04s)

[add existing item and let's just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m06s)

[i'm gonna bounce out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m10s)

[oh oh shoot](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m13s)

[i put this on the wrong](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m17s)

[hard drive well that's disappointing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m21s)

[uh we'll be moving that later my little](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m24s)

[m2 does not have enough space](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m28s)

[uh okay but we need to go find material](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m31s)

[design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m34s)

[sorry i am doing this on a secondary](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m35s)

[screen for the moment because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m37s)

[i've got a bunch of other stuff nearby](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m39s)

[that i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m41s)

[not supposed to share okay uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m42s)

[there we go so let's come in here so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m46s)

[material design wpf and let's go down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m49s)

[and grab ourselves the ripple control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m51s)

[grab that guy and this guy we're gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h33m58s)

[just do some auto coding](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m01s)

[so change the name space great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m03s)

[uh we're gonna clean all you up and we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m06s)

[got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m09s)

[all kinds of stuff so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m09s)

[template visual state that exists](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m12s)

[great content control are you still a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m16s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m19s)

[what is abi huh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m20s)

[i wonder what's bringing that in okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m24s)

[that's still a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m27s)

[uh let's see is event manager still a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m29s)

[thing i'm gonna go with probably not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m31s)

[yeah not not overly surprised so we will](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m34s)

[probably need to figure out the proper](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m38s)

[way to handle events](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m39s)

[uh let's see mouse button event handler](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m42s)

[uh we will need to figure](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m46s)

[out how to do that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m51s)

[kind of interested in how does this work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m54s)

[there's a using for that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h34m58s)

[uh let's see it's fine name not a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m03s)

[key time do you have others](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m09s)

[animation name space so bring that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m12s)

[forward how about a mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m14s)

[i'm kind of going to be surprised](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m16s)

[yeah not overly surprised that mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m19s)

[doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m21s)

[uh oh and we don't have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m24s)

[well how bad could it be let's turn on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m27s)

[notable reference types while we're at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m30s)

[because i don't wanna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m31s)

[i don't wanna think too hard but i'm i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m34s)

[just about guarantee that's gonna be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m36s)

[uh that's gonna be interesting so we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m39s)

[turned off the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m41s)

[ripple assist all right so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m42s)

[just do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m46s)

[that maneuver that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m48s)

[not quite right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m52s)

[that's what we want that's what we want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h35m55s)

[and then dependency property](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m06s)

[so i don't even know how to do read-only](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m10s)

[dependency properties are those a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m13s)

[there's register attached and register](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m17s)

[interesting okay so we'll have to figure](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m22s)

[out read-only dependency properties too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m24s)

[apply template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m27s)

[uh oh this is protected now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m31s)

[okay that's fine i'm cool with that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m34s)

[let's see ripple assist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m38s)

[i'm just gonna get that out of there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m42s)

[actually you know what it might be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m44s)

[easier to just bring it in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m45s)

[yeah we've already got enough stuff that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m49s)

[we're gonna be figuring out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m51s)

[and i think i want to know how hard it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m55s)

[is to do attached property stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h36m57s)

[which is why i'm starting with button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m00s)

[because it is a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m01s)

[simple control and if i can't do a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m04s)

[simple control well i got no hope for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m07s)

[the rest of the library](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m09s)

[uh okay so let's go and grab that guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m10s)

[too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m20s)

[the good news the coffee or otherwise](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m25s)

[called liquid dirt is now gone](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m28s)

[and we can move on to that doesn't look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m34s)

[like mountain dew can don't worry](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m36s)

[we got back up mountain dew is coming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m38s)

[mountain dews are coming okay so let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m42s)

[just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m45s)

[clean these guys up because it looks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m45s)

[like these ones are probably as simple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m47s)

[as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m49s)

[declared there i assume these are just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m50s)

[property metadatas](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m53s)

[yeah and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h37m55s)

[probably just that simple so this guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m00s)

[had an inherit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m03s)

[i don't know if this guy's going to have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m04s)

[don't know if there's going to be an](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m11s)

[equivalent here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m12s)

[there might not be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m15s)

[there might not be so what we are going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m19s)

[to do is we're just going to whack that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m21s)

[it's the the problem is we've got code](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m23s)

[that relies on the inheritance bit of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m26s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m27s)

[so that'll be that'll be something that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m28s)

[would need to change](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m31s)

[uh so let's do this let's just find](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m33s)

[hey paste um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m37s)

[uh let me let me zoom this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m49s)

[oh that is that is huge uh or tiny](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m52s)

[uh let's see font sizer increase](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m56s)

[editor font size control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h38m59s)

[sorry what was that again font sizer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m03s)

[control plus num see the problem with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m08s)

[that is it assumes that i have that key](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m11s)

[on my keyboard](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m13s)

[and i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m14s)

[my my new clacky keyboard doesn't have a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m18s)

[number pad it is it is a stubby one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m21s)

[uh okay so we're gonna just drop that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m25s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m28s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m30s)

[yeah because we've got all this stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m34s)

[that assumes that you can set these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m36s)

[attached properties on the parent](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m37s)

[controls and it's fine if they don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m39s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m41s)

[it's actually probably better if we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m42s)

[address those and that might be one of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m46s)

[those things that i address](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m48s)

[actually in the the wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m50s)

[xaml 2 is have it not necessarily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m53s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m56s)

[but get passed down appropriately right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h39m57s)

[there's a few places where that gets](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m00s)

[weird where you pass it like five levels](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m02s)

[down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m04s)

[specifically around like the data grid](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m05s)

[ones those get weird um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m07s)

[but it does save a bit of performance if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m11s)

[it doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m14s)

[to do inheritance trees okay so there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m15s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m18s)

[that handles that that handles that i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m19s)

[not really concerned with that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m21s)

[i am interested in mouse button event](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m25s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m28s)

[so i think what we do though is we go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m29s)

[i think we just so one we wanted](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m34s)

[preview](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m37s)

[uh so what is the what are the events](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m43s)

[that that would correspond to mousey](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m46s)

[stuff drag](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m49s)

[holding](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m53s)

[uh i want let's see what do i care about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h40m56s)

[mouse move mouse up i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m00s)

[i want those things](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m04s)

[um oh pointer ah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m07s)

[okay so pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m11s)

[moved is one thing i care about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m14s)

[so grab that all right so that's that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m18s)

[a thing i care about yeah sure fine](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m20s)

[uh and then i want so it's not mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m23s)

[it's pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m25s)

[okay and then i want released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m26s)

[that sounds like another thing i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m32s)

[uh both of these things have the same](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m33s)

[signature that's great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m35s)

[that's great um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m36s)

[you become](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m40s)

[these args become one of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m43s)

[thingamabobbers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m46s)

[just get rid of that that dumb](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m48s)

[and then both of these get pointed to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m52s)

[and then just for sanity we'll rename](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h41m57s)

[this to pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m00s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m02s)

[okay so now that handles that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m06s)

[ripple assist is centered](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m10s)

[oh did we not we didn't move the ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m13s)

[this class did we nope](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m15s)

[move on over okay so that'll fix](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m18s)

[that'll fix those issues we still don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m22s)

[know the read-only](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m24s)

[stuff um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m26s)

[this seems to think i can override](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m29s)

[something what is your problem](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m31s)

[nullable annotation context does](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m34s)

[nullable not work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m36s)

[oh that's going to be dumb if noble](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m38s)

[doesn't work here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m39s)

[noble true it's on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m41s)

[i'm gonna ignore you for the moment um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m44s)

[this one seems to think you can override](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m50s)

[i don't know if that's a legit thing to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m52s)

[assume](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h42m56s)

[i actually should have brought my water](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m03s)

[bottle with me did not do that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m05s)

[that would have been smarter uh let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m07s)

[see points probably](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m08s)

[uh let's see i'm gonna assume windows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m11s)

[foundation i kind of want to know what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m13s)

[this abi dot windows is i'm not familiar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m14s)

[with that namespace](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m17s)

[so that's that's a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m19s)

[uh let's see i wonder if there's like a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m22s)

[a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m25s)

[pointer poi](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m26s)

[can i do like a pointer from abi](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m31s)

[so apparently i need to figure out what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m35s)

[abi is because that's that's clearly a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m36s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m39s)

[um how about this no](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m40s)

[oh this isn't a static method](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m44s)

[uh oh this is a mouse move event handler](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m53s)

[oh so this guy this guy should really be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h43m57s)

[this one and this should really be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m01s)

[renamed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m04s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m06s)

[pointer right and then you become](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m08s)

[one of these okay so that gives me that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m13s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m16s)

[i want can you give me the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m18s)

[so this is so what are we after i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m27s)

[the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m30s)

[position of the pointer relative to my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m30s)

[ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m33s)

[right that's all i'm after so that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m34s)

[probably as simple as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m36s)

[i think i just saw like a get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m39s)

[get current point relative to that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m42s)

[sounds like exactly what i want i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m44s)

[to get the point relative to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m46s)

[ripple right boom](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m48s)

[see we can find our way through these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m52s)

[apis](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m54s)

[poof problem solved um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m55s)

[i'm sorry what this is the problem with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h44m59s)

[var now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m01s)

[use explicit type input experimental](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m03s)

[oh boy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m07s)

[boy that's exciting okay so what is on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m11s)

[this relative position thingy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m14s)

[right so we just want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m20s)

[dot position](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m24s)

[right and then this becomes point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m29s)

[there we go that's that's all i care](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m33s)

[about i don't care about the other stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m35s)

[i just i just i just want numbers x and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m37s)

[y coordinates are fine thank you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m39s)

[uh so we may need to come back to left](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m41s)

[mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m44s)

[button down apparently this did not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m45s)

[update to match](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m49s)

[boom be there be happy okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m52s)

[now we want to peruse our template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m56s)

[looking for particular thingymabobbers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h45m59s)

[so under ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m02s)

[template is a thing uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m05s)

[there's got to be some sort of find me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m09s)

[the thingy uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m11s)

[how do i get a template member](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m15s)

[uh is there some sort of like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m23s)

[how about ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m26s)

[find name](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m29s)

[so we just drop template and we just do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m34s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m40s)

[yeah and then we drop this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m44s)

[that seems easier it seems like a much](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m48s)

[more intuitive api](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m52s)

[okay assuming it works the same way](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m54s)

[i like it this should probably be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h46m57s)

[pattern matched but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m00s)

[meh that's for that's for after it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m01s)

[working](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m04s)

[uh okay so that handles that that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m05s)

[handles that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m08s)

[just clean these up boom](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m10s)

[those ones get cleaned up that gets](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m13s)

[cleaned up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m15s)

[now what are we doing here we've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m16s)

[when the left mouse button gets](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m19s)

[pressed we want to do stuff so i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m21s)

[think for this what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m24s)

[we're just going to register it up here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m27s)

[pointer pressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m31s)

[when i press action within the element](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m37s)

[that sounds kind of like what i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m42s)

[boom oh that's probably going to be a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m47s)

[problem uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m50s)

[fine we'll keep the name uh let's go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m54s)

[down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m57s)

[here and we're just gonna drop that in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h47m58s)

[drop that in and then we don't need this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m02s)

[base](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m05s)

[thingy call anymore i think what we saw](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m06s)

[before](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m09s)

[is this is e dot](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m10s)

[i get current point relative to this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m13s)

[dot position there is a no reference](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m17s)

[possibility here that i'm almost assured](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m20s)

[to find](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m23s)

[but you know what deal with that later](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m24s)

[no references okay so inner content](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m27s)

[transform to an](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m30s)

[ancestor so what is this doing is this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m32s)

[is trying to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m35s)

[so this finds the inner content](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m44s)

[takes the zero zero takes the origin](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m48s)

[point from that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m50s)

[content](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m52s)

[and transforms it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m55s)

[this should just be getting the point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h48m58s)

[relative to the parent](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m00s)

[so um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m15s)

[uh transform to visual appears to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m28s)

[what we want instead](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m30s)

[let's see transform to visual gives me a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m35s)

[general transform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m38s)

[and then a general transform should](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m41s)

[probably be able to oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m45s)

[transform point but that sounds awful a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m48s)

[lot like what i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m51s)

[boom and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m53s)

[let's use explicit type okay so that was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m56s)

[easy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h49m59s)

[okay so now we just have this issue](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m00s)

[um and i think what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m05s)

[drop the concept of needing a read only](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m07s)

[drops the pro concept of that and just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m10s)

[go with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m13s)

[straight up dependency property](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m14s)

[right and we're going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m24s)

[uh so we're gonna drop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m30s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m34s)

[this guy here purple size property we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m38s)

[going to drop the word](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m42s)

[key drop that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m43s)

[uh drop the word key off of that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m48s)

[drop the word key off of that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m52s)

[and we're just going to register these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m55s)

[up as regular dependency properties](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h50m57s)

[and that should](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m00s)

[get us with this compiling](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m03s)

[okay so that that's a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m11s)

[and we are now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m15s)

[wpf is an undeclared prefix if we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m19s)

[down to one error i'm i'm pretty happy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m21s)

[um sorry where what line was that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m24s)

[line 40 oh so we want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m29s)

[this is going to become oh local](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m33s)

[because we brought this guy in here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m36s)

[okay so content string format](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m40s)

[i think we're just going to drop that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m43s)

[because that isn't a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m44s)

[focusable apparently isn't a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m47s)

[snap to device pixels isn't a thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m50s)

[that's actually really happy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m52s)

[okay so we got all of that in got all of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m55s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h51m59s)

[okay so next up let's come over to here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m01s)

[i would like to take this button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m05s)

[style static resource boom i would like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m09s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m13s)

[that right uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m14s)

[content click me i i kind of i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m18s)

[i prefer that all right let's get this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m21s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m24s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m25s)

[yeah and i wouldn't expect you to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m28s)

[able to find it so in wpf land we have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m29s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m32s)

[include the resource window](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m33s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m36s)

[no it doesn't just pick it up does it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m39s)

[is it like smart about this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m42s)

[that would be interesting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m49s)

[uh true for noble oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m52s)

[that's why it was still squawking](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m56s)

[because true isn't a real thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h52m57s)

[uh enable](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m00s)

[yeah and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m12s)

[uh let's see focus visual style](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m15s)

[doesn't exist on button base okay not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m18s)

[surprised that one would drop](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m21s)

[uh let's see what else we got unknown](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m23s)

[ripple assist feedback uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m27s)

[i thought we just brought in oh this is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m30s)

[going to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m33s)

[local right uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m35s)

[cursor doesn't exist not surprised](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m38s)

[uh text block font size so let's i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m43s)

[assume it's just going to be this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m46s)

[all right so let's do that let's do that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m49s)

[let's see what happens there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m51s)

[really nice that this is actually](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h53m59s)

[blowing up at compile time](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m00s)

[not run time that's actually](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m02s)

[fairly comforting i mean some of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m06s)

[things would also blow up in wpf at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m09s)

[compile time as well uh xaml parsing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m12s)

[failed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m15s)

[that's exciting um can you be any more](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m16s)

[specific](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m19s)

[apparently not apparently](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m22s)

[not this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m25s)

[this is where i got annoyed with with it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m29s)

[previously](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m32s)

[um so it's in the generated code](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m33s)

[line 39](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m39s)

[i have a sinking suspicion](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m44s)

[if i go looking at this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m48s)

[yeah so about that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m51s)

[okay so how does one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m54s)

[i think this is the part where we start](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h54m58s)

[we start we start the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m00s)

[the the googling with bing uh so when](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m02s)

[ui3 include resource](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m05s)

[dictionary right so we want to start](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m09s)

[there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m11s)

[so here's this guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m19s)

[um okay so theme so theme resource is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m23s)

[likely](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m27s)

[our replacement for dynamic resource](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m28s)

[that we want to use that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m29s)

[that's fine that is f oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m31s)

[i just had a crazy idea](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m35s)

[it would be really cool to write a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m38s)

[source generator](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m40s)

[to go between wpf markup and when ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m42s)

[markup](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m46s)

[that will be a stream for a different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m48s)

[day that would be a stream for a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m49s)

[different day and totally awesome](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m51s)

[okay i just wonder how much how much](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m56s)

[beating it's gonna take](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h55m58s)

[right but i wonder if it would be easier](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m01s)

[or harder to maintain a set of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m03s)

[transformation rules than it would be to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m05s)

[just maintain two separate bits of code](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m06s)

[uh so theme resource we're gonna put you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m09s)

[to the side](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m11s)

[and come back over here resource](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m13s)

[dictionary blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m14s)

[page application resources does window](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m17s)

[just not have resources](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m22s)

[is that the deal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m31s)

[does window just not have resources](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m37s)

[this looks to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m44s)

[this is okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m49s)

[so the only thing i noticed is they only](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m52s)

[showed at the application and the page](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m55s)

[level they don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m57s)

[show it at a window level so perhaps](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h56m58s)

[window doesn't have it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m00s)

[okay well that's that's fine we can come](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m04s)

[over here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m06s)

[uh other merge dictionaries here okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m08s)

[so how about resource dictionary source](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m12s)

[blue intellisense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m19s)

[visual studio material](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m23s)

[design theme button.xml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m27s)

[right something like that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m35s)

[load](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m38s)

[well worst case scenario we get the same](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m43s)

[air that we got last time](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m45s)

[cannot be that bad](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m48s)

[oh oh buddy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m51s)

[i don't know why](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h57m58s)

[i don't know why previously it had a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m02s)

[white border and now it doesn't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m03s)

[and more importantly it doesn't do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m06s)

[anything when i click on it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m07s)

[so it's a colossal failure](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m11s)

[but it runs so note to self](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m15s)

[if you have a static resource](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m19s)

[that cannot be resolved you just get a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m22s)

[useless exception](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m23s)

[okay good to know good to know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m25s)

[okay but](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m28s)

[but but but but this gives me a small](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m31s)

[amount of hope that we can theme this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m34s)

[sucker out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m36s)

[okay so we got a button um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m38s)

[now there's a couple there's a couple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m42s)

[obvious things that that didn't look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m44s)

[right so let's launch this guy one more](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m46s)

[time i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m47s)

[wonder how the edit and continue works](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m48s)

[because i am noticing this thing as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m53s)

[being really hip um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m55s)

[and respecting my my windows theming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h58m57s)

[which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m00s)

[not gonna lie so okay so for starters](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m02s)

[there's a couple things going on right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m05s)

[we've got this guy here he's got this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m08s)

[white border](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m11s)

[oh i wonder do does the live visual tree](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m13s)

[work on this thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m16s)

[because i know snoop isn't going to uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m17s)

[live visual tree hey](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m20s)

[look at that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m25s)

[look at that that's exactly what i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m28s)

[because you'll note the thing had a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m36s)

[white border a minute ago](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m38s)

[white border is gone that bothers me a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m40s)

[great deal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m43s)

[right why why was the border there a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m44s)

[minute ago](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m48s)

[and why is my streaming](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m48s)

[suffering because slack has decided it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m52s)

[wants to do something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m56s)

[uh slack is going to shut down now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=00h59m59s)

[we'll see if we can give it i don't know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m06s)

[why slack decided it needed the gpu](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m07s)

[hands off slack](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m10s)

[you are you you do not get to run my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m13s)

[computer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m15s)

[um okay so we do have this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m16s)

[okay we need to change something okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m19s)

[first of all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m22s)

[this is annoying me uh okay so let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m24s)

[structure this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m27s)

[is a little weird okay get that okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m28s)

[here's what we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m33s)

[uh so we're gonna we're gonna make this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m37s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m39s)

[uh counter](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m41s)

[all right so we're just gonna do we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m45s)

[gonna go this route](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m48s)

[boom all right so we will](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m51s)

[all the zero initialization is stupid](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m56s)

[isn't it yeah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h00m58s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m11s)

[i don't know why the white border starts](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m15s)

[there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m17s)

[nor do i know why it goes away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m19s)

[but we can see that as i click that goes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m22s)

[up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m25s)

[okay so a few things i'm noticing right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m25s)

[away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m29s)

[right so first of all the the look of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m30s)

[these buttons](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m34s)

[is supposed to be curved right there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m34s)

[supposed to be some](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m38s)

[some amount of that and i'm trying to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m39s)

[figure out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m41s)

[i i mean i see why it's not curving](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m44s)

[right now because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m45s)

[quite frankly there is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m48s)

[uh nothing to cause that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m52s)

[and actually this grid is now we'll](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m56s)

[leave the grid for now because if we put](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h01m58s)

[the progress button back in that might](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m00s)

[be needed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m04s)

[we dropped the default corner radius](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m07s)

[didn't we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m09s)

[we did here i'm gonna just open material](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m11s)

[design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m13s)

[um so i can compare and contrast because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m15s)

[i think what i'm going to do is just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m18s)

[bring in whatever the default corner](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m20s)

[radius is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m23s)

[i i know we weren't going to bring in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m24s)

[all of the assist classes but let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m26s)

[let's bring in oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m28s)

[visual studio you need to deal with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m32s)

[increased font sizes this is not okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m34s)

[let's save that for later and submit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m43s)

[feedback because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m45s)

[this little dialogue has been annoying](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m48s)

[me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m50s)

[and i refuse to give feedback while the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m51s)

[thing is that big](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m53s)

[we will provide feedback later](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m55s)

[uh so let's start with themes and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h02m58s)

[button again and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m02s)

[close that okay so this guy here had a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m08s)

[corner radius that came in from the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m11s)

[button assist corner radius](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m12s)

[and we dropped that but what is the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m14s)

[default](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m16s)

[default corner radius is two on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m17s)

[everything okay so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m19s)

[do this because i assume this guy still](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m21s)

[has a corner radius or similar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m22s)

[right yeah great so we're just gonna set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m24s)

[it to two](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m26s)

[right we'll start to get that rounded](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m27s)

[look and i'm kind of wondering if that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m28s)

[white border is some sort of like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m30s)

[focused assist i know it's not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m32s)

[i know what that's not what it's called](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m36s)

[but i don't know what to call it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m37s)

[because i'm wondering if it goes away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m40s)

[right so see it's right there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m42s)

[i wonder if it goes away if i tap see it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m43s)

[does](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m46s)

[so it's something to indicate the focus](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m48s)

[the keyboard focus right and so if i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m51s)

[spacebar it counts you'll note](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m54s)

[if we zoom in that did give us rounded](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h03m59s)

[corners](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m02s)

[okay so that got us that got us to there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m04s)

[uh i am going to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m06s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m10s)

[let's just go wait you don't have a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m13s)

[background](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m17s)

[that not cool](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m21s)

[uh white](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m32s)

[so it does update on the fly that's kind](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m37s)

[of nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m39s)

[okay so we'll do this if you're gonna if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m40s)

[you're gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m43s)

[do xaml live update for me let's have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m44s)

[fun](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m47s)

[all right so that goes like that that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m49s)

[goes like that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m51s)

[that goes like that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m53s)

[uh it's not hip to that okay fine](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h04m56s)

[but that should work to give me a white](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m01s)

[background on my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m03s)

[windows or my window singular](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m05s)

[right and then this guy comes out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m09s)

[there's that obnoxious border around it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m20s)

[i think though that is probably less](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m24s)

[good than not doing that simply because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m27s)

[the selection bit is clearly designed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m30s)

[based on the windows theme i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m35s)

[really want to change my windows theme](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m38s)

[right now](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m39s)

[okay so that gives me that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m40s)

[um actually you know what we should do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m43s)

[we should do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m45s)

[background something like a dark gray](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m46s)

[right no oh that's right dark gray is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m51s)

[actually lighter than gray if i remember](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h05m55s)

[here let's just do this zero x](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m03s)

[um i don't know two two two two](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m06s)

[two two all right give me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m09s)

[there because dark theme is rarely black](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m22s)

[it's usually you know dark](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m25s)

[okay that looks better okay so that gets](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m31s)

[me](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m35s)

[closer um and then just to be clear the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m35s)

[the target that we're shooting for just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m40s)

[open this guy up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m43s)

[and we'll see what we can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m45s)

[these guys need to go to theme stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m50s)

[progress we don't care about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m53s)

[the ripple i would like to figure out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h06m56s)

[so specifically what this is here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m00s)

[right so if we go buttons right we are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m03s)

[basically attempting to build out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m07s)

[this button here right so when i click](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m09s)

[it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m12s)

[i expect that to happen right and so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m12s)

[right now i have this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m15s)

[and i'm not getting any ripple feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m18s)

[so let's jump to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m20s)

[our ripply control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m22s)

[and confirm that we are getting in fact](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m26s)

[what we think we are](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m29s)

[so this would be like pointer pressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m30s)

[so if we come here and i that is the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m34s)

[wrong app let's try again](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m36s)

[that's a better app if i click okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m39s)

[is centered no get current position](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m43s)

[uh 43 16 ripple x ripple y](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m48s)

[go to state templated state normal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m54s)

[templates oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m57s)

[because i haven't i don't have a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h07m58s)

[template for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m00s)

[a ripple added in yet](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m01s)

[okay uh let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m06s)

[go and add that so that kind of makes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m09s)

[sense the ripple would draw nothing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m12s)

[and do nothing because it has been given](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m14s)

[nothing to work with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m17s)

[so new item](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m18s)

[uh let's call this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m21s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m24s)

[theme ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m28s)

[and then let's go and grab the code](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m32s)

[i think it's hiding under generic yeah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m42s)

[there it is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m44s)

[so i just want this whole style come](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m45s)

[here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m48s)

[and we will put you here and then before](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m49s)

[i forget to do it i'm going to go and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m53s)

[add you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m55s)

[here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m56s)

[it is actually kind of convenient if all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h08m59s)

[of your resource dictionaries just get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m03s)

[added at this level](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m04s)

[because that resource tree walking i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m07s)

[know is one of the other things that can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m09s)

[really bite you in wpf if it gets too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m10s)

[deep](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m12s)

[but okay so we got a lot of stuff going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m13s)

[on okay so first thing we know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m16s)

[is that we drop x type and we just type](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m18s)

[the name in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m21s)

[right but this is probably supposed to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m21s)

[be local colon ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m24s)

[i imagine all right if i f12 on that it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m26s)

[takes me there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m29s)

[excellent um okay so once again this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m30s)

[there is no x type there's just the type](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m33s)

[so that's fine that's fine we can we can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m37s)

[work with this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m39s)

[uh let's see so that's all that's all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m41s)

[good there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m43s)

[that's all good there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m46s)

[so visual state stuff yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m49s)

[we'll leave it as is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m51s)

[okay so we got a canvas](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m52s)

[and we got style triggers ripple on top](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h09m55s)

[do styles not have triggers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m00s)

[dear heavens what happened to all my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m03s)

[triggers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m04s)

[there are no triggers okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m08s)

[what the heck has triggers on it do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m11s)

[elements have triggers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m13s)

[something has to have a trigger right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m18s)

[they didn't just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m19s)

[okay so there are triggers on elements](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m21s)

[okay so that's that's that's okay then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m24s)

[right we can we can work around we can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m28s)

[work around this that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m30s)

[that's that's actually more convenient](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m31s)

[because the triggers that exist on wp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m34s)

[alpha elements are only for event](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m36s)

[triggers](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m38s)

[which are arguably one of the hardest](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m38s)

[use case triggers to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m41s)

[to come up with okay so this guy is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m42s)

[squawking about his](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m45s)

[panel z index why](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m47s)

[this is dumb because the z index](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m52s)

[is already set to one because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m55s)

[we're inside of a grid](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h10m58s)

[yeah so that's that's that's just not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m02s)

[a snap device to pixels doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m05s)

[recognize access keys doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m07s)

[content stream format doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m10s)

[apparently so we're just going to whack](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m12s)

[it because we aren't even using it in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m13s)

[this use case anyway](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m14s)

[okay so there's all of that now i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m16s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m23s)

[i'm curious because this this one here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m27s)

[was an explicit style with an x key](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m30s)

[this is an implicit style i wonder if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m32s)

[it's just gonna pick it up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m36s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m38s)

[on wpf land that would be enough](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m43s)

[i don't know uh so hold on we got a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m46s)

[couple more that we missed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m49s)

[so clip to bounds doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m50s)

[okay that's fine](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m54s)

[just get rid of that z index on canvas](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h11m57s)

[oh that's why it was setting its z index](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m08s)

[explicitly because the canvas was moving](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m10s)

[itself](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m12s)

[up and down in the z order ah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m13s)

[it was explicitly setting it to one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m17s)

[because the canvas would bounce between](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m19s)

[zero and two](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m21s)

[got it makes sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m24s)

[makes sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m28s)

[i suspect this may be something that we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m33s)

[end up having like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m35s)

[it's probably kind of a weird use case](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m37s)

[okay so we are going to tab off of there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m41s)

[and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m45s)

[there's that so let's continue](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m48s)

[i don't see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m53s)

[no ripply effect so something isn't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h12m56s)

[working and i don't know what so let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m01s)

[see what is supposed to happen here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m04s)

[so it's supposed to go to state mouse](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m06s)

[pressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m08s)

[right so if we come over here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m09s)

[all right and again i'm i'm making](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m13s)

[sweeping assumptions that this works the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m15s)

[way i think it does](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m16s)

[right so it goes to state normal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m18s)

[right which clears some stuff out and it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m21s)

[goes there immediately because this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m23s)

[boolean is all about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m24s)

[whether you use transitional states or](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m25s)

[not right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m27s)

[this one says go to state press to go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m30s)

[ahead and use transitions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m36s)

[and then this guy here so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m43s)

[so i just want to first confirm that a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m51s)

[we're getting there right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m53s)

[okay perfect so it's hitting those](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m54s)

[states](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m57s)

[those transitional states](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h13m59s)

[right we've got these guys here should](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m02s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m05s)

[over in our template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m06s)

[i'm just wondering if it's not picking](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m09s)

[this up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m11s)

[how would i know oh i know we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m12s)

[check our live visual tree and we can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m16s)

[confirm that it's got all of the stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m19s)

[in it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m21s)

[perfect right so it did pick up this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m22s)

[style](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m24s)

[because i can see that the the template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m25s)

[elements right i can see underneath](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m27s)

[my ripple it grabbed the grid right and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m29s)

[underneath the grid it grabbed the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m32s)

[canvas](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m34s)

[and underneath that it grabbed there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m34s)

[the the ellipse which is this guy right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m37s)

[here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m39s)

[right the name click ellipse right there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m39s)

[and then there's the content presenter](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m42s)

[perfect okay so it did it did pick up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m44s)

[my style my style does have some visual](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m49s)

[states](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m53s)

[on mouse pressed what does it do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m54s)

[so it transforms the scale x and scale y](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h14m58s)

[of the scale transform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m03s)

[uh so where is scale transform defined](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m09s)

[that is here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m13s)

[i don't know why we have all of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m16s)

[others](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m18s)

[in here just going to take those out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m20s)

[um so it should cause this thing to go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m24s)

[this guy's background color is what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m28s)

[fill template binding feedback so this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m33s)

[guy is looking for the feedback property](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m36s)

[so let's just check here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m38s)

[show properties right and i want to look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m40s)

[at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m43s)

[feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m43s)

[let's see feed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m47s)

[back](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m50s)

[hello](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m54s)

[hello where is my feedback property](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h15m58s)

[uh oh i'm sorry](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m02s)

[the fill property is apparently](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m06s)

[zero now do i see that change as i press](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m09s)

[no so that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m13s)

[so this guy here clearly didn't get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m17s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m19s)

[so this is coming from the the template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m21s)

[binding which would be the feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m23s)

[property on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m25s)

[the the thing that's being templated so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m27s)

[in this case the ripple so if we go up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m29s)

[to the ripple](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m30s)

[i am now looking for feedback feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m31s)

[is apparently set to zero which is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m35s)

[just awesome uh which is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m38s)

[i'm not entirely sure how that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m42s)

[possible given that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m43s)

[i'm i'm pretty sure feedback is a brush](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m45s)

[right it is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m50s)

[so there's that so i'm guessing zero](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m55s)

[rendered here must be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m57s)

[must be garbage so let's just set this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h16m59s)

[to red](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m01s)

[okay so now if i click here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m03s)

[okay so now we're getting a ripple okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m12s)

[so that's that's nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m16s)

[and it is in fact going based upon my my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m20s)

[cursor's pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m22s)

[okay so couple issues one it's not being](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m23s)

[clipped](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m26s)

[so clipping is a thing that we need to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m28s)

[turn on and i know we deleted a bunch of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m30s)

[clipping wpf properties so we need to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m32s)

[find the equivalent there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m33s)

[two i thought i'm not mistaken the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m37s)

[ripple is expected to disappear](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m40s)

[after it reaches its max size the other](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m44s)

[thing is it's going kind of slow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m46s)

[compared to the wpf one the wpf one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m48s)

[seems to go a lot quicker](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m50s)

[yeah so there's there's something to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m54s)

[said there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m56s)

[so what is expected to happen](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h17m57s)

[so how does it get from pressed to not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m01s)

[pressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m10s)

[okay so there is there's something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m15s)

[something going on there that is that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m19s)

[definitely different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m21s)

[and i don't know what it is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m26s)

[and i have to believe it is down based](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m29s)

[around](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m32s)

[this because if i just do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m32s)

[yeah so that's that's part of the issue](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m38s)

[there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m42s)

[okay so something's going on with that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m42s)

[ripple so let's figure out the clipping](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m44s)

[first](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m46s)

[right so we want to get this guy here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m46s)

[and i want to remember what i took off](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m50s)

[of here that was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m53s)

[clipping it so this if we come down here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m54s)

[in wpf land](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m57s)

[one of these guys was clipping this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h18m58s)

[ripple control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m02s)

[width height](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m06s)

[uh let's see did you do was it the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m09s)

[ripple itself that was clipping clip to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m13s)

[bounds](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m16s)

[yes so ripple was clipping to bounds](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m18s)

[so let's go up here and i want to look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m22s)

[at what exists on this thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m24s)

[for the purposes of clipping this dot](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m27s)

[and let's just do clip uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m30s)

[oh interesting so it has](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m35s)

[so it just has a straight up clip](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m41s)

[property okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m42s)

[let's go here so a we know that the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m46s)

[feedback property isn't being set the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m50s)

[way we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m51s)

[what we need let's look at the clip](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m52s)

[property now too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m54s)

[because we know you exist](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h19m57s)

[do you not show](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m01s)

[so clip is not set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m07s)

[isn't is isn't this settable didn't it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m11s)

[not what we just saw](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m14s)

[get set yeah what's a new what's a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m15s)

[rectangular geometry look like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m19s)

[i mean i know what a rectangle looks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m22s)

[like but what does a rectangle geometry](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m23s)

[look like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m25s)

[that's great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m31s)

[that tells me almost nothing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m34s)

[you have so a rectangle](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m44s)

[how about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m46s)

[if i just do this new right uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m49s)

[rectangle geometry correct](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m54s)

[gets new rect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h20m58s)

[and it's going to be i believe this is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m01s)

[the same](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m03s)

[right so x is zero y is zero](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m05s)

[with is actual width](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m08s)

[uh actual](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m12s)

[height right and i think both of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m17s)

[are going to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m20s)

[it may not be necessary to set this here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m22s)

[let's do it in on size changed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m23s)

[it's probably better uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m25s)

[respect clipping](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m32s)

[from attached property](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m37s)

[okay and then let's deal with the the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m41s)

[feedback property that was being set so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m44s)

[up here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m46s)

[did we just delete it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m49s)

[that would have been bad let's go and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m53s)

[look at the button template from wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m55s)

[then again](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h21m57s)

[let's see ripple where did your feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m00s)

[get set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m03s)

[where does your feedback get set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m05s)

[where is ripple feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m12s)

[oh is it set like as an attached](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m19s)

[property and it propagates down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m21s)

[that would be yucky](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m25s)

[ripple feedback yeah look at that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m32s)

[so it is set uh that's set on a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m35s)

[different style](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m39s)

[find next flat button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m41s)

[floating floating](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m45s)

[flat really so it's not set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m48s)

[wait what that can't no it's set](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m56s)

[somewhere where](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m58s)

[is it set uh material design raise](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h22m59s)

[button ripple assist feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m03s)

[white yeah so that so that's probably](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m05s)

[what we dropped](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m09s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m10s)

[oh but this isn't this isn't pro so this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m17s)

[is the problem right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m19s)

[this used to be this was an attached](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m20s)

[property that was propagating down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m23s)

[it's no longer propagating right so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m25s)

[this is a good example so how would we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m29s)

[fix this and we could fix this the exact](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m31s)

[same way in wp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m33s)

[here i'm just going to kill execution](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m34s)

[for the moment we could fix this the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m35s)

[same way in wpf land 2](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m37s)

[of not making this propagate right and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m39s)

[explicitly](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m42s)

[pass it right so right before we were](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m43s)

[just setting it up on the root control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m45s)

[and that attached property would go down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m47s)

[to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m48s)

[all of its children and now what we're](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m49s)

[saying is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m51s)

[well let's not do that right let's be a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m52s)

[little more explicit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m54s)

[uh and i wonder if i can get away with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m56s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h23m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m00s)

[uh so in wpf land you couldn't get away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m06s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m09s)

[um but i'm i'm gonna try it here because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m10s)

[i wanna know if they fixed it or made it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m14s)

[work i guess it's the better way](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m16s)

[before you couldn't do a template but in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m19s)

[wpf lane you cannot do a template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m20s)

[binding to an attached property you have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m22s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m24s)

[a relative binding um all the way into](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m25s)

[it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m28s)

[and i'm curious if this will work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m29s)

[what is this thing that it's squawking](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m38s)

[about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m40s)

[oh fix that so it stops yelling](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m42s)

[it works template bindings work](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m50s)

[so aside from the fact that that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m54s)

[really slow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h24m56s)

[oh yeah oh yeah this is good](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m01s)

[okay i like this see this is progress](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m04s)

[progress okay so given that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m08s)

[if that will](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m12s)

[propagate out like that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m15s)

[the next question then is because you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m19s)

[can see how once the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m21s)

[the ripple spreads it doesn't actually](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m23s)

[go away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m25s)

[right and in in wpf land once it reaches](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m26s)

[the end it goes away so we've got two](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m30s)

[things](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m32s)

[i guess next on the dock right i want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m33s)

[fix the speed of that transition](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m35s)

[because i it's got to be like a default](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m38s)

[is different in win ui versus wpf right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m42s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m44s)

[the rate of that change is much too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m45s)

[small](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m47s)

[and then the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m48s)

[the other bit that i'm more concerned](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m52s)

[with is how does it go away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m53s)

[in wpf land right so what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m55s)

[let's look at this the visual state so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h25m58s)

[this guy here would do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m02s)

[what so scale would go back to zero](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m03s)

[mouse out would go back to zero so the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m07s)

[question is are we going back to the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m09s)

[normal state](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m11s)

[what is the trigger for that so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m13s)

[to do so we can kind of just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m16s)

[we can kind of just hunt this state](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m20s)

[transition right and just say what sends](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m23s)

[us to the normal state](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m26s)

[so pointer released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m30s)

[would put us back into the normal state](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m41s)

[the click puts us back into the normal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m48s)

[state but only temporarily an on apply](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m50s)

[template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m52s)

[so i'm gonna go with the released is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m52s)

[probably not doing what we expect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m54s)

[that's that's my working theory so i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m57s)

[gonna i wanna catch it here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h26m58s)

[and let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m01s)

[yeah so down up and we're not hitting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m05s)

[the break point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m10s)

[pointer released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m13s)

[oh interesting note at the end of a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m24s)

[press](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m28s)

[action note that the end of a press](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m28s)

[action is not guaranteed to fire a point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m31s)

[to release](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m33s)

[event other events may fire instead c](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m34s)

[remarks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m36s)

[well i kind of would like to read that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m37s)

[whole block of text please](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m39s)

[uh that is not useful whatsoever](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m42s)

[uh let's see here can i do just that one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m48s)

[uh so that worked remarkably better than](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m54s)

[i expected](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m56s)

[uh f1 for anybody wanting that keystroke](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h27m57s)

[normally i've found that it doesn't do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m01s)

[what i want but in this case it did](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m03s)

[exactly what i wanted](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m04s)

[so i'm pointer released so see remarks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m06s)

[touch mouse and pen stylus receive](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m10s)

[process and manage pointer blah blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m12s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m14s)

[uh for more events see handle pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m15s)

[input we may](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m18s)

[this looks like a page that might be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m20s)

[important right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m22s)

[other events instead of point of release](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m23s)

[may fire at the end of an action](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m26s)

[uh pointer canceled pointer capture lost](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m28s)

[don't rely on pointer pressed and point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m32s)

[to released events](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m34s)

[always occurring in pairs great that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m36s)

[exactly what we were doing to function](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m38s)

[properly](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m40s)

[app must listen for and handle all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m41s)

[events that represent likely conditions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m43s)

[or likely conclusions to the press](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m45s)

[actions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m47s)

[um okay so what i would really like to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m49s)

[know then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m52s)

[what are the conclusions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m54s)

[because i do not appear to be getting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h28m58s)

[those the way that we expect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m01s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m03s)

[oh this is this is much better](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m07s)

[uh pointer move pointer pressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m11s)

[uh indicates a press action such as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m16s)

[touchdown pen down or touchpad down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m18s)

[within](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m20s)

[the bounding area of an element capture](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m21s)

[pointer must be called from the handler](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m23s)

[of this event ah so maybe that's the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m25s)

[thingy that we are not doing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m28s)

[and we should probably](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m36s)

[oh perfect so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m40s)

[i would like to see that one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m46s)

[right uh let's see tb](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m50s)

[uh so we have to try and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m55s)

[capture the sucker that's fine](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h29m58s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m04s)

[how do we then get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m09s)

[released is that the is that the deal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m13s)

[release pointer capture](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m16s)

[so we need to do i think we need both of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m19s)

[those right so released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m22s)

[when removed i'm curious where the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m33s)

[uh canceled by the platform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m42s)

[uh so we probably need to handle a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m46s)

[pointer cancelled](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m49s)

[pointer capture lost and pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m50s)

[released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m53s)

[and we need to capture the pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m54s)

[inside of our thingy okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m56s)

[so we can do this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h30m57s)

[uh so real quick](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m02s)

[this guy here is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m05s)

[let's let's rename this uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m10s)

[and uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m14s)

[pointer event sure sure fine whatever](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m17s)

[we're gonna call it that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m21s)

[um so i think what we do is we do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m22s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m27s)

[of one specified pointer so we are going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m38s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m42s)

[right so we are going to give it its](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m46s)

[pointer and release it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h31m48s)

[because i assume this is what's setting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m01s)

[the new time](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m03s)

[right because the the ti so this one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m05s)

[here it's worth noting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m07s)

[you can see how slow that is while i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m09s)

[hold the mouse button down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m11s)

[and how it speeds up at the end so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m15s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m17s)

[that i think that's yeah so that that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m18s)

[definitely the the released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m20s)

[so in the down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m23s)

[or the pressed i guess right we want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m26s)

[this guy to come in here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m28s)

[and we want to call this dot](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m31s)

[capture pointer we will capture it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m37s)

[okay in addition to released i'm going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m41s)

[to move this down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m44s)

[we want to we want to grab a few other](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m45s)

[things so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m48s)

[pointer cancelled](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m50s)

[endpointer event right and then](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m55s)

[uh pointer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h32m58s)

[capture lost right we want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m02s)

[in all of those situations we're going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m07s)

[to treat it the same as if we were to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m08s)

[just lift the mouse okay so now let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m11s)

[let's launch and see if we've addressed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m14s)

[that problem](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m17s)

[okay back over here get that off there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m29s)

[so click ah break point](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m32s)

[break point yes okay so i want to see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m36s)

[do you find so you didn't find the scale](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m41s)

[transform which means this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m44s)

[doesn't work the same way i that it that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m46s)

[i was hoping it would](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m48s)

[because before we found the template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m50s)

[member](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m52s)

[um okay so we need to figure out how](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m54s)

[how we get access to thingies](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h33m58s)

[in the template right there has to be a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m02s)

[way](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m05s)

[to get the template stuff uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m06s)

[okay so let's go down to let's go down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m11s)

[to apply template right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m13s)

[uh and actually let's let's let's try](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m15s)

[that f1 trick again](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m18s)

[oh no dice no dice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m23s)

[uh we're gonna leave you up i'll leave](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m26s)

[you there for a moment close you close](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m29s)

[you close you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m31s)

[uh when ui 3 how about](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m32s)

[apply template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m36s)

[uh yeah template xaml controls](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m40s)

[that's kind of what we're after up above](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m43s)

[default style key oh this is kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m46s)

[what we wanted](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m49s)

[right because we wanted to do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m51s)

[i don't know if we did that up here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m55s)

[yeah so we we do want to set the default](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h34m58s)

[style key](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m01s)

[to be ripple i mean i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m03s)

[it clearly worked without it uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m06s)

[this goes in the constructor not the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m09s)

[static constructor so this whole static](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m12s)

[constructor goes away now i think we've](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m15s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m16s)

[all of those things okay so that goes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m17s)

[away](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m20s)

[i do wonder if we can get rid of this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m21s)

[pressed instances](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m23s)

[kind of curious why we need it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m25s)

[we might be able to get rid of it might](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m28s)

[even be able to get rid of it on the wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m30s)

[side too](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m31s)

[okay so let's see so there's that that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m32s)

[great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m36s)

[we do some of this stuff that's great on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m37s)

[label changed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m39s)

[that's fine okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m42s)

[um update the custom control file](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m46s)

[but how does one how does one get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m50s)

[access to those thingies](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m54s)

[there has to be a way to get access to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h35m57s)

[your](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m00s)

[templated elements](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m08s)

[i mean i assume so that would be a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m10s)

[heck of a miss if there if it wasn't um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m14s)

[so let's see here so what what is find](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m18s)

[name](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m20s)

[let's look at what find name claims to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m21s)

[do so let's just f1 that guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m23s)

[retrieves an object that has a special](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m26s)

[specified identifier name that's not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m28s)

[quite what i want um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m30s)

[how about we look up control template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m37s)

[okay you're not hitting anything so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m43s)

[let's just go to c](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m45s)

[con not showing up there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m47s)

[okay so let's go back over to our xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m50s)

[and if i go control template and i f1 on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m56s)

[that guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h36m58s)

[okay so you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m00s)

[wow the following example creates a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m06s)

[control template yada yada yada great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m08s)

[great uh xaml control templates](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m12s)

[uh which defines great](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m17s)

[uh the target type and the implicit xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m21s)

[content](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m27s)

[a control element must be a true control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m31s)

[subclass](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m33s)

[so then that's fine we can do that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m35s)

[control templates provide the visuals](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m45s)

[and parts that make up the control at](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m47s)

[runtime the template has already been](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m49s)

[applied so all the parts](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m51s)

[uh are now truly parts of the control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m53s)

[and be a as](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m55s)

[to examine the example name scopes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m56s)

[within the control content](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h37m59s)

[or using the visual tree helper class](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m00s)

[ah there are ways to access template](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m04s)

[defined contents](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m05s)

[either before or after the template is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m07s)

[applied](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m09s)

[see on a get template child that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m10s)

[that's the guy that's the guy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m14s)

[yeah that's okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m19s)

[okay that's that's what i want not find](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m22s)

[name i want something like get](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m25s)

[templated child right so that should be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m27s)

[a child from my template right that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m31s)

[choose the name element instantiated in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m35s)

[the control templates visual tree](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m37s)

[that's what i want okay rinse repeat try](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m40s)

[this again](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m43s)

[gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m46s)

[see there's there's nothing new under](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m52s)

[the sun there's this is all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m54s)

[just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m56s)

[all just the same with slightly](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h38m59s)

[different names](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m01s)

[boom so we come in here find me my scale](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m03s)

[transform](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m06s)

[look at that found my scale transform f5](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m07s)

[let the guy go right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m10s)

[and that also fixes the the speed](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m15s)

[problem right if i hold it down it goes](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m17s)

[nice and slow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m19s)

[if i go fast](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m20s)

[boom boom boom boom boom boom boom look](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m23s)

[at that feedback](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m26s)

[beautiful beautiful feedback love it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m28s)

[love it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m30s)

[love it love it love it okay so that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m31s)

[gives us](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m34s)

[ripple feedback uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m36s)

[okay so we've addressed we addressed the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m40s)

[speed as well](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m42s)

[what am i missing now i mean in terms of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m44s)

[a button there's not a lot left](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m48s)

[it's got a click oh we do have the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m50s)

[shadow and the elevation](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m52s)

[figure out how to do a shadow in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h39m59s)

[in win ui let's let's figure that out](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m02s)

[because that's kind of a big deal](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m04s)

[for the material design stuff they don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m07s)

[really have true](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m09s)

[shadows but they do have elevation which](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m10s)

[we implement in wpf as a shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m13s)

[with slightly different](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m16s)

[radiuses uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m19s)

[and i know we've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m24s)

[composition shadows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m28s)

[z depth and shadow well that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m32s)

[is exactly the physical world blah blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m36s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m39s)

[theme shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m44s)

[xyz coordinates](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m49s)

[yeah see this sounds better](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h40m53s)

[elevated to 32 pixels in each additional](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m01s)

[casting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m03s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m10s)

[oh so i literally just do this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m14s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m21s)

[so okay so theme shadows and pop-ups is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m26s)

[off](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m29s)

[in the case of your where the user needs](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m30s)

[attention to quickly grab it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m32s)

[blah blah blah create hierarchy](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m33s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m37s)

[shadow and other elements that's kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m43s)

[what we're going for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m46s)

[oh so there's literally just a straight](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m53s)

[shadow property on this thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h41m55s)

[shared shadow so we do a theme shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m00s)

[and then we just apply the sucker](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m05s)

[that seems too easy i am wondering if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m09s)

[oh so this is a little interesting so we](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m18s)

[we create a shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m20s)

[add the background grid as a shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m26s)

[receiver](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m28s)

[ah so you have to define what the shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m32s)

[is drawn onto](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m34s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m40s)

[and then you have to translate these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m46s)

[things in the appropriate direction](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m48s)

[oh that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m50s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m55s)

[the system sets a limit of five caster](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h42m59s)

[receiver pairs](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m01s)

[oh that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m10s)

[oh okay so okay so that's fine if](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m25s)

[so it's not that i can only have five](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m29s)

[elements](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m31s)

[but i can only have five shadows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m32s)

[or i guess that may the pair make sense](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m35s)

[right i can only have five shadows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m38s)

[casting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m39s)

[onto five up to five things at any given](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m40s)

[time](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m43s)

[that's fine we can have a single shadow](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m44s)

[i don't see an issue with that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h43m48s)

[cast the same type of shadow onto the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m00s)

[same receiver elements then add the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m02s)

[shadows](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m05s)

[oh drop shadow class](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m10s)

[it's not automatically responsive to its](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m13s)

[environment and does not use](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m15s)

[light sources oh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m16s)

[that could be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m20s)

[actually potentially better for us](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m23s)

[because this would line up a lot more](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m32s)

[yeah this would line up a lot more with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m38s)

[how our existing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m40s)

[shadow stuff works](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m42s)

[boy that's that's a tough call the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m51s)

[problem is is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m54s)

[with this other one here i think i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m55s)

[to understand the limitations of it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m57s)

[specifically these things here because](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h44m59s)

[if the library starts](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m02s)

[taking up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m04s)

[yeah if the library starts taking up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m10s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m14s)

[that is interesting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m21s)

[that is true](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m30s)

[yeah that is an interesting problem that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m48s)

[i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m51s)

[fully know how to solve](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h45m52s)

[i think going with the drop shadow is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m02s)

[probably better](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m05s)

[when it has animations and everything](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m10s)

[see we could do some really clever stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m12s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m15s)

[wpf you don't get to do this kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m16s)

[fanciness](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m24s)

[uh let's see so shadows are not clipped](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m31s)

[oh that is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m33s)

[excellent the only place where that's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m34s)

[going to be somewhat problematic in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m37s)

[um our library is the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m40s)

[uh color zone](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m43s)

[because our color zone we explicitly](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m48s)

[have an attached property that allows us](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m49s)

[to uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m51s)

[um to clip it off because occasionally](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m54s)

[you have areas where you put a color](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m57s)

[zone on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m58s)

[and you really want to only give the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h46m59s)

[effect of a shadow off one edge](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m02s)

[right so you might clip it down to say](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m04s)

[only to show off the bottom or the top](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m05s)

[edge](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m07s)

[for example just so you can give](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m08s)

[yourself that elevation](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m09s)

[i think i want to look at this the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m14s)

[problem is is this is also](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m17s)

[i'm also looking at my time realizing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m24s)

[that i am i am close to my](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m26s)

[my streaming limit and i and i cannot go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m28s)

[late tonight i've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m31s)

[other stuff that needs to happen so i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m32s)

[think i'm probably going to quit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m35s)

[here for tonight but this is this is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m37s)

[exciting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m39s)

[i i like this um there was a little bit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m41s)

[of effort in bringing stuff over](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m44s)

[but overall it was not terribly](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m46s)

[difficult to restyle a button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m49s)

[it really was not that hard to go](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m53s)

[between wpf](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m56s)

[and win ui and i was fairly happy with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h47m58s)

[the result that we got here oh the other](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m02s)

[thing i'm noticing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m05s)

[the click event isn't actually making it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m10s)

[to the button anymore because we're not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m12s)

[incrementing our counter](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m13s)

[oopsie so that's another bug](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m15s)

[that is another bug so i think i would](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m19s)

[i i'm really tempted so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m22s)

[if you are interested in material design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m26s)

[and xaml](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m29s)

[coming to win ui drop me a line either](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m29s)

[on twitter leave a comment on the video](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m32s)

[whatever um is this something that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m34s)

[that we should invest time in right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m40s)

[because porting a library to another](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m44s)

[framework is a big big lift](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m48s)

[right it is it is a big lift just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m51s)

[bringing in a one new control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m53s)

[not to mention going through and and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m55s)

[bringing in a whole suite of controls](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h48m57s)

[right because if we go back to our](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m00s)

[if we go back here i want to look at one](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m03s)

[more thing how big is this tool box](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m05s)

[how how big](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m09s)

[so zero that's easy then um that's that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m13s)

[is clearly not right we've we can see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m16s)

[that there's at least a button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m18s)

[how much is in here right so we've got](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m19s)

[all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m22s)

[at bar auto suggests box](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m23s)

[uh some of these don't matter calendar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m27s)

[date picker](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m29s)

[calendar panel wait they](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m30s)

[uh carousel panel i don't think we would](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m34s)

[need to do anything with i'm pretty sure](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m36s)

[that's just the layout control](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m37s)

[check box there's a color picker color](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m39s)

[picker slider](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m42s)

[spectrum combo box](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m44s)

[yeah so there's quite a bit in here and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m50s)

[i i guess i'd be curious](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m53s)

[too so if win ui is is something that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m55s)

[interests you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h49m59s)

[i guess my only ask would be what is a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m00s)

[what is a minimum viable product right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m03s)

[if if i said material design was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m06s)

[available for win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m09s)

[would every single control have to have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m10s)

[a template or is there some](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m12s)

[subset of controls that you're using](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m14s)

[that are the most important to you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m17s)

[yeah because some of these some of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m26s)

[are easy right some of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m27s)

[and like the the scroll bar and scroll](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m29s)

[viewer we didn't template those](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m31s)

[in wpf land for a very long time it was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m34s)

[only in the last couple releases that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m38s)

[those actually got done](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m39s)

[teaching tip is that the new name for](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m45s)

[tool tip i guess](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m48s)

[maybe i guess we'll see](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m50s)

[no there's tool tip i'm curious what](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m53s)

[teaching tip is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m56s)

[what is a teaching tip do you show to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h50m58s)

[show a picture](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m01s)

[pictures would be cool uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m03s)

[oh xaml control okay that's right](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m10s)

[so there is a app i forgot about this i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m14s)

[remember seeing this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m18s)

[and i think i even installed it if i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m19s)

[not mistaken or](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m21s)

[i put it on my listing xml controls](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m22s)

[library uh it's in the store](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m28s)

[let's go get it real quick gimme](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m34s)

[gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m38s)

[oh you're going to install stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m45s)

[you got updates to install i just want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m48s)

[this app](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m51s)

[install you own this app see i know i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m53s)

[done something maybe i downloaded on a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m57s)

[different machine](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h51m59s)

[so say i think i looked at this once](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m00s)

[once before and it was fairly nice to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m02s)

[able to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m04s)

[because i believe this comes from the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m05s)

[the same repo that the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m09s)

[new microsoft mvvm1 comes from so i was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m12s)

[interested in](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m16s)

[teaching tip show teaching tip](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m18s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m22s)

[it's kind of a fun fun little toast](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m25s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m29s)

[that's kind of cool and so it just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m42s)

[handles everything for you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m44s)

[huh that's a really nice little addition](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m47s)

[see and this is part of why i wanna why](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m54s)

[i'm interested in win ui is there's a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m56s)

[there's a lot of these kind of nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h52m58s)

[little interactions](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m00s)

[that uh are useful like some of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m03s)

[things like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m05s)

[like flip view right like this is nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m07s)

[but does it really need much of a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m09s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m11s)

[bent on it right i think there's i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m12s)

[there's an equivalent maybe around those](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m15s)

[little buttons or something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m16s)

[but like grid view there's no there's no](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m17s)

[theming there right it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m20s)

[it's a layout control i don't i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m22s)

[care](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m24s)

[pull to refresh i don't know how to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m25s)

[trigger this custom icon](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m29s)

[see i think i need a touch screen to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m35s)

[trigger some of these](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m37s)

[this machine is not a touch screen so](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m39s)

[yeah so there's layout stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m41s)

[radio buttons are in layout](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m45s)

[why are the radio buttons in layout that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m48s)

[is not what i would expect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m50s)

[that is interesting](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h53m58s)

[yeah why are radio buttons not next to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m02s)

[like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m04s)

[check boxes and similar or toggle](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m06s)

[switches](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m08s)

[um yeah so we may we may give this a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m10s)

[shot](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m14s)

[that's the other thing is it now it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m15s)

[doesn't play well with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m17s)

[um material design but this is one of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m19s)

[the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m22s)

[the cool things that you get in win ui](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m23s)

[that you cannot do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m25s)

[in wpf just with the way the render](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m27s)

[stack works](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m30s)

[is you can get this nice little acrylic](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m31s)

[brush and you can kind of fake this with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m34s)

[some sort of like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m36s)

[blur and transparency stuff but you](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m37s)

[can't get the same exact effect it's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m39s)

[it's just not possible right so you can](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m42s)

[see kind of](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m44s)

[what's back there so it's it's a very](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m46s)

[nice effect](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m49s)

[to be able to give a hint of what's back](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m50s)

[there to show things](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m52s)

[um and there's a there's some fun](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m54s)

[write-ups that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m56s)

[uh microsoft has put out on this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h54m58s)

[about how how they went about doing it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m01s)

[which like this is this is just nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m05s)

[right and it doesn't work with material](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m09s)

[design right the material design stuff](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m11s)

[does not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m13s)

[leverage this kind of blur transparency](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m13s)

[so cool i'm gonna keep that guy around](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m18s)

[we'll play with him later](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m21s)

[um i think i'm probably gonna wrap up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m23s)

[there i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m25s)

[like i said i think overall i would call](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m26s)

[this a](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m28s)

[a positive result right we got the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m30s)

[button](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m33s)

[we got the ripple let's hold on let's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m34s)

[let's just see if we can fix that hit](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m36s)

[test](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m37s)

[is hit test visible false](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m38s)

[right because i think that's what it was](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m42s)

[something like that that was similar](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m44s)

[in here right because we want it to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m46s)

[the canvas is hit test visible not the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m52s)

[renderer](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m55s)

[uh so ripple needs to be hit testable](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m57s)

[but the ripple theme itself](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h55m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m02s)

[content sits on top](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m12s)

[are you the problem](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m15s)

[i don't i don't know who's stealing the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m20s)

[oops let's launch this again i don't](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m23s)

[know who's stealing that click](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m26s)

[i'm actually not entirely sure how to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m30s)

[debug that either](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m31s)

[oh i left teaching tips sitting in there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m33s)

[i think this is a better way to see all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m37s)

[of the stuff that's in there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m39s)

[all controls and you can go through all](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m41s)

[that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m44s)

[it's actually kind of a nice layout i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m46s)

[wonder if maybe i should consider](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m48s)

[changing up the way the material design](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m50s)

[demo app is and get something a little](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m52s)

[little party](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m54s)

[so this is definitely triggering it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h56m59s)

[i wonder if it's the very fact that i'm](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m04s)

[handling the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m06s)

[the down right um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m07s)

[pointer press i wonder if this guy here](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m10s)

[needs to explicitly go with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m13s)

[oh probably i bet you i bet it's this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m16s)

[right he captures it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m19s)

[and therefore it doesn't keep going down](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m22s)

[i bet you that's the problem](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m26s)

[that's gonna be fun because we want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m29s)

[observe it but we don't want to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m33s)

[necessarily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m35s)

[handle it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m37s)

[yeah see there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m42s)

[catch 22 we want to observe the event](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m45s)

[but we don't want to necessarily](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m48s)

[handle it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m51s)

[right so that is a little little funky](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h57m56s)

[so one way or another something](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m01s)

[something needs to change there](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m03s)

[we need that let's see let's leave](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m06s)

[myself a comment because future kevin's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m08s)

[not going to remember this](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m10s)

[uh we need to capture to get the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m12s)

[uh pointer what was it what was it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m17s)

[called](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m20s)

[uh pointer released](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m21s)

[uh event](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m26s)

[but this also appears to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m31s)

[prevent the click](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m37s)

[from uh](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m40s)

[propagating up](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m44s)

[so there's that](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m49s)

[i wonder is there a way to say like](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h58m52s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m00s)

[oh i wonder if we can do this okay i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m02s)

[know i said i was done but i just i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m04s)

[hate quitting when there's when there's](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m06s)

[bugs i just want to end on a nice](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m08s)

[nice positive note](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m11s)

[just want to know i just have to know](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m18s)

[how it works](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m20s)

[okay so i go click click](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m22s)

[so that works but the handled flag does](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m25s)

[not seem to be](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m28s)

[right so it's already false and i set it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m33s)

[to false so that doesn't do](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m36s)

[that doesn't do a darn thing](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m38s)

[uh as agile](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=01h59m56s)

[boy i wish there was a way to just](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m00s)

[boy i wish there was a way to say i want](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m12s)

[to get this and get notified of it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m14s)

[but i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m17s)

[so i'm gonna quit and i'm not gonna](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m31s)

[fight with it](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m34s)

[but that is that is the next thing on](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m35s)

[the docket if i](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m37s)

[decide to go down this path is start to](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m39s)

[figure this out because again i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m41s)

[button is kind of the](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m43s)

[the quintessential starting point and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m45s)

[getting that ripple working](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m47s)

[but overall i think when ui is not](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m48s)

[not terribly difficult so if you have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m52s)

[experience with](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m54s)

[wpf or even better if you have](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m55s)

[experience with uwp](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m58s)

[xaml you should feel right at home and](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h00m59s)

[for the most part it is](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h01m02s)

[pretty easy to get started so i think](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h01m04s)

[with that i'm going](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h01m06s)

[to tell everybody happy coding thanks](https://youtu.be/z4o9bS6cbpM?t=02h01m08s)
