[hello everyone welcome back sorry for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m02s)

[the delayed start I found out on Monday](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m04s)

[that I was helping out with a vacation](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m06s)

[bible school at our church this week and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m08s)

[unfortunately it means that I get home a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m10s)

[little later than expected so I've got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m12s)

[my Mountain Dew I've got my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m16s)

[code and after a long day a little bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m19s)

[of coding sounds wonderful okay diving](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m22s)

[right on it so first things first this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m25s)

[there's a very important thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m28s)

[that right there version 510 has been](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m31s)

[released now uh with every release it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m35s)

[very clear to me that there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m38s)

[are uh issues that always crop up um so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m42s)

[for example the numeric up down doesn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m46s)

[line up with other controls yep not not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m48s)

[shocking that was we we kind of pushed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m51s)

[it out we also knew that the numeric up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m54s)

[down control doesn't have the same](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m56s)

[Styles as the other ones so yeah like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h00m58s)

[that I was aware of so there's a few of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m00s)

[those things um there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m02s)

[is uh let's see oh sweet I didn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m04s)

[realize he opened a PR for this oh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m08s)

[that's even better that's even better](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m10s)

[okay we were definitely looking at that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m13s)

[I didn't realize](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m15s)

[that this one here was the uh more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m16s)

[interesting one so Michael's been](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m19s)

[shooting some messages uh off in our](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m20s)

[maintainers chat um kind of discussing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m24s)

[this so I kind of have a a pretty good](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m26s)

[idea of uh what already in here but we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m28s)

[are going to tag this one up I believe](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m31s)

[and I want to double](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m35s)

[check oh good he did because he said he](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m36s)

[was going to go update the the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m38s)

[readme and start in on a docs thing so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m40s)

[uh I'm here and brought coffee and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m44s)

[Mountain Dew excellent Pikachu excellent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m46s)

[I have my Mountain Dew and on a very](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m49s)

[happy note my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m51s)

[uh well hopefully not sleepy after that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m54s)

[much caffeine uh I found out this week](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h01m57s)

[that my uh my brother landed a new job](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m00s)

[working for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m03s)

[Pepsi needless to say my first question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m05s)

[involved acquiring Mountain](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m08s)

[Dew what a shock what a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m11s)

[shock uh yeah it made it made me very](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m14s)

[happy he's like hang on I just got hired](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m18s)

[I'm like I know I know I know I'll be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m21s)

[patient for a little bit so um but uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m24s)

[one of the things that I've wanted to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m28s)

[for a while in this project and I've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m30s)

[looked at doing it and it's not it's not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m31s)

[as simple as I had thought every time is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m33s)

[rather than having the Wiki page which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m36s)

[is fine I would much rather move](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m38s)

[everything inside of the uh like a docs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m40s)

[folder inside of here instead because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m44s)

[then all of the the documentation stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m47s)

[can go through a standard pull request](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m49s)

[process because the wiki on GitHub is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m51s)

[fine but you only really have a couple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m53s)

[options you can either open it up and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m55s)

[let everyone edit it or you can lock it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m57s)

[down and only let maintainers edit it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h02m59s)

[it's kind of a git repo like you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m02s)

[clone it right like if I move my if I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m04s)

[move my head over here oh is it thank](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m08s)

[you let me adjust it it is probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m10s)

[related because I have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m13s)

[my dial that down just a little bit see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m15s)

[if that corrects](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m18s)

[up the I have a an inwall AC](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m20s)

[unit I should probably just see if I can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m25s)

[turn it down for a moment](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m28s)

[my my limiter cuts out to try to keep](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m30s)

[the background audio from showing up but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m34s)

[see if I can remember how to do this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m38s)

[helped a bit good yeah I I dialed it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m42s)

[down on my board but I think part of it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m45s)

[is every time I talk my limiter triggers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m47s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m50s)

[my you also pick up the background noise](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m51s)

[from my AC unit why is this thing not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h03m54s)

[that's fine it's what I want but I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m02s)

[to sorry I'm trying to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m06s)

[work this thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m09s)

[again so you know what if I do that then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m11s)

[it'll just turn](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m14s)

[off how do I I think I just have to let](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m19s)

[it sit to get it to to accept the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m21s)

[changes there we go there we go that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m24s)

[will probably help dial out a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m27s)

[more let me know if that gets better for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m29s)

[you pinkachu um but I'd love to move the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m30s)

[Wiki page underneath a docs folder at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m33s)

[some point that way it can go through a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m35s)

[standard like poll request review](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m37s)

[process and it's a little bit easier um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m39s)

[because I have and I should probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m43s)

[change the footer uh I have in the past](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m45s)

[just left it wide open for people to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m47s)

[able to contribute which is fine but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m49s)

[then we started to get some bad](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m52s)

[contributions and I had to revert](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m54s)

[commits and it kind of got to be a pain](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m56s)

[so I locked it back down again it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h04m58s)

[like I don't know I don't know I throw](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m00s)

[it around but as part of that um I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m03s)

[mentioned it to Michael and he started](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m07s)

[down the path of well okay if I'm going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m08s)

[to write something new rather than](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m10s)

[putting it in the wiki I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m12s)

[through](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m13s)

[and uh just start in on on making a nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m15s)

[dox one which I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m18s)

[appreciate I appreciate um okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m20s)

[couple things we're going to look at so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m24s)

[how to increase rendering performance he](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m26s)

[referenced docs he added an FAQ great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m29s)

[that part looks good uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m32s)

[so home and this is one of the things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m35s)

[that you lose when you go away from a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m37s)

[Wiki page is you no longer have a nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m39s)

[I'm G to move myself over since this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m42s)

[net new uh you no longer have a nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m43s)

[kind of navigation bar on the um the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m46s)

[right hand side I realize I say right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m50s)

[hand side my camera's inverted so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m51s)

[rightand](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m53s)

[side and so you end up having to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m55s)

[something kind of like this to to do oh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h05m57s)

[good I'm glad yeah I think it's my my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m00s)

[Nall AC unit at some point I need to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m02s)

[figure out a way to cool my my office](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m04s)

[down without it because in the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m08s)

[summertime it gets warm in here um okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m10s)

[so a couple minor things I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m12s)

[for Microsoft learn links you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m14s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m18s)

[drop the language portion of it uh so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m19s)

[for example if I take this link now](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m22s)

[without the language part of it and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m24s)

[just drop it in a new tab](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m26s)

[right thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m30s)

[thinking come on Microsoft don't make a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m32s)

[liar out of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m35s)

[me if it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m38s)

[loads come on there we go you'll note it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m41s)

[then uses the the user's browser local](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m44s)

[to to appropriately populate it so if we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m47s)

[leave the link as is it'll have enus but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m50s)

[if I drop that uh it'll then default to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m54s)

[whatever language the user browser in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m57s)

[assuming Microsoft supports it so in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h06m59s)

[general I try to strip Language stuff um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m01s)

[out of my Microsoft](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m04s)

[links uh simply because then it makes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m07s)

[for a little bit nicer experience for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m10s)

[people whose first language is in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m11s)

[English mildly better like I realize the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m13s)

[text of the link is still written in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m16s)

[English and whatnot but it's like you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m17s)

[know what if I can default their browser](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m18s)

[to a a better uh situation why](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m20s)

[not um I am](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m24s)

[I am curious about oh the okay never](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m30s)

[mind I see I was seeing the um Chevron](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m33s)

[at the beginning of the line and being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m36s)

[very confused let me make that a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m38s)

[bigger for people um but I realized this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m40s)

[is using the what is the quote](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m43s)

[indent I think is what it's called in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m46s)

[the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m48s)

[markdown okay go there default value is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m50s)

[null makes the controls sharp and crisp](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m55s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h07m58s)

[okay so ultimately the short version of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m02s)

[this um issue is that the UI element](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m04s)

[cach mode the material design Library](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m07s)

[had added a shadow assist cach mode I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m10s)

[think and this is difficult to remember](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m13s)

[because some of this predates me um is I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m15s)

[think this was added a while back when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m19s)

[the the Shadows were added but and I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m21s)

[surprised this is still called Shadow](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m26s)

[assist maybe we should check that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m28s)

[because I thought we renamed Shadow](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m30s)

[assist to Elevation](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m32s)

[assist but clearly not because that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m34s)

[there I I'm surprised it's still called](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m39s)

[Shadow for one so that that that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m41s)

[potentially a rename that we might want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m44s)

[to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m46s)

[consider um but the the idea here is you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m48s)

[can cash the rendered UI element as a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m51s)

[bit map which can significantly improve](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m54s)

[rendering performance but the moment you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h08m58s)

[cache something as a bit map bit Maps um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m00s)

[are if you think of uh pixels drawn on a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m04s)

[screen and each pixel just has a fixed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m09s)

[RGB value there's kind of only so much](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m10s)

[you can do with that um and so if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m13s)

[have like some fancy animations or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m16s)

[similar like you can start to squeeze](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m17s)

[out a little bit more performance out of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m19s)

[some of your WPF controls but it does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m22s)

[often come at the cost of things not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m25s)

[always looking as sharp and as crisp as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m27s)

[they otherwise could be so with that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m29s)

[said use it uh sparingly and as you need](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m33s)

[to and part of the issue here was that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m37s)

[we had done a fix on several controls](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m40s)

[but not was it tool button or toggle](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m42s)

[button toolbar um and that that ended up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m45s)

[causing uh or I should say recused a bug](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m49s)

[that we had fixed on several other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m52s)

[controls so U Michael had proposed a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m53s)

[changing of our default value to make it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m57s)

[more in line with the default WPF](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h09m59s)

[Behavior which I think is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m01s)

[great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m04s)

[um yeah so and then this render it scale](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m07s)

[um there's a a fancy word here called](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m12s)

[rization it's where you take](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m15s)

[so with uh if you imagine drawing a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m19s)

[circle right uh in a bit map you might](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m23s)

[just record which pixels are which color](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m26s)

[to draw that Circle the problem is is as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m29s)

[you uh zoom in or zoom out of that bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m32s)

[map it starts to look better or worse](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m35s)

[depending on what on uh how many pixels](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m37s)

[you have and what they're what they're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m40s)

[rendered at because if you render a high](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m42s)

[number of pixels when you when you zoom](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m43s)

[way out there there has to be a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m46s)

[condensing of what used to be a big](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m49s)

[number of pixels into a small number of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m51s)

[pixels and we have to figure out how](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m52s)

[that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m54s)

[works a a better way of rendering and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m55s)

[this is how like svgs work is they don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h10m57s)

[record the value of pixels they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m00s)

[basically record the uh algorithm or if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m02s)

[you're familiar with like geometry they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m05s)

[record the equation of the circle and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m07s)

[then can use that to render the right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m09s)

[pixels at whatever size you want so it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m11s)

[doesn't matter how far in or out you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m14s)

[zoom it just uses that same equation to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m16s)

[to go through and do it yeah curves](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m19s)

[exactly and so it gives a much cleaner](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m20s)

[look the problem is once you do a bitmap](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m24s)

[cache what you're saying is I would like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m26s)

[to throw away that equation and I would](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m28s)

[like to cach a set number of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m30s)

[pixels because if you're just going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m33s)

[render the same thing every time just a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m35s)

[bit map is faster but if you start](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m37s)

[scaling things and doing things like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m39s)

[that now you can kind of end up losing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m41s)

[stuff so there is a when using things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m44s)

[like a bitmap cache you it's not just a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m47s)

[feature that you blindly turn on for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m50s)

[everything it's a feature that you turn](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m52s)

[on when needed as appropriate right and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m54s)

[it's on a Case by case spaces uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h11m58s)

[see increase render at scale will](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m00s)

[sharpen the control but also makes it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m02s)

[pixel with drawn](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m03s)

[smaller uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m05s)

[see see toolkit provides you with an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m08s)

[attached property Shadow says cash mode](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m11s)

[yay uh and the the big Advantage here is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m17s)

[our attached property allows for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m21s)

[inheritance so in some cases uh and and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m24s)

[everybody who works with WPF sort of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m28s)

[intrinsically understands the idea of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m30s)

[inherited properties but they don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m32s)

[realize](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m34s)

[it uh for example uh if you were to set](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m35s)

[like the background color of something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m39s)

[in WPF you expect that to only apply to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m41s)

[the one element that you set the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m44s)

[background color on which is how it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m45s)

[works which is great right but there are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m47s)

[other properties like font family or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m50s)

[font size that are actually inherited so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m53s)

[often times we'll set our our font](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m56s)

[family and font size at our window level](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h12m58s)

[and we expect that to apply to all of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m01s)

[our text elements inside the window that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m04s)

[would be an example of an uh a property](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m07s)

[where inheritance applies the default uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m09s)

[UI element cach mode is not inherited](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m12s)

[but our attached property in the library](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m14s)

[is this means that we can allow people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m16s)

[to set the attached property at like the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m19s)

[top level control button for example or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m22s)

[in this case toolbar and have it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m25s)

[propagate into the elements inside of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m28s)

[that and inside of our control templates](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m30s)

[apply it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m32s)

[appropriately yeah and he goes into a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m36s)

[nice example here of showing how this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m38s)

[all gets set](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m41s)

[up no the default value of Shadow assist](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m43s)

[cache mode is n didn't we just say that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m46s)

[above oh no this was UI element cach](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m50s)

[mode this is Shadow assist cach mode](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m53s)

[okay good good good good uh B bum we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m55s)

[have a couple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h13m59s)

[images let's just look at these real](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m01s)

[quick Copy there's actually an I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m03s)

[tempted do I say this or do I not say](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m06s)

[this I'll say it anyway um there is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m08s)

[what some people will call a security](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m13s)

[issue with GitHub is that you'll note](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m14s)

[this is a PR that hasn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m17s)

[merged right and this asset was uploaded](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m20s)

[underneath this repository without my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m25s)

[permission anyone can do this you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m27s)

[open up a PR against any any repo that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m30s)

[public you can open a PR drag an image](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m33s)

[up onto it to attach it to the pr and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m36s)

[GitHub will upload it and store it in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m40s)

[this assets and it will exist and you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m42s)

[can't delete](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m45s)

[it so it can be kind so some people have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m46s)

[discovered this and use it for malicious](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m51s)

[purposes don't do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m52s)

[that with great power comes great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h14m57s)

[responsibility yeah so there is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m00s)

[beautiful example I don't know how how](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m02s)

[clear that is to people but if we do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m04s)

[this and this one of these is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m07s)

[significantly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m10s)

[clear yeah well it is it is very scary](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m12s)

[Pikachu because the people who were](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m15s)

[doing it were using it to push out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m17s)

[malware and they were basically able to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m18s)

[make the the link for it looks more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m22s)

[legit because it's coming from GitHub](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m25s)

[become because it's coming from trusted](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m26s)

[you know I I think it was one of the mpm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m29s)

[repositories or something it's coming](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m31s)

[from a well-known repository it's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m33s)

[legit thing it's like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m35s)

[yeah that's the first part of the URL](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m37s)

[but yeah so I think the there was a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m40s)

[whole big long like Twitter argument](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m45s)

[over it um and a lot of it centered](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m48s)

[around the discussion of how and when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m51s)

[should these things be taken down and in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m53s)

[this particular case once it was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m55s)

[detected as malware like GitHub took it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m57s)

[down because it was like yeah we don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h15m59s)

[want to be hosting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m01s)

[malware fine but then people started](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m03s)

[finding other examples of well why isn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m05s)

[this taken down why isn't this T and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m07s)

[it's it becomes a bit of a chicken in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m09s)

[the egg chasing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m12s)

[uh chasing down the the bad stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m15s)

[because that is fairly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m19s)

[difficult let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m22s)

[uh and look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m25s)

[this my Michael you did amazing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m27s)

[work we were kind of joking with uh him](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m31s)

[on the maintainer chat we're like you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m35s)

[know at this point Michael you might be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m36s)

[our foremost expert on this topic](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m38s)

[because you spent significantly more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m41s)

[like this is a great example of how](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m44s)

[simple a change can be right it was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m47s)

[bitmap cash and now it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m50s)

[null that's the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m53s)

[change click](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m57s)

[uh let's look at what needed to happen](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h16m59s)

[in toolbar I think it was just a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m00s)

[application of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m02s)

[it yeah so in this case this change here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m04s)

[from having a built-in cache mode to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m08s)

[having it be controlled by the attached](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m10s)

[property is the sum total of it right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m14s)

[that's that's that's the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m17s)

[deal that's the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m19s)

[deal okay I heard](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m22s)

[approve hm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m27s)

[I'm going to hit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m29s)

[approve and then I think what we're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m31s)

[going to do that's a little big for me D](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m34s)

[that down see there's all of that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m37s)

[know what rather than waiting for him to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m40s)

[do this we're just going to commit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m43s)

[change right and we're going to commit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m48s)

[change and we're going it feels wrong to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m52s)

[make a suggestion and then commit your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m54s)

[own suggestion but the alternative is I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m56s)

[open up the the pr and do it myself](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h17m59s)

[we're just going to commit the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m02s)

[changes I think is this actually going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m05s)

[to do I think it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m07s)

[made okay that made a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m10s)

[commits didn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m12s)

[it yeah that's that's exciting that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m15s)

[did all of those kickoff builds yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m18s)

[they all kicked off builds okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m20s)

[cancel we don't need every single one of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m24s)

[you running not for a text](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m26s)

[change cancel cancel cancel that that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m31s)

[okay maybe I should have opened the pr](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m35s)

[and just pushed one commit that would](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m37s)

[have been smarter okay we're going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m39s)

[out this numeric control one this one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m45s)

[excites me uh let's see first of all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m47s)

[nice work](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m51s)

[um let's see regarding your comment](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m54s)

[we so let's see should we use increase](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h18m57s)

[uh content and decrease content or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m00s)

[and use the predefined as in time picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m04s)

[if we ignore or both properties we have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m07s)

[merging](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m11s)

[um let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m12s)

[yeah let's let's take a look at what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m33s)

[this is because the intent with the up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m35s)

[down buttons would be that they are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m36s)

[treated like other WPF content things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m38s)

[and are able](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m42s)

[to just go up and down as needed but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m44s)

[we'll take a look at the actual changes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m47s)

[so let's see here so new column new text](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m48s)

[block and this is in the fields lineup](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m53s)

[so this screenshot here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h19m56s)

[um of all of the so this is a page that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m00s)

[Nikolai added to the demo app basically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m03s)

[just uh putting all of these common kind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m06s)

[of form Fields together on a single](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m09s)

[place uh and rendering them next to each](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m12s)

[other so it's really really obvious when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m15s)

[something isn't there so the fact that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m18s)

[he went through and added all these I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m21s)

[think is great right this is this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m23s)

[really good work okay at least the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m26s)

[images look like really good work so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m29s)

[that's that's perfect okay so we did a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m31s)

[header](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m34s)

[great and then we did numeric up down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m35s)

[default numeric up down floating hint](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m38s)

[filled and outline which are the each of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m42s)

[the individual rows so asah great great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m45s)

[great great uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m48s)

[see what is this this is in a Handler of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m51s)

[some kind set](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m54s)

[value value goes to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h20m57s)

[zero oh this must just be used for the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m03s)

[initial value setting okay that's fine](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m05s)

[that's just demo app stuff okay and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m09s)

[oh oh he even updated the material](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m12s)

[design 3 demo app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m13s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m16s)

[that's excellent excellent work let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m17s)

[see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m21s)

[um so I don't mind this rename though I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m22s)

[am questioning if this constant should](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m26s)

[be renamed to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m29s)

[be like if we're going to drop the text](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m30s)

[box field from here which I think is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m33s)

[good I think we should probably drop it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m35s)

[from the constant name tube so we'll](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m36s)

[leave that one open for a minute because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m38s)

[I want to check usage uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m40s)

[so we dropped a unus name space that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m42s)

[fine wh space cleanup that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m46s)

[fine let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m49s)

[and we have style numeric up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m52s)

[down oh wow we didn't even have this in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m56s)

[the boy I screwed that up the generic.](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h21m59s)

[examle didn't have it added okay so that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m02s)

[was a mistake on my part oh the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m05s)

[namespace that was dropped was it a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m07s)

[dupe oh it is a dupe look at that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m10s)

[so unlike C where we just do a using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m15s)

[statement and then the name space at the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m18s)

[top in zaml name spaces have names so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m19s)

[for example this XML namespace is named](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m23s)

[local and it is pointed at the CLR](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m26s)

[namespace materialdesign themes.](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m28s)

[WPF this XML namespace is named WPF and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m31s)

[it's pointed at the CLR namespace](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m35s)

[materialdesign themes. WPF so this is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m37s)

[straight dupe of this no not what I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m39s)

[wanted bad co-pilot go away so that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m43s)

[fine that's just cleaning up my mistake](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m46s)

[so I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m48s)

[accept let's see and then this is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m50s)

[material design 2 defaults pulls that in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m53s)

[oh because it was oh it wasn't even in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m55s)

[the default](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h22m58s)

[boy that was that was really dumb of me](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m00s)

[okay here's the big guy and we will](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m03s)

[probably go check this thing out here in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m05s)

[a minute in fact this might be easier to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m07s)

[review this might be um yeah and this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m12s)

[guy here is just the UI test failing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m17s)

[let's go check this sucker out and let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m20s)

[CU I don't want to review this diff that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m22s)

[high up and I think if we fix that the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m25s)

[constant change that'll probably fix](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m28s)

[this one okay so uh everybody favor get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m30s)

[Kracken in fact we might even do some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m35s)

[Cloud patch stuff here in a little bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m37s)

[because we need to do some Cloud patch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m40s)

[stuff um there is a strong desire to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m42s)

[have more get Kraken](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m47s)

[content so sorry what am I doing here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m50s)

[align numeric up down so I would like to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m53s)

[add remote and check out branch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m56s)

[that is the magical incantation that I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h23m59s)

[would](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m01s)

[like great and now I would like to open](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m02s)

[up TI design toolkit I will say so I run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m05s)

[Visual Studio preview builds and like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m08s)

[98% of the time or so they're pretty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m12s)

[good like occasionally I see some small](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m15s)

[bugs but they aren't like like they're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m18s)

[annoying but they aren't you know stop](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m21s)

[using it type](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m25s)

[situation um I did run into a bug with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m27s)

[last week's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m29s)

[release that actually caused me to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m32s)

[install regular Visual Studio I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m35s)

[see it happening here but I ran into a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m37s)

[problem where um Visual Studio was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m39s)

[throwing a no reference exception when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m43s)

[attempting to load some projects and it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m44s)

[didn't make sense to me like which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m47s)

[projects they were it would consistently](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m49s)

[pick on the same set of projects in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m51s)

[solution but it didn't like the ones](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m54s)

[that it picked seem arbitrary I'm like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m56s)

[don't understand why it's failing on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m58s)

[this test project but not this one like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h24m59s)

[it was weird but I reported it and as of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m02s)

[yesterday they marked the fix as pending](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m06s)

[release so huzzah so for reference this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m09s)

[is worth noting if you run into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m14s)

[something in Visual Studio that isn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m15s)

[working there's a little there's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m17s)

[little itty bitty little itty bitty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m19s)

[whoop this guy right here right that guy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m23s)

[if you click this you can hit report](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m27s)

[problem or suggest feature like and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m30s)

[these actually get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m32s)

[handled especially if you spend the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m34s)

[effort to like type up a decent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m37s)

[description and whatnot of what the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m38s)

[issue is like they actually use these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m40s)

[for stuff it's wonderful absolutely](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m43s)

[wonderful so for for what it is worth](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m49s)

[definitely definitely leverage](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m51s)

[those okay let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m54s)

[I already forgot where I was going I got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h25m59s)

[distracted uh let's see numeric upd](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m01s)

[down. SLE that's where we want to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m03s)

[so numeric upd down. zaml not the demo](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m06s)

[app I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m10s)

[the where is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m12s)

[my not the ma apps](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m22s)

[one this one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m26s)

[okay right this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m32s)

[the this is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m35s)

[one yeah and there was the question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m37s)

[around specifically the content so I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m41s)

[assume these ones here now the one thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m46s)

[I'm noticing right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m48s)

[away I'm hesitant to leave these at as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m54s)

[they are because what this will do is if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h26m58s)

[anyone references this resource](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m00s)

[dictionary content increase and content](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m02s)

[decrease now show up when they use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m04s)

[static resource in their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m06s)

[app but they yeah so at minimum I think](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m09s)

[I want to change this name to like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m13s)

[material design numeric up down content](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m15s)

[increase or something of that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m18s)

[nature oh these are only used in those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m20s)

[places](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m23s)

[yeah trying to remember what the X Shar](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m30s)

[does why why am I blanking on this hang](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m32s)

[on X shared WPF I'm trying](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m38s)

[to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m47s)

[sometimes sometimes okay remind me when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m48s)

[set to false so that request for the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m53s)

[create a new instance instead of sharing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m56s)

[the same instance right okay so it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h27m58s)

[changes it from Singleton to to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m01s)

[transient basically in the references](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m03s)

[but I still don't like these things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m06s)

[effectively being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m09s)

[public uh let's do this so uh control KK](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m12s)

[puts in a bookmark you can see my little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m17s)

[bookmark bar up here is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m19s)

[now what is it is it control shift yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m24s)

[control shift does my arrows okay I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m28s)

[trying to I'm trying to learn the arrow](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m30s)

[keys](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m31s)

[so that guy there so if you control KK](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m33s)

[we'll leave a bookmark and then we can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m37s)

[jump between these and I'll often use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m39s)

[these as ways of uh just being able to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m40s)

[reference things that I want to go back](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m44s)

[to nesting things inside of a Styles](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m46s)

[resources like a very simple thing right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m48s)

[here would also be to do this these are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m50s)

[still get resolved because they're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m53s)

[inside the same style but they're no](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m55s)

[longer public outside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m57s)

[so possibly useful right but I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h28m59s)

[curious why we would leave these here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m03s)

[versus just straight in line the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m05s)

[values because these are just style](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m07s)

[Setters I think I think we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m11s)

[might I I I don't understand why I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m14s)

[wouldn't do that but we'll see let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m17s)

[so nested text box nested numeric up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m19s)

[down style](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m21s)

[great um I am surprised](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m23s)

[I guess this does make sense I was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m29s)

[surprised to see both style resources](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m31s)

[and control template resources](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m33s)

[oftentimes we flatten those because it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m35s)

[not a huge difference either way but it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m38s)

[it does slightly matter for when people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m40s)

[base their style off of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m42s)

[something okay that seems fine this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m49s)

[probably a big portion of making sure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m54s)

[like yeah that's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h29m58s)

[lot I'm just kind of briefly going to go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m02s)

[through these making sure they line up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m05s)

[because it's very easy when doing these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m08s)

[to accidentally get one that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m10s)

[brush text field set is Mouse over ah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m25s)

[clever okay priority binding there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m29s)

[something you don't see very](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m33s)

[much the priority bindings uh walk](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m38s)

[through a list of bindings um and they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m42s)

[they will use whichever binding first](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m45s)

[produces a value in the list so they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m47s)

[basically say first second third and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m49s)

[they they're kind of like a budget if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m51s)

[else's all the way through only in zaml](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m52s)

[binding syntax so let me see if I can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m55s)

[remember the rules with a priority](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h30m58s)

[binding if the binding produces uh like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m00s)

[unset due to like the source missing or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m03s)

[similar it'll fall through I believe](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m06s)

[it'll fall through on nolles if I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m08s)

[remember right looking for the first](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m10s)

[thing that actually produces the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m12s)

[value I always have to double check it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m14s)

[because they aren't something that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m16s)

[used super](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m18s)

[often but this is basically just being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m20s)

[able to look at the outside and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m23s)

[fall back to um something relative so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m25s)

[this is allowing the the time picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m29s)

[assist I am curious](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m31s)

[here I'm not sure we should use time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m35s)

[picker assist on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m38s)

[this I'm going to mark this too time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m42s)

[picker assist is something that I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m45s)

[would I'd be hesitant to use it outside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m49s)

[of a Time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m51s)

[picker so little hesitant there I I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m55s)

[more tempted to make a specific one for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h31m59s)

[this um just from a naming perspective](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m01s)

[it it gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m04s)

[weird often times we tell people if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m05s)

[there's go attached properties are not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m08s)

[discoverable in WPF you have to know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m11s)

[they're there and know to use them so in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m13s)

[an effort to try to mitigate that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m16s)

[discoverability problem we often tell](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m18s)

[people hey it's the control name with a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m20s)

[cyst on the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m22s)

[end that's the attached properties that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m24s)

[we've got available for this control](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m26s)

[that's usually the guiding principle](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m28s)

[because then it makes it a little bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m30s)

[easier uh let's see and then this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m33s)

[just using template bindings up to the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m35s)

[Setters that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m38s)

[one and this looks pretty good I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m52s)

[see anything here a lot of this lines up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m57s)

[with what we've done on other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h32m58s)

[styles uh let's see and then we've got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m01s)

[some curious why we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m05s)

[have I'm just looking at this I see so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m09s)

[we've got all these properties here then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m13s)

[we've got the attached](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m14s)

[properties and alphabetical ones here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m16s)

[because we go template down to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m18s)

[here handles clear command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m22s)

[turn clear text handles clear command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m28s)

[why am I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m31s)

[not what does this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m37s)

[do the problem with this is this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m44s)

[being set to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m47s)

[true but the so this is another weird](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m49s)

[thing with attached properties is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m52s)

[because attached properties don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m53s)

[necessarily have to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m56s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h33m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m00s)

[uh to do anything they can just hold](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m02s)

[data they don't have to like modify](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m06s)

[anything in particular however attached](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m08s)

[properties can have this onchanged](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m11s)

[Handler call back and they can do stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m14s)

[like add command bindings that's a thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m17s)

[right you can start mucking with the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m20s)

[control and so there's a bit of back and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m22s)

[forth about what what and how you should](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m24s)

[use attached properties some people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m27s)

[really love doing them like this because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m29s)

[it gives you a nice easy way to sort of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m32s)

[attach extra Behavior to them some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m34s)

[people would argue WPF behaviors are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m36s)

[better um I think attached properties in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m38s)

[general should somewhat steer away from](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m42s)

[changing Behavior but sometimes it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m45s)

[kind of unavoidable or it's the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m48s)

[easiest way to get something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m50s)

[done so I usually go with the idea of if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m53s)

[it's obvious that there's Behavior it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h34m57s)

[fine if there's if it's not obvious](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m00s)

[there's Behavior it's not fine okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m02s)

[these this actually works because this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m05s)

[is well this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m08s)

[here on this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m11s)

[control but is it forwarded](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m15s)

[down I don't think it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m19s)

[is I don't think this is forwarded down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m23s)

[anywhere](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m26s)

[so setting this thing here isn't going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m28s)

[to do anything is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m30s)

[it because the attached property is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m32s)

[going to be set to true on new value](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m34s)

[true it'll add a command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m37s)

[binding which is fine so the command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m39s)

[binding will get added but when the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m41s)

[command is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m44s)

[invoked oh I guess the command is going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m49s)

[to come up from the text box so it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m52s)

[should land here we should test this I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m54s)

[believe that's the intent is it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m56s)

[expected to land](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h35m58s)

[here because the that guy will raise the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m00s)

[event I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m06s)

[believe yeah well I'll leave a bookmark](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m11s)

[we'll come back and check it okay and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m14s)

[then we have the the floating hint which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m16s)

[is going to be the exact same thing with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m19s)

[a slight style change for the nested](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m22s)

[textbox style I kind of like this is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m25s)

[clever trick](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m27s)

[so you'll note the this is the base](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m30s)

[style and it kind of has everything and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m33s)

[you'll note it has this nested text box](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m35s)

[style right and if we go here and we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m38s)

[hunt the usages of this guy you'll note](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m42s)

[this is something that I usually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m45s)

[discourage is I will tell people that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m48s)

[you should uh rarely use Dynamic](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m51s)

[resource unless something's going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m54s)

[change at runtime if it's going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m56s)

[change it comp uh at compile time use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h36m57s)

[static](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m00s)

[resource and so what's happening here is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m01s)

[because this is a dynamic](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m06s)

[resource that will go and look up the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m09s)

[appropriate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m12s)

[style and this guy then gets to sneak in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m14s)

[and over and effectively override the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m17s)

[one that's here generally you don't do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m19s)

[Dynamic resource on a style Target in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m22s)

[this case it's kind of clever because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m25s)

[otherwise you then run into the question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m27s)

[of well how do I how do I manipulate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m29s)

[something on a nested element without](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m31s)

[just duplicating the entire control so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m34s)

[and I think Nikolai may have done this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m38s)

[on some of the other textbox work that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m40s)

[he was doing I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m42s)

[think maybe we double check yeah so it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m44s)

[means that the floating hint version of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m49s)

[this is basically the exact same as this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m51s)

[one with the only change being well I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m54s)

[going to swap out this style and because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h37m57s)

[it happens to have the same key as the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m00s)

[one used in the base one it gets picked](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m02s)

[up so it's dirty trick and then it it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m04s)

[changes a couple Setters so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m08s)

[huzzah uh fi looks to be the same exact](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m10s)

[thing same style trick which is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m14s)

[great uh toggles up the the background](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m17s)

[and the padding which makes sense for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m20s)

[the field style which is kind of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m22s)

[solid color background there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m24s)

[and then the outline once again kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m27s)

[the same thing just toggling](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m29s)

[those okay so all of that looks good](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m32s)

[let's fire the demo up and take a look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m34s)

[at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m37s)

[it Love Me Some Mountain](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m43s)

[Dew](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m53s)

[okay let's get this guy going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m55s)

[okay and so this is going to be Fields](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h38m59s)

[lineup actually you know what let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m01s)

[let's cheat I want to show something off](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m03s)

[here real quick so under the demo app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m05s)

[and this is something that I think a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m07s)

[of people don't realize it's very common](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m09s)

[in ASP net core developers to know this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m11s)

[but sometimes thick client developers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m13s)

[don't realize you can manipulate your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m15s)

[launch settings. Json right the fact](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m17s)

[that this thing says demo app up here it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m20s)

[it only says demo app next to my play](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m22s)

[button because it says demo app in my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m24s)

[launch settings Json and more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m26s)

[importantly you can use these launch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m29s)

[profiles to set up like different](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m32s)

[command line arguments you can use these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m34s)

[to set up different environment](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m36s)

[variables um there's a handful of things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m38s)

[right so if I wanted to change this no](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m42s)

[and say under under this demo app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m44s)

[profile I want this environment variable](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m47s)

[but there's nothing stopping me from](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m50s)

[making multiple profiles either because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m51s)

[sometimes you want to launch in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m54s)

[different things so demo app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m55s)

[Kevin right so I could I could even go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h39m58s)

[as far as to do something like Fields](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m00s)

[line up right and then rather than this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m03s)

[being the homepage this would be what's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m06s)

[change what it's going to launch to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m30s)

[whatever I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m32s)

[want now I clearly got that one wrong](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m34s)

[supposed to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m38s)

[so what is and and maybe it's worth](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m39s)

[bacing launch profiles see where's our](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m43s)

[command line parse command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m45s)

[line right so what is what is startup](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m47s)

[page get parsed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m50s)

[as oh this is using old system command](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m53s)

[line I should update it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m56s)

[let's see so this pulls Back start page](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m58s)

[just as a string which is great where](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h40m59s)

[startup page goes here and it wants to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m12s)

[find the first one where the name](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m16s)

[matches oh so I probably need to do the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m17s)

[name of this is probably going to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m21s)

[Fields line up with spaces I bet color](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m22s)

[so close that close that and then if we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m42s)

[go back to our launch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m45s)

[settings and then this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m47s)

[little awkward because we need to escape](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m49s)

[our](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h41m51s)

[control okay so this is the floating](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m17s)

[hint this is obviously](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m20s)

[none](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m23s)

[and uh this is the fill](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m25s)

[background now I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m29s)

[curious how does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m32s)

[that you could use humanizer to generate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m35s)

[those names yeah that's a good point and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m37s)

[for the demo app that's not a bad](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m39s)

[idea honestly like the the library we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m41s)

[try to avoid taking any fun extra](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m45s)

[dependencies but for the demo app we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m47s)

[it's usually nice to kind of show stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m49s)

[off I also warn people that you should](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m50s)

[not copy code from the demo app blindly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m53s)

[because the demo app shows off the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m57s)

[breadth of what is possible and in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h42m59s)

[general your app shouldn't leverage](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m01s)

[everything like we show off both code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m03s)

[behind and mvvm style patterns you you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m06s)

[probably want to favor one in your app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m10s)

[and not just use both so there's there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m12s)

[a little bit of that where it's hey you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m14s)

[probably want to pick on one of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m17s)

[and not the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m19s)

[other okay um I am curious because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m23s)

[thought I I wanted to see that clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m27s)

[text let me grab this here because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m30s)

[think it's Escape is it supposed to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m32s)

[the key for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m34s)

[it what is the clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m36s)

[Tech okay I want to look at where](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m40s)

[this I want to look at clear so clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m43s)

[text uh clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m49s)

[command let's take a look so Auto](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m52s)

[suggest box password box](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m55s)

[yeah so this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h43m58s)

[guy the problem is is in order to get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m10s)

[this guy to show](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m13s)

[up I would have to set this to tr](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m16s)

[somewhere can I do that uh has clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m20s)

[button there so if I do this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m24s)

[and I assume the sender is going to drop](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m28s)

[me into okay it does drop me into the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m30s)

[textbox version because that's what had](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m31s)

[the actual thing on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m33s)

[it and then it actually clears all the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m37s)

[way](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m39s)

[out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m41s)

[okay I am](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m43s)

[wondering so one of the things I am](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m46s)

[noticing no those do line up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m53s)

[contrast is not great on the yeah the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h44m59s)

[top one up here is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m01s)

[not yeah this is this is bad I can agree](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m04s)

[with that I think it was actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m07s)

[originally developed in light theme and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m08s)

[it's because of the color Zone stuff we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m12s)

[probably you know what we can just fix](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m15s)

[that while we're in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m17s)

[here you make a good point let's just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m18s)

[fix it let's just fix it uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m21s)

[JC good morning good evening](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m24s)

[uh let's see rather than doing this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m28s)

[stuff let's just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m31s)

[not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m35s)

[um and let's go real quick look at the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m37s)

[group](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m39s)

[box one cuz what would I expect to use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m40s)

[here I think it's more akin to this and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m53s)

[that's just the default so if we go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m57s)

[default it'll probably look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h45m59s)

[better let's see let's see what default](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m04s)

[looks like because I do wonder if some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m06s)

[of those have some hardcoded things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m09s)

[set that's slightly better but also now](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m13s)

[I'm realizing why it was set the way it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m16s)

[was because some of these things are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m18s)

[changing up cu the group box header](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m20s)

[wasn't ever really intended to be used](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m22s)

[the way that it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m27s)

[here um okay so let's change this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m29s)

[out um rather than](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m32s)

[doing I think we'll we'll go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m35s)

[custom and I I think let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m37s)

[do where's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m41s)

[the I would like to look at the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h46m43s)

[uh uh material](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m13s)

[design](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m16s)

[stuff that's set at the window level](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m30s)

[just bring it down it's probably the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m33s)

[easiest yeah brush background brush](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m38s)

[foreground that'll probably give us a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m41s)

[much better](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m42s)

[look uh brush](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m44s)

[background and that'll probably go much](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m51s)

[just better](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h47m54s)

[there now the contrast doesn't look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m03s)

[quite as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m05s)

[bad some of the hinty stuff is kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m06s)

[bumped up against each other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m10s)

[bigger 10's probably too big uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m47s)

[try six see what that looks](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m50s)

[like that looks a little nicer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m53s)

[now they don't collide with each other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m57s)

[quite as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h48m58s)

[much yeah something more like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h49m00s)

[that something more like that and then I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h49m03s)

[wanted it was it that much to ask for is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m08s)

[it really that much to ask for let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m11s)

[and then let's do border thickness](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m14s)

[order brush didn't do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m37s)

[anything interesting is border brush not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m41s)

[implemented on group](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m44s)

[let's let's let's get this guy squared](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m51s)

[away okay so we do there as clear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m53s)

[button that works that works okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h51m58s)

[let's let's check out the bookmarks but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m01s)

[I wanted to look at that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m04s)

[look at that this we checked so we'll](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m05s)

[turn that bookmark](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m08s)

[off okay so now we're left with the two](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m12s)

[time picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m15s)

[assists because I'm not real sure we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m16s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m19s)

[using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m22s)

[these why can't you to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m25s)

[navigate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m27s)

[okay WPF you are not making me feel warm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m29s)

[and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m32s)

[fuzzy oh and this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m33s)

[obsolete got it so this guy really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m40s)

[shouldn't be used at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m43s)

[all so this should be going to textbox](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m45s)

[assist](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m48s)

[instead so what is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m51s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h52m56s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m04s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m06s)

[What uh let's see I am trying to debug](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m13s)

[velop Pac and want to log to a file](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m16s)

[would you use Trace listener or an ey](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m19s)

[logger oh good question so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m22s)

[what type of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m28s)

[app uh so ilogger is an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m29s)

[abstraction and it kind of depends](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m33s)

[because you can log to an ey logger but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m35s)

[then my my next question will be what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m37s)

[logging providers have you plugged in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m39s)

[behind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m41s)

[ilogger Okay ey logger with the generic](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m42s)

[host okay so I'm guessing you're are are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m45s)

[you doing something somewhat similar to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m47s)

[like my my WPF](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m49s)

[template](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m53s)

[um where it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m55s)

[does uh let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h53m59s)

[the yeah okay so you've got something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m03s)

[similar to this um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m06s)

[so ilogger is probably easiest the um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m09s)

[you do need to make sure that you plug](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m15s)

[in oh you've got a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m17s)

[re oh right right I think we looked at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m20s)

[this one before um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m23s)

[yeah I think I've seen the I think I've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m26s)

[seen this at before so uh I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m28s)

[logger uh providers there is a lovely](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m33s)

[page](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m37s)

[here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m39s)

[um that I often](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m42s)

[reference so the the thing is is you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m45s)

[can't use the console](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m48s)

[logger um because WPF sucks and and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m51s)

[swallows St](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m55s)

[out which makes it kind of a pain in the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m56s)

[neck because occasionally people try to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h54m59s)

[launch WPF from the command line and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m01s)

[they expect to see some you know console](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m02s)

[right line messages and you just don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m04s)

[get anything because that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m06s)

[right so um the the key thing will be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m09s)

[making sure that you set up um an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m13s)

[appropriate logging provider to log](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m17s)

[to um the the built-in logging providers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m20s)

[like the event log works the Event](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m26s)

[Source Works um logging to a file is not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m28s)

[um the I think the easiest thing to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m35s)

[is something like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m38s)

[serilog because there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m40s)

[these logging providers that come with a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m43s)

[lot more stuff Siri log and enlog I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m46s)

[think are probably two of the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m49s)

[biggest ones um and in Siri log's case](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m51s)

[they refer to it as a sync um versus a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m54s)

[logging provider same thing it's where](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h55m58s)

[do I send my log messages to but as you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m00s)

[can see seral log has a few more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m03s)

[options so often times if you are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m07s)

[looking to push stuff out um Siri log](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m10s)

[will uh there will be a sync available](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m14s)

[to you so just know you typically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m17s)

[install sir log and then you install one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m19s)

[or more of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m23s)

[syns um serilog is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m24s)

[goated yeah uh it I I think serilog is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m28s)

[slowly starting to win out as in terms](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m31s)

[of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m34s)

[popularity like I don't I don't remember](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m35s)

[what their their Nate package download](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m37s)

[numbers are but I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m39s)

[yei let's just look because I can't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m43s)

[resist now now that I said it so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m45s)

[1.2 billion not million that's a b](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m49s)

[billion yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m54s)

[1.2 billion downloads they all can't be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h56m57s)

[dumb um so it is it is worth noting it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m00s)

[because then you have very simple setup](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m04s)

[here uh in terms of plugging it into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m07s)

[your um generic host where is their docs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m10s)

[the the one thing to remember about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m15s)

[generic host is most people will still](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m17s)

[refer to it as like ASP net core](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m19s)

[integration or similar because they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m22s)

[forget that generic host can live](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m24s)

[outside of that um which I always find](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m26s)

[hysterical uh life cycles](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m31s)

[logger where is the uh Ser](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m35s)

[log uh let's see I logger dependency](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m40s)

[injection because it should just be um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m46s)

[you'll see their references about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m49s)

[um uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m53s)

[this will probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m56s)

[work yeah this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h57m58s)

[one yeah so this is web host Builder um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m01s)

[but you'll note he also does call out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m05s)

[the the generic host as an option I just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m07s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m11s)

[know sirlo extensions hosting this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m12s)

[this is likely the guy that you want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m15s)

[um yeah this will be the guy that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m18s)

[install to give you the nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m22s)

[registration method so that guy there in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m25s)

[this case he's installing the console](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m28s)

[sync uh you don't want to use console](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m31s)

[sync with WPF uh anything else is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m35s)

[option um and you'll see here this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m36s)

[directly from Siri log's sample of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m39s)

[setting up this static property of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m43s)

[logger the reason they recommend doing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m45s)

[this is so that or I should say why they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m47s)

[say to do this immediately upon main is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m50s)

[because if anything goes wrong in your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m52s)

[building up of your generic host seral](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m56s)

[log can't run until after it's been](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h58m59s)

[initialized so if you want to catch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m02s)

[things that are part of the startup this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m04s)

[is why they have you do this and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m06s)

[this gets swapped out with the di](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m08s)

[instance once that's up and running they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m10s)

[handle that behind the scenes for you if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m12s)

[you don't care about catching things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m14s)

[during the the startup like for example](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m16s)

[this would not work right because your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m18s)

[host Builder hasn't been built yet um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m21s)

[you don't need this un it's only for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m25s)

[catching those early startup things if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m27s)

[you're like eh whatever doesn't really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m28s)

[matter but this here is the key line](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m30s)

[that needs to be added and you'll note](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m33s)

[it gets added on right after your host](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m35s)

[Builder so in terms of your app uh that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m37s)

[would end up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m42s)

[going probably between 24 and 25 would](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m44s)

[be where I would slap it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m47s)

[in just looking to see if you have a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m49s)

[better option inside of here for doing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m51s)

[it I'd probably put](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m55s)

[it here between 24 and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=00h59m57s)

[25 that would be my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m01s)

[theory um JC do let me know how how](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m08s)

[things go with um velop Pac and what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m13s)

[issues you're running into um we are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m16s)

[very very close on our public beta we've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m20s)

[got I think literally three tickets left](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m22s)

[on my backlog I got to show this because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m24s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m27s)

[really okay so before people critique](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m28s)

[sign me in sign me in let me in look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m32s)

[it's a pretty pretty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m37s)

[icon we have a pretty pretty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m41s)

[icon uh let's see why is it so confusing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m44s)

[to add a login system that is actually a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m47s)

[very fair question um the ironic part is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m50s)

[the the entire Genesis of this was to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m56s)

[make adding a loging system easier that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h00m58s)

[that's the really funny part with with a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m01s)

[lot of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m04s)

[this um the if I jump back to this link](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m05s)

[here the the login system ones the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m09s)

[idea with the generic host was Microsoft](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m13s)

[realized that there's a lot of things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m16s)

[every app needs it typically wants some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m18s)

[sort of di container it typically wants](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m20s)

[logging like there's some of these kind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m23s)

[of basic fundamental things that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m25s)

[just want in all your apps and so they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m27s)

[went perfect we'll plug this in but then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m29s)

[you'll note they that there's only a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m33s)

[handful of built-in logging providers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m35s)

[and they like they got so close right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m38s)

[and they they're like well we don't want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m42s)

[to build login providers for everything](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m44s)

[we'll just leave that to the the various](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m47s)

[logging libraries to let them provide](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m49s)

[what they already do a good job at it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m51s)

[like yes but you didn't quite put enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m54s)

[in the Box to be useful you got so close](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h01m57s)

[so close um and I will say even within](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m02s)

[console there are this these docs are a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m05s)

[little out of date there are two](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m08s)

[different console providers that are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m10s)

[available um one leverages like newer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m14s)

[terminal stuff because the old console](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m16s)

[stuff used to be you know ye oldy stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m19s)

[but now they've got one that supports](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m22s)

[like anti codes and coloring and that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m24s)

[kind of stuff was like oh great you've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m25s)

[gotten mildly better but yeah so it's it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m27s)

[shouldn't be hard](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m31s)

[um but it's not great uh vpac does a log](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m34s)

[is there any way to programmatically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m39s)

[make that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m42s)

[verose that's a good question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m45s)

[honestly I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m49s)

[know um let's look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m51s)

[if only we had somebody who had access](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m56s)

[to the repo oh wait that's me](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h02m59s)

[uh uh I will say too I did recently](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m03s)

[update my Uno sample so it's now even](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m06s)

[simpler than what I showed it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m09s)

[before it's dirt simple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m11s)

[okay okay so let's take a look here so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m15s)

[you are coming in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m18s)

[here and you are going through the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m20s)

[update manager and this guy here I think](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m23s)

[is what has the ey](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m26s)

[logger this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m28s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m31s)

[so you are passing in your own ey logger](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m34s)

[instance correct or are you looking for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m38s)

[the built-in logger because the this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m40s)

[default logger](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m42s)

[here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m46s)

[is uh oh your branches fell back oh even](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m48s)

[better even better hang on let](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m51s)

[me me grab](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m54s)

[sorry scrolling up scrolling up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h03m58s)

[scrolling up if we go here we go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m00s)

[here okay and I go here and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m05s)

[be looking somewhere in here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m08s)

[probably and you've got this all set up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m11s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m16s)

[great you rolled your own main with an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m19s)

[async main with the generic host stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m22s)

[all set up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m24s)

[great that's all fine and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m30s)

[where where are you running into uh uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m34s)

[let's see my Branch any suggestions](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m38s)

[welcome on the settings page and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m40s)

[features okay that's where I was going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m42s)

[to ask](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m44s)

[next so I'm going to assume the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m46s)

[interesting stuff is probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m48s)

[here let's see user settings theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m51s)

[wrapper database](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m54s)

[uh from a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h04m57s)

[share sorry I may I may need context JC](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m02s)

[I I missed where from a share what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m05s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m07s)

[referencing let's see on printer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m08s)

[change Dynamo Dynamo printer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m11s)

[change](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m14s)

[col check for update okay cool update](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m15s)

[status check for update update manager](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m20s)

[is null bail early otherwise we do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m22s)

[update manager check for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m26s)

[updates uh problems with updating from a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m28s)

[shared Drive ah okay so it's the update](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m31s)

[Source got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m34s)

[it okay we'll go look at that here in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m36s)

[second I just want to double check](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m38s)

[this uh so pull down updates if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m40s)

[don't get an update early exit otherwise](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m44s)

[we're going to build up the the new](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m47s)

[version and the update](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m50s)

[State okay and then the update state is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m54s)

[update available which triggers can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h05m57s)

[download uh let's see can execute this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m01s)

[can download does update State trigger](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m04s)

[the where is it oh it's it's probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m09s)

[generated probably why hang](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m13s)

[on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m18s)

[uh yeah that's kind of what I thought](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m19s)

[it's because we're using the new Source](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m23s)

[generator stuff which is great unless](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m25s)

[okay there we go default update](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m28s)

[available update downloaded Okay cool so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m30s)

[that just walks through](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m33s)

[there uh it does work but the download](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m35s)

[stalled and worked again on next](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m38s)

[restart oh the download](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m43s)

[installed interesting so the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m46s)

[one the one thing I am noticing is you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m50s)

[have the configure weight true on a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m53s)

[of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m56s)

[these you probably don't you you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h06m58s)

[probably actually want to go configure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m01s)

[weight false in most cases so configure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m02s)

[weight true tells the um the async of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m06s)

[weight that everything after your a weit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m10s)

[keyword should attempt to go back to the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m12s)

[thread that it came in on now that's not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m15s)

[always possible if it's not a UI thread](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m17s)

[so a UI thread in WPF is going to have a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m20s)

[synchronization context that it can go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m22s)

[ahead and Marshall back to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m24s)

[but there's nothing in here that really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m26s)

[needs to be on the UI thread after this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m28s)

[await so typically you'll do configure a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m30s)

[weight false in most](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m32s)

[cases and in fact in nearly every case](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m34s)

[you do configure a weight false there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m37s)

[uh it's installed when I didn't so I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m40s)

[added](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m43s)

[it uh did it stall when you had](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m45s)

[configure weight false or did it just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m47s)

[stall when you didn't have configure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m49s)

[weight because the default behavior is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m51s)

[configur weight true so without it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m54s)

[present you probably got the same](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m57s)

[behavior no call yeah so I might tell](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h07m59s)

[you first of all I'd switch this to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m03s)

[configure weight false because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m05s)

[that's that's potentially one area of it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m07s)

[the this guy goes through here this goes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m14s)

[through here the other thing that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m17s)

[can do because you're just building](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m19s)

[these updates and putting them on a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m21s)

[shared drive right because you're just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m23s)

[practicing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m25s)

[your updates from yeah a local path](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m26s)

[which is totally fine right like this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m28s)

[release URL can be whatever you want it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m30s)

[can be a local file path it could be a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m32s)

[URL it just needs to be the place where](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m34s)

[vopat can get um that Json file and the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m37s)

[relevant other files that go along with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m40s)

[the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m42s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m43s)

[so i' I tell you to start with configure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m46s)

[weight false on some of these and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m50s)

[the other thing that you can actually do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m56s)

[is um if you're building these um these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h08m59s)

[builds yourself you can actually uh just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m03s)

[attach your debugger to it directly so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m07s)

[when the app is running uh inside of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m10s)

[visual studio if you just go Um well I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m12s)

[got to hang on I got to stop my current](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m17s)

[debug session but uh you can do debug](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m18s)

[attached to process so what you might do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m22s)

[is once your app is up and running pop](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m25s)

[your settings window and then just do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m28s)

[attach to process because if you built](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m30s)

[the um the application locally and you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m33s)

[did like VPK pack or or similar to make](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m37s)

[the installer all of the the references](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m40s)

[are still going to match your source](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m43s)

[code that you have sitting there locally](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m45s)

[so if your source code matches the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m47s)

[running application you should be able](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m49s)

[to attach and get a halfway decent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m51s)

[debugging experience it it will be even](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m53s)

[better if you built the installer uh in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m56s)

[debug mode rather than in release mode](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h09m59s)

[so if you uh did like a net publish - c](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m02s)

[debug your debugging experience will be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m07s)

[even nicer because that means the um the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m09s)

[I instructions in your assembly will](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m13s)

[have all the extra debug statements in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m14s)

[there whereas release mode it you know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m16s)

[optimizes for performance which is great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m19s)

[but it means your debugging experience](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m21s)

[suffers uh because of it so I might tell](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m23s)

[you to try that as well because then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m26s)

[rather than fussing with trying to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m28s)

[uh like logging to files to to track](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m32s)

[this down you could just straight up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m35s)

[attach your debugger and then step](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m37s)

[through it that way and that that might](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m38s)

[be a much easier approach to to tracking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m40s)

[down any issues because that's often](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m44s)

[times what I'll do is I'll just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m46s)

[attach um because you can debug running](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m47s)

[applications even if you don't start](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m51s)

[them from Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m53s)

[Izzy Merry Christmas I'm late too much](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m56s)

[overtime uh welcome Izzy it's always](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h10m59s)

[great to have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m02s)

[you I got a little sidetracked on some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m04s)

[questions on a WPF app uh doing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m06s)

[updates um but JC let me know if if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m10s)

[those two changes don't work so being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m13s)

[switched to configure weight false and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m16s)

[then um try attaching your debugger to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m19s)

[it to see if that sheds any light if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m22s)

[that doesn't work let me know and we can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m24s)

[see about cloning this and running](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m26s)

[locally and like all I don't have a k](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m27s)

[drive but I'll just switch this file](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m31s)

[path to be something else and we can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m32s)

[take we can take a look at it and see if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m34s)

[that makes any](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m36s)

[difference but I mean overall this like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m37s)

[this is kind of what a lot of WPF stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m40s)

[looks like I personally don't like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m43s)

[message boxes because they're they're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m45s)

[kind of ugly but yeah it works it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m48s)

[works it absolutely](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m53s)

[works and I I I am actually impressed to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h11m57s)

[see this kind of thing with with some of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m00s)

[this testing oh I wanted to call](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m02s)

[something out so last](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m04s)

[week last week uh one of the viewers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m08s)

[shared this article here and I I put it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m12s)

[on my list of things to go and review](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m17s)

[after the stream and I and I did start](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m18s)

[going through it and I realized I had](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m21s)

[seen this before many years ago](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m23s)

[completely had forgotten that yeah no](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m25s)

[problem JC let like I said let me know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m28s)

[if there's still issues and and we can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m30s)

[see about troubleshooting and get them](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m32s)

[working because again especially if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m34s)

[there's problems like we want to find](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m36s)

[those um but this article or or I guess](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m40s)

[series of talks um is very very good uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m44s)

[I will summarize so three people right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m50s)

[uh involved in these and I so the bottom](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m54s)

[guy here is the author of like Ruby on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h12m57s)

[Rails um uh Kent Beck here is the author](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m00s)

[of uh extreme programming and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m05s)

[Martin Fowler is known uh honestly as I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m08s)

[I would say he's one of the the big](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m13s)

[names when it comes to like net](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m15s)

[refactoring test driven development](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m18s)

[Etc uh he's got a long resume](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m21s)

[but the the whole discussion started](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m25s)

[because uh David oh boy I'm gonna H hit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m28s)

[in my Hansen I'm hoping I got somewhere](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m32s)

[close um he had posted an article and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m35s)

[bear in mind this is back in 2014 like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m38s)

[this is this is y old stuff um but he](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m40s)

[had posted a blog post saying hey tdd is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m42s)

[dead uh and he had a lot of I won't say](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m45s)

[unreasonable CR critiques of test driven](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m49s)

[development like he has some very good](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m52s)

[points like I can't disagree with some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m54s)

[of the things that he hates um but this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h13m56s)

[entire series is very much worth](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m00s)

[watching one it is a I think a decent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m02s)

[example of showing how developers can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m05s)

[disagree and still have a discussion on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m10s)

[a topic right like the one thing that I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m12s)

[did note in going through all of this it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m15s)

[is clear that all three of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m17s)

[gentlemen care a great deal about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m19s)

[producing good software and are are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m21s)

[willing to listen and and Converse with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m24s)

[each other and go back and forth even if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m26s)

[they don't necessarily see see eye to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m28s)

[eye in a lot of cases there's also a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m30s)

[of really good comments in here about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m33s)

[how much testing and what type of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m36s)

[testing should you do and I think one of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m38s)

[the things that I that I heard in a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m40s)

[of the the talks is they all agree that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m43s)

[there's kind of this extreme level of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m47s)

[testing and test driven development that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m50s)

[some people have bought into that isn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m52s)

[accurate in a lot of cases right of uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h14m56s)

[the idea that A test should be isolated](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m00s)

[to just a single](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m02s)

[method I think I talked about this a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m04s)

[little bit with like some of my my vpac](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m06s)

[stuff but I don't do that like I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m08s)

[write my unit tests trying to isolate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m10s)

[every little class and Method and don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m13s)

[let it touch any other part of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m15s)

[system I don't like that um one of my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m16s)

[comments that I've told people before is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m20s)

[I think mocks are a necessary evil](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m21s)

[because every time you put a mock in it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m24s)

[it puts a seam in your code and like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m26s)

[whether you're doing Plumbing or sewing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m30s)

[or whatever anytime you have a seam it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m31s)

[right at that joint where where the bugs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m34s)

[creep in and problems come into play and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m36s)

[so people who spend a lot of time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m39s)

[putting lots of seams in their code for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m42s)

[testing still end up with bugs and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m43s)

[think this was one of David's big points](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m46s)

[is it doesn't always make the code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m48s)

[better right like it can make the code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m50s)

[better and that was a lot of the uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m53s)

[discussion between uh these guys is what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m55s)

[is appropriate and and I think one of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h15m59s)

[the best ones was what is what is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m01s)

[tradeoff right the this cost of testing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m04s)

[one down here was really good and the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m06s)

[test induced design damage I also found](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m08s)

[to be very good of trying to figure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m11s)

[out like there's a A plus and a minus to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m14s)

[everything right there's an old saying](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m18s)

[that software Architects all you need to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m20s)

[be a software architect is memorize the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m22s)

[phrase it depends and that's the answer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m24s)

[to every question and there's a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m27s)

[bit of Truth in that because like some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m29s)

[people will tell you that there's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m32s)

[silver bullet of this is the way you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m33s)

[build software you follow these patterns](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m35s)

[you do this stuff and it's all going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m37s)

[be great and that is a boldface lie](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m38s)

[right everything has pros and cons and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m41s)

[it's important to understand both of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m44s)

[those and then make a decision because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m46s)

[sometimes you look at the the pros and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m48s)

[cons of something and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m49s)

[go yeah those don't matter to me or or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m51s)

[the the of that are not a problem for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m54s)

[for this project that we're on great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m56s)

[right that's perfect but at least](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h16m58s)

[understand those trade-offs and make a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m00s)

[good uh make a good design thing and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m02s)

[think like they don't explicitly say it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m05s)

[but but I think that's kind of a general](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m09s)

[consensus that these three gentlemen](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m11s)

[kind of came to um in a lot of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m13s)

[like I said they don't always agree and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m15s)

[sometimes they just discuss the problems](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m17s)

[without actually providing a lot of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m19s)

[solutions or guidance but I think that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m21s)

[a a key takeaway is making sure that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m25s)

[understand those pros and cons](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m28s)

[understand what the the key objectives](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m30s)

[are and and work towards that right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m31s)

[because there there are pluses and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m34s)

[minuses right and I the the cost of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m36s)

[testing one I thought was exceptionally](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m38s)

[good so if anybody is interested highly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m41s)

[recommend watching these I think the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m44s)

[first of four or 30 minutes each and the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m46s)

[the last one he labeled it part five but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m49s)

[I think the video is actually labeled](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m52s)

[parts five and six and they go for an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m53s)

[hour instead of a half hour if I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m55s)

[remember right something of that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h17m58s)

[nature](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m00s)

[okay okay so we were backing up we were](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m02s)

[closing this we were here okay so this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m07s)

[thing was using time picker assist and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m12s)

[we don't want to use time picker assist](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m14s)

[because it's obsolete the problem is is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m16s)

[it's also referencing textbox](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m18s)

[assist which doesn't exist so that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m20s)

[that's exciting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m23s)

[I think it's text field assist is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m26s)

[probably the one that's expected to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m28s)

[used](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m31s)

[um it's probably the expectation](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m37s)

[here uh outline border inactive](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m40s)

[thickness let's see here do we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m44s)

[have something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m47s)

[yeah I think that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m56s)

[right simply use border thickness so I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h18m58s)

[think this guy has a border](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m02s)

[thickness uh he he does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m05s)

[not where the heck is border](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m09s)

[thickness this is a great example of why](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m13s)

[of how code comments just are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m15s)

[meaningless because at a certain](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m19s)

[point they uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m22s)

[they just don't work](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m27s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m29s)

[uh okay there's a constant where are you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m39s)

[referenced right date picker assist time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m46s)

[picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m49s)

[assist huh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h19m51s)

[so right okay so we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m05s)

[couple things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m08s)

[one if this is only used inside of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m12s)

[obsolete classes we should probably mark](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m14s)

[it as obsolete let me guess you're only](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m16s)

[used in obsolete classes yeah so you're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m19s)

[going to be obsolete](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m21s)

[too okay okay so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m23s)

[make that real clear what's going on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m25s)

[here and then you aren't referenced](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m28s)

[anywhere so we're just going to kill](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m31s)

[you we're just going to clean some stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m34s)

[up while we're in here is this relevant](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m37s)

[to what we were doing nope but are we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m38s)

[going to clean it up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m41s)

[yep because I have faith in my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m45s)

[testing yep these are all just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m51s)

[yeah I'm guessing these got move or the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h20m58s)

[the usage of these got cleaned up and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m00s)

[all of that um attached property stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m03s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m06s)

[it okay so is any of this being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m09s)

[referenced boy I have a hard time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m15s)

[believing none of this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m17s)

[referenced oh dang it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m18s)

[dang it dang it dang it dang it dang it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m26s)

[dang it dang it I just realized to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m28s)

[find the the find references no find](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m31s)

[zaml references okay hold on we're going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m35s)

[to put this back yeah great question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m37s)

[Izzy so we are taking a look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m39s)

[at let me clear this up so the 5.0](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m43s)

[version or the the 51](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m47s)

[version](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m50s)

[released right uh let me see here oh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m52s)

[that's what I was going to do tonight](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m54s)

[somebody remind me actions fix I want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m56s)

[fix it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h21m59s)

[um hold on this was put in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h22m02s)

[510 uh let's see here these can't be in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h22m05s)

[510 because 5100 has already released so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h22m09s)

[while I ran one of my machines with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m04s)

[resharper and one of them without and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m06s)

[started to find that I was a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m08s)

[faster without it and so the benefit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m10s)

[that it was giving me was not enough to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m12s)

[offset the the slowness that it added](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m15s)

[but Ryder at least from what my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m19s)

[colleagues have shown me is basically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m21s)

[um resharper if like on steroids like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m24s)

[the whole IDE is the the fancy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m29s)

[tool](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m32s)

[um so oh yeah I got an update to next](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m35s)

[week to up that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m37s)

[sweet yeah and that's the thing is in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m39s)

[lot of cases I think you can abandon vs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m41s)

[there are a handful of times where I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m45s)

[have seen writer slightly lag behind um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m48s)

[specifically when Visual Studio is in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m52s)

[the process process of building out some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m54s)

[new feature like centralized package](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m55s)

[management some of the source generator](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m58s)

[stuff when those things first launched](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h23m59s)

[um jet brains lagged behind a little bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m02s)

[on getting support for it but it wasn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m05s)

[bad and it was really only](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m07s)

[noticeable because I was running preview](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m09s)

[versions of Visual Studio not like the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m12s)

[stable versions of Visual Studio like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m16s)

[think Ryder easily keeps up and passes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m18s)

[the stable versions of Visual Studio but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m20s)

[sometimes lags behind a little bit of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m22s)

[the preview versions cuz I imagine they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m23s)

[don't want to waste time implementing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m26s)

[you know support for something that then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m28s)

[changes out from under them which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m29s)

[totally makes sense right none of us](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m31s)

[like that so there's just a handful of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m32s)

[times with stuff like that I'm like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m36s)

[H but like overall there's some stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m39s)

[that it does that is really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m42s)

[good um and in my opinion I feel like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m45s)

[need to be good with both like this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m48s)

[sometimes people say specialize but in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m51s)

[this case because I do so much work with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m53s)

[uh pairing with other um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h24m56s)

[developers I think at least from my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m00s)

[perspective of what I do a lot is it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m02s)

[important to be fluent enough in the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m05s)

[tools that the people I'm helping are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m07s)

[using so that I can at least](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m09s)

[intelligently you know go back and forth](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m11s)

[with them](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m13s)

[right um it's a shame that some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m15s)

[companies Outlaw jet brains tool because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m18s)

[of geography](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m19s)

[yeah yeah like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m21s)

[my personal opinion is companies](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m24s)

[should let developers pick their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m28s)

[whatever tool they're going to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m31s)

[fastest in right if somebody said they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m32s)

[wanted to build C in Visual Studio code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m34s)

[because that's how they felt that they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m38s)

[were fastest great if somebody felt like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m39s)

[they were fastest in Visual Studio great](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m42s)

[if they liked writer great like I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m44s)

[know if I'd support notepad or something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m46s)

[like that but you know if somebody want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m48s)

[to use like I I've got several](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m49s)

[colleagues that like um using Vim](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m52s)

[plugins because like they have a a Vim](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h25m55s)

[background that's where they feel](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m00s)

[fanciest and sometimes they can do some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m01s)

[insane keyboard shortcut stuff that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m05s)

[doesn't make sense to me and poof things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m08s)

[come out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m10s)

[um but yeah so there there's things like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m12s)

[that where I think a lot of times when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m15s)

[people ban tools or don't let people use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m17s)

[it it's like you're only handicapping](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m19s)

[your own developers like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m21s)

[notepad](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h26m28s)

[autosave scratch Pad was insanely high](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h27m23s)

[Autos saves your transient stuff I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h27m44s)

[like they literally did that to compete](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h27m47s)

[with notepad Plus+ I absolutely do that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h27m49s)

[mini for yes yes see that is exact those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h27m52s)

[they did not add in all the features of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h28m25s)

[notepad++ but I think they quickly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h28m27s)

[tools I think they've done a fairly good](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m09s)

[job](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m11s)

[of finding those areas where there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m12s)

[enough developers on a language or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m15s)

[framework to Warrant actually building](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m17s)

[out a good ide experience and I will say](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m19s)

[jet brains they build good idees like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m22s)

[there's a reason even Google punted to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m25s)

[them to say hey you want to help us](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m27s)

[build a really nice Android](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m29s)

[Studio like points on you uh Google like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m33s)

[that was a wise choice like they did](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m38s)

[they would like pick the people who are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m42s)

[doing a great job and say let's build](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m43s)

[this that was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m46s)

[intelligent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m49s)

[uh uh yeah vs is kicking me out yeah the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m51s)

[honestly on a on a Mac Rider I think is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h32m56s)

[probably the bestnet IDE you can go with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m00s)

[the VSS code stuff is where Microsoft is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m03s)

[putting their Investments because they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m06s)

[they they didn't like splitting their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m08s)

[time between VSS for mac and VSS code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m10s)

[trying to make it work and so they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m13s)

[decided to just go all in on VSS code](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m15s)

[because VSS for Mac was not nearly as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m17s)

[popular but it's worth calling out that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m20s)

[the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m22s)

[the stuff on vs code is brand new it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m24s)

[like I've seen several issues with it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m28s)

[like they're like they're investing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m30s)

[heavily in it and I don't doubt it can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m32s)

[be good I don't think it's there yet um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m33s)

[is my opinion like it doesn't it like vs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m37s)

[code was never meant to be that full IDE](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m41s)

[experience it was meant to be like that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m44s)

[augmented development experience which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m46s)

[is great because that's what some people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m48s)

[want but it's like it means that you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m50s)

[just killed off your full ID experience](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m52s)

[and you don't have a full IDE experience](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m54s)

[and Ryder gives you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m56s)

[that let's see for me it was more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h33m58s)

[setting the default program uh in win](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m00s)

[SCP for PHP files to notepad and it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m02s)

[stayed that for a long](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m05s)

[time yeah yeah and notepad Plus+ being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m08s)

[lightweight like again the startup time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m11s)

[of that app was insanely fast I do not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m13s)

[doubt that they in that they actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m16s)

[invested time in making sure that their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m19s)

[startup was great like you don't don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m20s)

[get startup like that without putting in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m23s)

[some development effort and I and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m27s)

[don't doubt that that team or developer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m29s)

[I don't know how many people work on it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m31s)

[spent time on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m34s)

[that uh yeah uh does vs code even have a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m36s)

[WPF form viewer no so if you're talking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m41s)

[about like a designer experience it does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m44s)

[not and I don't know if they're going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m46s)

[spend](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m48s)

[time building a designer experience the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m49s)

[designer even in Visual Studio isn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m52s)

[great um it's always a best guess of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m54s)

[what the app might look like at runtime](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m57s)

[not what it will look like at runtime](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h34m59s)

[and so I've often given them the feed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m01s)

[back that what I would rather see them](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m03s)

[build out is get that hot reload](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m05s)

[experience because web developers have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m08s)

[had this for a long time they edit their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m10s)

[code and poof the browser updates and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m12s)

[they see the change and it's a very fast](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m14s)

[feedback loop and that's awesome right I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m16s)

[want that in my desktop app right I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m19s)

[a fast feedback I want to type some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m22s)

[changes and they have it kind of working](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m24s)

[for simple changes but it's very easy to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m27s)

[to hose it and have to start all over](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m29s)

[it's like h g like I get that it's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m31s)

[very different runtime it's not the same](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m35s)

[as being in a browser and blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m36s)

[like I get that it's much more difficult](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m38s)

[but I still want it it doesn't make me](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m41s)

[want it less it just makes me miss it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m43s)

[because that is one of the few areas of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m46s)

[web development that I think web devs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m48s)

[still have on thick client devs is they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m50s)

[have they have a very fast feedback loop](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m53s)

[when it comes to uh making UI changes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m56s)

[and seeing those reflected right away](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h35m59s)

[like they got a real good setup like and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m01s)

[most of the time when people want a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m04s)

[designer what they're really looking for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m05s)

[is I want that fast feedback loop yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m08s)

[that's what's nice about a WPF form](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m11s)

[viewer yeah is people want to see that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m13s)

[to see it come back my biggest issue](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m15s)

[with the designer though is that it it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m18s)

[never guaranteed to match what it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m20s)

[really going to look like at run time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m22s)

[right like the designer can kind of load](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m24s)

[it up but especially if you like use a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m26s)

[theme Library like material design and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m29s)

[zaml it like there are things that are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m31s)

[going to be applied at runtime that the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m34s)

[designer won't know about and so it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m36s)

[hard for the designer to show those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m39s)

[things without actually running your app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m40s)

[and at the point it's running your app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m42s)

[they might as well just do hot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m44s)

[reload like we're we're we're already](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m46s)

[there don't simulate it because then I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m49s)

[going to want to see with my data and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m51s)

[all that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m52s)

[so like it's one of those I really want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m54s)

[that really nice hot reload](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h36m57s)

[experience and I know it's hard and I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m01s)

[willing to sacrifice for it but I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m04s)

[it okay so we were still trying to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m06s)

[figure out where this thing goes because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m08s)

[this these comments are both wrong as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m10s)

[well](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m14s)

[um and I want to find the replacement](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m16s)

[I see I think it's worth building your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m25s)

[own control set yeah and honestly I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m26s)

[think in a lot of cases especially like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m29s)

[building this material design Library](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m31s)

[there's a fine balance to be struck in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m33s)

[what you actually create because when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m37s)

[you're building a library like this you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m38s)

[don't want to be overly prescriptive](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m41s)

[there was actually a an interesting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m43s)

[thread that happened in the Discord](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m45s)

[channel uh earlier today where a user](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m47s)

[dropped in talking about wanting to drop](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m50s)

[uh terer library because they were only](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m53s)

[using it for a handful of things um and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m55s)

[they were looking at some of the stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m57s)

[in the material design Library like the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h37m59s)

[multi-select treeview going well shoot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m00s)

[that's kind of meets the needs of of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m02s)

[what I was paying teler for and you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m05s)

[built a nice one I'm like ironically I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m07s)

[built it to get rid of terer in a in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m10s)

[production app because I was unhappy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m11s)

[with their rad Tree](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m13s)

[View which was a a major motivator to to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m15s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m18s)

[work and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m19s)

[so it's I I think it's nice but I think](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m21s)

[there's something that app developers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m24s)

[can do that Library developers can't is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m26s)

[they can narrow their focus based upon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m28s)

[what they're building even if it's just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m31s)

[like I'm building a custom control set](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m33s)

[for my company you can kind of start to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m35s)

[bring things in to say well here's my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m37s)

[company standards here's here's how this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m39s)

[is going to work whereas on a library](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m41s)

[like this I often times try to favor not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m43s)

[being too prescriptive and saying I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m46s)

[to make sure I've enabled people to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m49s)

[those things and not and not necessarily](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m51s)

[push too much in One Direction obviously](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m55s)

[like we try to set all of our defaults](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h38m58s)

[to whatever the the material design spec](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m00s)

[is to to try to say that's a starting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m02s)

[point but most of the time people when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m05s)

[they're building apps a lot of people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m08s)

[don't care about matching the material](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m10s)

[design spec as much as matching what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m11s)

[their what what they want their stuff to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m14s)

[look like and so trying to do that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m17s)

[especially when it comes to things like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m19s)

[well I really wish like in this case the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m20s)

[tree View having like F2 to edit um it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m22s)

[like I was like yeah I don't know if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m27s)

[we'd ever put something like that into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m29s)

[the the library I think I'd want to make](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m32s)

[sure that it's uh very easy for you to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m34s)

[implement but I don't know if I want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m37s)

[make that assumption that people want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m39s)

[it yeah yeah and and there is a balance](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m45s)

[to be struck between what is good in in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m49s)

[the general cases and what is good in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m51s)

[third party thing and that and that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m55s)

[where it kind of goes back and forth of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m56s)

[you know if there's I I often go with if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h39m58s)

[I get enough request for something it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m00s)

[indicates that there's a strong enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m03s)

[need and it doesn't mean we're always](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m04s)

[going to implement it but it at least](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m05s)

[starts communicating okay there's enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m07s)

[people out there where this need is not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m10s)

[being met and and sometimes it it comes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m12s)

[down to well this need is only really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m16s)

[met in a lot of people's paid libraries](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m18s)

[and usually I look at it and go well the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m21s)

[reasons it's in the paid libraries it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m22s)

[a pain in the butt to implement or it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m24s)

[going to take so much time to implement](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m25s)

[yeah maybe not right like it's like I've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m28s)

[only got so many hours in a day like we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m30s)

[we'll often tell people who ask for new](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m34s)

[controls in our library it's like well](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m36s)

[some controls we're going to implement](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m38s)

[but this isn't a controls Library it it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m40s)

[is it is a theme Library that's out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m42s)

[there so we'll we'll add some controls](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m45s)

[but new controls come kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m47s)

[slowly uh yeah I mean as in general as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m49s)

[in something like material design versus](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m53s)

[need a lot of unique features yeah no I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m54s)

[I agree that makes a lot of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h40m57s)

[sense I will say if you do have feedback](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m00s)

[on like stuff that's missing in this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m02s)

[library or or things that you would like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m04s)

[to see change feel free to throw those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m06s)

[out because that like I said that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m08s)

[information kind of helps Drive where](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m11s)

[like what type of stuff we're we end up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m14s)

[share of the work and so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m21s)

[we only have so many hours in a day but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m23s)

[if there is feedback of PE of things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m26s)

[that people want or even if people are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m27s)

[like hey I'm interested in implementing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m30s)

[it that's great right there's been a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m31s)

[of people whove come in they're like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m34s)

[really want this one feature and I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m35s)

[willing to build](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m36s)

[it great we are very willing to support](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m37s)

[you um I mean as long as the the thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m40s)

[lines up with what actually makes sense](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m43s)

[in the library but like that's how some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m45s)

[of these things came about like this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m47s)

[numeric up down control this started as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m49s)

[another users's re Quest and and open PR](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m51s)

[to try to go through and implement it so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m54s)

[and and even if people don't get it all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m57s)

[the way there if they get it far enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h41m58s)

[along to where it's like yeah we can get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m00s)

[this across the finish line for you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m02s)

[great like that's awesome I I will take](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m03s)

[getting it all the way there if you get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m16s)

[it most of the way there that's it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m17s)

[probably pretty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m19s)

[good okay so I want to look here and I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m20s)

[want to see outline border inactive thi](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m23s)

[thickness because this is the specific](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m26s)

[one uh that says border thickness I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m29s)

[to know where border thickness is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m32s)

[because this is clearly wrong and the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m37s)

[problem with just searching border](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m41s)

[thickness is border thickness exists in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m42s)

[a lot of oh I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m44s)

[know if it's an attached property it'll](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m46s)

[always have a period in front of it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m48s)

[interesting this is really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h42m58s)

[not yeah so so the work that was done](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m08s)

[was likely just bringing over the stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m11s)

[that existed in time picker or date](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m13s)

[picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m16s)

[but yeah because I'm want to bet](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m20s)

[yeah this guy here so that's what was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m24s)

[brought](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m26s)

[Milestone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h43m57s)

[um yeah because this was brought over](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m01s)

[and I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m03s)

[bet it was just a copy from the time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m05s)

[picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m08s)

[one I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m11s)

[like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m14s)

[um yeah so this guy okay so the uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m17s)

[simply use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m22s)

[I I think I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m23s)

[specific uh time picker border thickness](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m25s)

[property](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m28s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m29s)

[uh hey what is it is it uh dark dark8](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m33s)

[I'm probably butchering that how's it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m38s)

[going welcome to the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m40s)

[stream we're attempting to figure out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m42s)

[what I think what I think past Kevin may](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m46s)

[have written I mean I know the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m48s)

[commit message says my Michael but it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m50s)

[could have very easily been me um let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m54s)

[see date picker assist and I think this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m57s)

[is the same isn't it let's see date](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h44m58s)

[picker yeah so this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m01s)

[is use we're going to be specific date](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m03s)

[picker. border thickness property](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m07s)

[instead so we're going to be a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m09s)

[clear so that handles this because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m12s)

[don't think we want to bring this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m15s)

[over because this is a new control so we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m17s)

[don't need to we don't need to ingest](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m20s)

[some of the old stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m21s)

[um let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m23s)

[see and I think this is Tex field](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m25s)

[assist and this one was outline border](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m29s)

[active](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m34s)

[thickness let's see here do we have that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m35s)

[outline border active thickness yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m39s)

[uh see this was my best implementation](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m43s)

[of a Time picker in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m46s)

[WPF see that's not that doesn't look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m50s)

[that bad in my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m52s)

[opinion right of going through and doing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m55s)

[it yeah that that is not bad the one and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h45m59s)

[this is actually one of those areas](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m04s)

[where I'll show I I don't know if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m06s)

[seen this snow but the there is a Time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m08s)

[picker inside the material design](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m12s)

[library but I I've often thought about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m14s)

[making uh what did I do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m18s)

[wrong oh did I I I I deleted a constant](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m21s)

[didn't I hang on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m25s)

[uh where that constants field](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m28s)

[go what did I do wrong oh that's the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m32s)

[demo project that's that which line see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m35s)

[I knew I give me that thank you um I've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m38s)

[often thought about making multiple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m42s)

[templates for it like that's actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m44s)

[been one of the things that I think has](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m46s)

[been a strength of this library](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m47s)

[is as long as we can get the control](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m50s)

[correct in this case the time picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m53s)

[slapping a different control template on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m55s)

[there to make it look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h46m58s)

[better because the the Picker that we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m00s)

[have right now for the time picker](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m03s)

[is not always what people are looking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m07s)

[for right so for example this is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m10s)

[24-hour clock variant so if we say you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m14s)

[know like 230 right we can get something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m16s)

[of that nature but there is kind of a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m19s)

[bit of an issue with this in that it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m22s)

[doesn't play nice with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m24s)

[um uh it doesn't play nice with keyboard](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m28s)

[input yeah Darko uh so this is working](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m32s)

[on controls for the material design in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m35s)

[zaml projects so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m37s)

[WPF uh theming Library if you're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m40s)

[interested this is the the repo in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m42s)

[question um we are specifically looking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m44s)

[at a pull request uh here that is around](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m47s)

[adding the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m51s)

[um numeric up down controls so this last](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m54s)

[column here we previously already had](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h47m57s)

[these other uh five columns of controls](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m00s)

[implemented but the numeric up down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m03s)

[picker for doing these different looks](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m06s)

[is what is brand new and what we're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m09s)

[looking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m10s)

[at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m11s)

[um and in particular there was a change](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m13s)

[added here for supporting um an old](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m17s)

[obsolete property and I don't think](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m21s)

[we're going to keep that I I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m23s)

[because this is brand new I don't want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m25s)

[to bring obsolete stuff forward I kind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m26s)

[of just want to leave it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m29s)

[behind um and I was trying to figure out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m31s)

[because this thing was referencing the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m34s)

[text box to assist and it's text field](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m35s)

[assist so we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m40s)

[just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m42s)

[adjust the obsolete messages uh please](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m43s)

[use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m48s)

[uh that instead](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m50s)

[yeah so let's see maybe use two](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m57s)

[different inputs and tab switch box or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h48m58s)

[or two digits enter switches box to yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m01s)

[and that's the thing is I I've wanted to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m03s)

[go through and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m06s)

[add different control styles to this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m08s)

[because this is a great input for only](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m11s)

[some things it's not a great input for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m14s)

[everything right and like you can you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m16s)

[can click here and here to go between](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m19s)

[the hour and minute section if you want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m20s)

[but then you compare that to like some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m23s)

[of the date picker stuff it's like well](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m25s)

[it's kind of in line with the date](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m27s)

[picker this thing doesn't allow for it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m28s)

[and you can you can always type like if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m31s)

[you don't want this and you say well no](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m33s)

[what I want is you know I'm I'm bad at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m35s)

[24-hour clock so I'm going to forget to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m38s)

[add the two right now I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m40s)

[this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m42s)

[like like you can always type in and get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m43s)

[yourself there as well but it would be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m45s)

[nice to have some alternate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m48s)

[Styles um you ever work with Native date](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h49m50s)

[uh and now once Microsoft realized that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h50m23s)

[the best thing to do was to stop rolling](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=01h50m26s)

[out but they might be nice we are going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m20s)

[to put fix the S on that we like that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m23s)

[change in the demo app because that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m28s)

[makes the colors better and then down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m30s)

[here what did we change we just did some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m31s)

[extra spacing so yeah we'll keep that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m33s)

[in um and then let's see updated numeric](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m36s)

[up down styles to not uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m42s)

[leverage](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m47s)

[obsolete um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m49s)

[properties yeah because we don't want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m53s)

[we don't want to bring that forward okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m56s)

[so then we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m58s)

[go we're going to push it and we're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h00m59s)

[going to find out if I actually have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m01s)

[Push permissions to this repo yay thank](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m03s)

[you so for reference when you open a PR](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m05s)

[to an open source project leave the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m09s)

[checkbox checked that says let](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m11s)

[contributors push back to it it really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m13s)

[makes their life easier like not all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m15s)

[contributors are going to spend time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m17s)

[pushing back to your fork but the ones](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m19s)

[that do it's it's really really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m21s)

[convenient](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m28s)

[uh have you tried Visual Studio blend](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m30s)

[yeah though I think in this one uh Darko](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m33s)

[I think Pikachu's stuff is probably net](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m37s)

[Maui and blend as I'm aware does not do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m41s)

[Maui but you are correct styling it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m46s)

[blend for people who are UNAM Amil with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m50s)

[it is a product that came out I think it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m52s)

[was like in 2006 2008 Range it's been](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m55s)

[like the first version's fairly old um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h01m58s)

[but it came out as a compliment to when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m01s)

[WPF was being released which I believe](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m04s)

[was end of5 is 2006](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m06s)

[range um and it basically gave people a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m10s)

[lot more it gave designers what they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m13s)

[wanted right the whole idea with the WPF](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m16s)

[and the zaml was the developers can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m18s)

[build all the functionality and then the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m20s)

[designers can use blend to make it look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m22s)

[as pretty as it as we want it to and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m24s)

[then they all come together and play](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m26s)

[nice that was the dream um I think what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m28s)

[actually ended up happening is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m31s)

[developers with a More Design mindset](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m33s)

[used blend and regular designers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m34s)

[continue using what they were already](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m37s)

[used to I I think that's more or less](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m39s)

[how I saw it play out in most](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m41s)

[cases um which was which is fine but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m44s)

[it's not perfect oh that's what we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m49s)

[didn't do we didn't fix the tests hang](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m52s)

[on this is probably about to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m54s)

[break see this is why we have tests this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m56s)

[is why we have tests okay because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h02m59s)

[think that constant change and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m01s)

[specifically we have UI tests around the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m03s)

[numeric up down control which are useful](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m05s)

[to have and if I could spell numeric up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m08s)

[down control so we're just going to run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m12s)

[these because these are UI tests not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m13s)

[unit tests so they if you run the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m15s)

[Suite it takes like 10 minutes and we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m17s)

[aren't going to we're not going to spend](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m19s)

[time running those I most of these are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m22s)

[probably pretty](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m25s)

[close](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m28s)

[uh yeah and some devs just became](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m31s)

[designers on a per requirement basis yes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m34s)

[I I can agree with that I I actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m37s)

[went to a uh a couple build sessions](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m39s)

[like eight or nine years ago and they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m43s)

[had some sessions there that were](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m45s)

[specifically around like ux uh and UI](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m46s)

[because back in like the Windows 7](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m50s)

[Windows 8 era Microsoft actually used to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m52s)

[put out some really nice UI guidance of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m54s)

[hey here's what Windows apps should look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m57s)

[like they kind of stopped doing that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h03m59s)

[which is kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m00s)

[disappointing in favor of some of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m02s)

[stuff like instead they put out the um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m04s)

[shoot not fluent design um and those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m07s)

[docs kind of replaced](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m11s)

[it but the and at the time like I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m13s)

[remember the presenter was kind of you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m17s)

[know talking to the attendees trying to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m19s)

[you like before the presentation trying](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m21s)

[to figure out you know what people were](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m22s)

[hoping to hear and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m24s)

[which was great um and I made the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m25s)

[comment I was like yeah I'm a developer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m27s)

[but I end up doing a lot of design work](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m30s)

[and people it like that didn't register](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m31s)

[to them and I was like you guys need to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m34s)

[understand like developers end up doing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m37s)

[a decent chunk of design like not all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m39s)

[companies are fortunate enough to have a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m41s)

[UI ux person on hand with enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m43s)

[available time like some companies don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m46s)

[even have them and the compies that do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m50s)

[have them usually they're shared amongst](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m52s)

[a lot of developers and so sometimes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m55s)

[their time is quite](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m57s)

[limited um yeah I used to hate designers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h04m59s)

[I will say I have worked for some really](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m03s)

[good ones a really good designer is is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m05s)

[amazing like there's a couple that I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m10s)

[work with and one that I'm working with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m13s)

[now that are awesome they are absolutely](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m14s)

[awesome I will say if designers know a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m17s)

[little bit of coding or enough to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m19s)

[understand coding to to at least be able](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m21s)

[to make that assessment because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m23s)

[sometimes you get those designs from a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m24s)

[designer they're like well we could do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m25s)

[either of these whichever one's easier](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m27s)

[in code I really love it when the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m29s)

[designers know just enough coding to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m31s)

[able to make some of those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m33s)

[determinations on their own about kind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m35s)

[of understanding how code is structured](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m36s)

[what things are hard what things are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m39s)

[easy um like those designers are like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m41s)

[the the magical](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m44s)

[unicorn uh let's see this app is held](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m46s)

[together with Sho strings hopes and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m48s)

[dreams we were just trying to cross the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m49s)

[Finish](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m51s)

[Line](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m55s)

[yeah uh grids and tex styling yeah so if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h05m56s)

[like I said Pikachu if you've got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m02s)

[something uh that's sharable let me know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m03s)

[and happy to take a look okay so let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m06s)

[see what we broke on these failed to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m08s)

[find child element I'm willing to bet](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m11s)

[yeah it's it's going to be all of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m12s)

[things here oh oh that's what else we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m14s)

[failed to change I was going to rename](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m17s)

[that uh uh because the the control got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m20s)

[changed and we dropped the word field](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m26s)

[from this which is fine but I think we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m28s)

[want to drop the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m30s)

[word um field from that as well it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m32s)

[doesn't really make sense to have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m35s)

[both and so that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m38s)

[fixed that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m42s)

[fixed that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m44s)

[fixed and that one didn't fail so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m47s)

[perfect and now we run these and all all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m49s)

[work flawlessly unicorns only exist in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m53s)

[my son's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m55s)

[dreams I know but I I I've met these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h06m57s)

[designers I know of at least two in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m00s)

[existence they are out there there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m02s)

[just not enough of them and when you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m05s)

[find them they often just don't have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m08s)

[enough time which is really like I get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m10s)

[it well they they are they are hard to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m13s)

[quantify they are hard to quantify the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m16s)

[value that they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m18s)

[provide because it's really hard to put](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m20s)

[a number on good ux it's like you get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m22s)

[fewer users calling in like it's hard to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m26s)

[measure the absence of things and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m30s)

[sometimes people get lucky where they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m32s)

[like have oh you know this is how many](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m34s)

[you know user problems we were getting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m36s)

[before we did this ux redesign and this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m38s)

[is how many we were getting after right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m40s)

[like sometimes you're fortunate enough](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m41s)

[to have those numbers most cases no uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m43s)

[send me their details I'll build a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m47s)

[cloning machine](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m49s)

[uh yeah so good eye for design at know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m52s)

[at least a little bit of coding they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m56s)

[don't need to know a lot but a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h07m58s)

[bit um again I and it gets hard because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m00s)

[sometimes the designers who want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m03s)

[learn to code they don't know what to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m05s)

[learn right they learn some JavaScript](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m06s)

[and CSS and they're usually good at that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m08s)

[kind of stuff but it's I think the key](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m10s)

[thing that I like to see in a designer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m12s)

[is they know enough coding to understand](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m14s)

[the differences between what is easy and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m16s)

[what is hard in code because sometimes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m19s)

[they that's often where the barrier](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m21s)

[between the designer and the developer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m24s)

[is of knowing that dis difference and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m26s)

[sometimes it's as simple as you just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m29s)

[have a a quick chat and the and it goes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m30s)

[away but the ones that can tell that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m33s)

[difference often then produce designs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m35s)

[that are nice to implement not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m37s)

[necessarily easier to implement but nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m40s)

[to implement I'll put it that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m42s)

[way okay uh let's see fixing UI tests](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m44s)

[uh commit and send](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m51s)

[it okay okay now the other thing that I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m54s)

[wanted to fix because it annoyed me um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h08m58s)

[let's see and we're going to enable auto](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m01s)

[merge Auto merge and this one up here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m02s)

[needs to have Let's see we need this to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m05s)

[be labeled as an enhancement and I want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m08s)

[this on the release notes so we've got a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m11s)

[bunch of automation that we're about to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m13s)

[look at um and so anything with the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m15s)

[release notes label actually gets an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m17s)

[entry so when when you the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m19s)

[uh these lovely release notes including](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m23s)

[the contributors and all that stuff yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m26s)

[I didn't do any of that like I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m28s)

[write these this is this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m30s)

[automation](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m33s)

[um yeah which is awesome to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m34s)

[see uh designers 101 make it useful two](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m38s)

[make it simple three make it pretty I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m42s)

[think Izzy most designers have that same](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m44s)

[list but in a very different](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m47s)

[order uh like exactly the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m49s)

[opposite okay so what I would love to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m54s)

[do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h09m58s)

[uh uh let's see do you think window](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m00s)

[dimensions uh horizontal uh width of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m03s)

[material design test app increases the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m08s)

[elapse test time oh um does painting a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m11s)

[bigger window take longer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m15s)

[that is an excellent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m22s)

[question so the short answer is I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m26s)

[know the long answer is what I do know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m30s)

[so WPF is built on Direct](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m35s)

[X and there and there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m39s)

[are a number of steps between your zaml](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m43s)

[and the UI renderer where it does know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m46s)

[the sections of your app that are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m49s)

[changed so if you have a lot of things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m51s)

[updating that definitely slows it down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m54s)

[so I don't know if the size of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h10m57s)

[window matters but the number of visible](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m00s)

[changing elements absolutely](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m05s)

[does that that I know for certain does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m08s)

[because if you have a a lot of of moving](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m11s)

[parts that are moving around on the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m15s)

[screen and again if they're visible](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m17s)

[right like if you if if you've got like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m20s)

[a scroll viewer and it's you know 100](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m21s)

[million by 100 million the stuff that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m24s)

[off screen the the UI tree knows what's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m26s)

[visible and it just disregards rendering](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m29s)

[everything that's not visible because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m32s)

[it's a waste of time right that just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m33s)

[goes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m35s)

[away but if you have a large number of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m36s)

[visible elements changing those do cause](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m39s)

[UI repaints](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m42s)

[and I don't know that it makes it take](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m45s)

[it longer but I would be shocked to find](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m48s)

[that it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m50s)

[wasn't yeah yeah wanted to speed up test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m52s)

[and thought that might be a quick win](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m55s)

[yeah honestly the when I've measured the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m56s)

[performance the slowest part in the in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h11m58s)

[the tests um is on so in terms of like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m01s)

[the zaml test stuff that's going is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m04s)

[starting up the app so because this test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m06s)

[base when it actually does the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m11s)

[um so like inside oh no the test right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m15s)

[so most of these test do a test recorder](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m20s)

[and this guy here his purpose in life is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m22s)

[just to take screenshots so if a test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m24s)

[fails it screenshots the failing State](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m27s)

[and saves that so that you can see you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m29s)

[know why the test failed um but like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m31s)

[this load Z one this app initialize with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m34s)

[material design and create window this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m37s)

[is the Lion Share of the time because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m39s)

[this actually starts up and like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m43s)

[initializes the full running application](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m46s)

[and so there's a decent](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m49s)

[chunk part of this right like and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m52s)

[this initialize a sync this is what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m55s)

[actually is starting a remote WPF](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h12m58s)

[application and the process. start start](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m00s)

[takes a decent chunk of time there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m02s)

[probably some refactoring here that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m05s)

[could be done I've broken this apart by](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m07s)

[test class and so I only start up one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m10s)

[remote app per test class so every time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m12s)

[I add a new test class it adds another](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m15s)

[process start time which could be like a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m17s)

[second or two it's not huge but it's not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m20s)

[free either um and so there's there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m22s)

[potentially some remote app sharing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m25s)

[things but some of the tests](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m28s)

[intentionally start up a different](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m30s)

[process because they need to change like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m32s)

[the app. zamel or something critical to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m34s)

[the whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m37s)

[application so it would be nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m38s)

[uh is there a way in zamel to Mark a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m42s)

[node to always update in a single run or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m45s)

[update a background paint and swap them](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m48s)

[with render](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m50s)

[ah great question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m54s)

[no is so uh you do not in WPF the actual](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h13m58s)

[rendering pipeline is abstracted away](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m04s)

[from you you don't have direct access to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m06s)

[it and so you are unable to actually uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m09s)

[get down to kind of that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m13s)

[level that's one of the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m16s)

[things when you hear people talk about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m19s)

[like WPF render performance that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m21s)

[usually one of the areas that gets cited](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m23s)

[um and that's one of the things that got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m25s)

[changed with uh wi UI 2 and wi UI 3 is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m27s)

[being able to have some of that level of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m31s)

[control with that said you can kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m33s)

[cheat a little bit um because we know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m36s)

[that or or because we know how the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m40s)

[zaml updates you if you want to do kind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m43s)

[of like that double buffering thing like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m45s)

[you're you're talking about like the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m47s)

[update background paint and then swap](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m48s)

[them in with with renderer like there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m50s)

[a there's a nice](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m53s)

[project uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m55s)

[element where is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h14m59s)

[it where is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m02s)

[it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m05s)

[um it's not it yeah oh FFM Peg media](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m08s)

[that's what it is this is the guy yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m12s)

[this guy here so this is actually not a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m14s)

[bad example of doing it so this is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m17s)

[wrap around FFM to build a video player](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m19s)

[um and it runs in WPF which is great um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m23s)

[because this is an alternative to the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m26s)

[media element in WPF which admittedly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m28s)

[doesn't give you a lot of control um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m30s)

[I've done quite a bit of extensive work](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m32s)

[with this so I'm somewhat familiar with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m34s)

[this guy but it does do uh like a render](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m36s)

[Target bit map and it builds out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m39s)

[effectively that same sort of um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m42s)

[pipeline that you would expect in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m45s)

[video player building those frames up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m47s)

[behind the scenes reading in the packets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m49s)

[and then doing that swap as it goes that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m52s)

[way it keeps it running so but be aware](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m54s)

[building this you kind of build it from](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h15m58s)

[scratch and you're kind of going to that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m00s)

[effort and you're building the bit map](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m02s)

[you're you're basically blitting the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m04s)

[pixels out that you want and you're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m06s)

[writing the render threads you're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m09s)

[managing all of that it's not exactly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m11s)

[trivial](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m13s)

[uh yeah I have a status page where all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m16s)

[of the stats are updated the the same](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m19s)

[time but it flashes on some PCS yes so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m21s)

[that will often happen if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m24s)

[have a lot of datab binding stuff all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m27s)

[triggering at once because typically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m31s)

[when you because if you think about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m33s)

[behind the scenes what's happening you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m35s)

[still have a UI thread that's sitting in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m37s)

[that Loop processing like wind proc](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m39s)

[messages for doing the paints when you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m41s)

[update your zamel stuff with Bindings](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m43s)

[that will trigger an invalidation right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m45s)

[you can call call invalidate on your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m47s)

[zaml elements and that effectively sets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m49s)

[the Dirty Bit to say hey this thing's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m52s)

[been invalidated please repaint me yada](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m54s)

[yada yada](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m57s)

[right um but once it goes to repaint](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h16m58s)

[that's where you start to get that flash](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m02s)

[so if you have a bunch of Bindings that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m03s)

[actually all update at the same time](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m05s)

[that can certainly cause a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m08s)

[non-clean](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m11s)

[flash um some of the ways around it can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m13s)

[be adjusting the level of where the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m17s)

[bindings are at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m19s)

[because updating like the text property](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m21s)

[of a text block is very simple updating](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m23s)

[a Content property or any Bindings that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m26s)

[might cause um layout](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m29s)

[changes um are a are a big deal right so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m33s)

[if you're if you're binding and using a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m37s)

[data template that is going to cause a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m39s)

[much bigger uh effect to your to your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m42s)

[render and layout passes than just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m45s)

[binding the text property on a text](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m47s)

[block uh sometimes you can can mitigate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m49s)

[the flashing as well by uh dealing by](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m51s)

[making sure you aren't doing double](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m54s)

[updates like if you're setting a binding](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m56s)

[to empty string and then to the new ones](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h17m57s)

[uh 50 text bindings are are they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m00s)

[straight to text blocks or or is there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m02s)

[anything extra that's happening and are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m05s)

[any of the bindings in like style](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m07s)

[triggers are similar because it it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m09s)

[definitely possible text blocks](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m12s)

[okay that's shouldn't be that big of a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m15s)

[deal](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m19s)

[the other thing that you could look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m21s)

[is where they are set in terms](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m24s)

[of their](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m27s)

[containers um occasionally I need to add](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m30s)

[a button okay you may look at the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m32s)

[containers as well because if things are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m36s)

[updating and they're like for example if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m39s)

[you've got a bunch of text blocks inside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m42s)

[of a stack layout for example um when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m44s)

[you invalidate that in order to measure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m47s)

[it it has to look at the stack panel to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m49s)

[know how much space to give each of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m52s)

[those even though you may know hey I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m54s)

[just changed one character the actual](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m56s)

[rendered size isn't going to change it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h18m59s)

[still has to go to that parent to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m01s)

[calculate it because the size of that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m03s)

[text block affects everything Below in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m04s)

[the stack panel so there there are times](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m06s)

[like that where if if you are able to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m09s)

[restrict the amount of size changes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m13s)

[because for for WPF there is the um the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m15s)

[measure pass the layout pass and then it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m20s)

[paints right so if you can make the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m22s)

[measure pass quicker because for example](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m25s)

[if you're inside of a a a canvas canvas](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m29s)

[is one of the fastest containers because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m32s)

[it literally doesn't care about anything](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m34s)

[right it's not positioning things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m37s)

[everything's absolutely positioned it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m40s)

[fast it's also like the most painful](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m42s)

[thing to use because everything's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m46s)

[absolutely positioned whereas like grid](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m47s)

[and and stack panel they all have to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m50s)

[like figure out where things go so if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m52s)

[you can cut things off at certain levels](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m54s)

[by setting like Min widths Max widths or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h19m57s)

[or or fix widths or similar to try to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m00s)

[get those things closer sometimes that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m03s)

[can also affect your performance because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m04s)

[then it doesn't have to measure near as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m06s)

[much it can be isolated to where it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m09s)

[the other thing that you can sometimes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m12s)

[do and this sounds really weird to a lot](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m13s)

[of people is actually delay the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m15s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m19s)

[So like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m21s)

[um you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m23s)

[do rather than updating everything at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m26s)

[once sometimes changing a small number](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m28s)

[of things actually makes it feel faster](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m30s)

[than changing everything all at once so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m33s)

[it it kind of it can change a little bit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m40s)

[way](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m40s)

[um uh sorry one second uh let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m43s)

[today](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m47s)

[um though I am being reminded I did](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m53s)

[mention last week that uh tonight was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m55s)

[supposed to be uh doing some AI work and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h20m57s)

[unfortunately I I didn't say this the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m01s)

[beginning my colleague was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m04s)

[not ready for tonight so he he requested](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m05s)

[a delay so I I will see if that means](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m09s)

[next week or not but it is on the docket](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m13s)

[we will be doing AI](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m15s)

[stuff soon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m18s)

[the the the idea of building so for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m22s)

[people who are unfamiliar the goal is uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m24s)

[actually that um that uh GitHub repo](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m28s)

[that I linked a minute](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m32s)

[ago this actually has a little bit data](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m34s)

[in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m37s)

[it uh if we look in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m39s)

[here this is a folder of markdown](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m42s)

[documents with hyperlinks about every](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m46s)

[two to 4 seconds or so so of every one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m49s)

[of my YouTube videos for the last](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m52s)

[several](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m55s)

[years um and so there's there's a lot in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m56s)

[here now admittedly this is using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h21m59s)

[YouTube's uh Speech to Text to to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m01s)

[generate these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m03s)

[things but there is quite a bit in here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m04s)

[and so the goal was to convert this into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m08s)

[my own little chat GPT type bot that is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m11s)

[uh using something called uh rag to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m15s)

[hopefully help answer some question](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m19s)

[questions as though it has all of my](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m20s)

[knowledge in it since I've conveniently](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m22s)

[captured them in a bunch of videos so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m24s)

[we're going to make a little mibot which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m26s)

[sounds like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m28s)

[fun and then I can you know like spawn a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m29s)

[bunch of instances and make a whole](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m33s)

[bunch of little mes it's like being able](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m34s)

[to clone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m35s)

[yourself uh let's see I was debating uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m36s)

[a switch to using messages for each](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m40s)

[status update would likely delay each](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m42s)

[update a bit uh the aim is that the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m45s)

[source will eventually fire step St](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m49s)

[updates individually is required when I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m50s)

[get to update that code yeah the other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m52s)

[thing too izy that that I've done on](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m54s)

[some apps](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m56s)

[is almost like a message board uh type](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h22m58s)

[pattern where when the update comes in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m02s)

[it updates a field but there's either a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m06s)

[a background timer or something that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m09s)

[actually goes and just grabs the latest](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m11s)

[value of it so rather than posting every](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m13s)

[single update um through the bind the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m15s)

[the data](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m19s)

[property it only updates those](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m21s)

[properties every so often and and pulls](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m24s)

[them back right because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m26s)

[sometimes if you're firing those things](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m29s)

[so fast it doesn't always end up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m32s)

[mattering because you may send three](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m34s)

[updates but at the end of the day that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m36s)

[um that render Loop is only going to get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m39s)

[to them so quickly right so it's like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m41s)

[sometimes sometimes you can get away](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m44s)

[with that depending on the situation of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m46s)

[what it is like you can think of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m47s)

[building a clock application where you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m49s)

[really only need to update about every](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m52s)

[half a second to have it feel fairly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m54s)

[consistent showing a second hand counter](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m57s)

[all the way](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h23m59s)

[around](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m00s)

[um uh keto bot what is kbo's favorite](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m02s)

[color oh that's a good question I wonder](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m05s)

[if that's in here save that Pikachu](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m09s)

[we'll use that we'll use that as a test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m12s)

[for the bot we'll see how accurate it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m13s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m16s)

[uh oh annoyingly I can't pull it has to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m18s)

[be a push due to diod networking okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m21s)

[that that might be a specific around](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m24s)

[um uh your your particular](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m28s)

[domain okay so the thing I wanted to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m32s)

[show off it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m34s)

[fuchia see that's how we'll know Izzy if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m36s)

[it gets it right or not that's how we'll](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m39s)

[know I will say it is if we're talking](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m42s)

[about what is my visual to-do color 100%](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m46s)

[is fuchsia followed shortly by depending](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m49s)

[on you know which UI framework lime or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m52s)

[the RGB code where it's just Z ff0 Zer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m55s)

[right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h24m59s)

[like that's that's the one okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m00s)

[GitHub actions right as you can see the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m04s)

[material design one and I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m06s)

[to the other side uh has a bunch of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m07s)

[different actions or workflows as they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m10s)

[call them and we've got ones that are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m12s)

[like kind of interesting right we've got](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m15s)

[this nightly release one that every](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m17s)

[night you can see it just it just bing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m19s)

[bing bing uh m is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m21s)

[coffee oh I love it Pikachu I love](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m25s)

[it the um so this thing just fires off](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m28s)

[and runs and you can see some of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m34s)

[are really quick because this pipeline](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m36s)

[checks to see if there's changes and if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m39s)

[there's not it just stops and you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m40s)

[see the there are no changes takes you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m42s)

[know somewhere between 14 and 30 seconds](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m45s)

[give or take and when there are updates](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m48s)

[it takes like 13 minutes to actually run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m50s)

[but it then goes and actually produces](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m53s)

[preview nougat packages pushes them out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m54s)

[and everything's happy right and we've](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m56s)

[got the standard like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h25m58s)

[um uh the main PR pipelines and the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m02s)

[build pipelines that that run when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m08s)

[things merge and all that stuff so that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m10s)

[that's great right all that's fine](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m11s)

[here's what bothers me I have this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m14s)

[production release workflow and it is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m16s)

[lovely production release workflow aside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m19s)

[from one teeny wheaty little thing the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m21s)

[fact that these are all red X's now](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m23s)

[despite them being all red X's this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m27s)

[thing mostly works so if we take a look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m29s)

[at it it does a little bit right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m32s)

[so yeah so it's got some steps it does](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m36s)

[some work there's some things here right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m40s)

[so it looks up what the appropriate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m42s)

[version numbers are because bear in mind](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m45s)

[this is a pipeline that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m46s)

[automatically kicked off if I run it the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m48s)

[first thing it ask me to do is type in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m51s)

[milestone that I that I want to publish](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m53s)

[so when I'm putting PRS and issues into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m56s)

[a milestone that's why that's important](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h26m57s)

[because that Milestone I'm going to type](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m00s)

[in here and it's going to use that for a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m02s)

[bunch of stuff right so if we if we go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m04s)

[and look it's going to it's going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m07s)

[figure out appropriate version numbers](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m09s)

[for me it's going to generate my release](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m11s)

[notes because I'm way too lazy for that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m12s)

[stuff right it's going to do the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m15s)

[build-in test step because you know we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m17s)

[should actually probably you compile the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m19s)

[thing we're going to release maybe maybe](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m21s)

[right it's going to verify that the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m24s)

[version numbers that it calculated](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m26s)

[actually match the Milestone because if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m28s)

[they don't I have it stop me so just by](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m30s)

[convention I like to have my Milestone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m33s)

[names match the version that's going out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m36s)

[right so the last Milestone was 5.1.0](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m39s)

[that's the version that got published if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m41s)

[those things don't match you know the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m43s)

[pipeline stops you and whacks you upside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m45s)

[the de and says you [ __ ] go fix it um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m47s)

[it calculates the icon changes I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m50s)

[know if anybody actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m52s)

[cares only it it only ever comes up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m54s)

[every so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m57s)

[often but you'll note I've got this pack](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h27m58s)

[icon changes I have a list of every icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m02s)

[not looking but do some of these launch](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m27s)

[okay at least some of these launch but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m30s)

[we generate a list of every icon change](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m32s)

[that has occurred at each version](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m36s)

[because for semantic versioning normally](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m38s)

[a change in I in the icon zenom would be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m41s)

[considered a breaking API change and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m44s)

[require a major version rev I am not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m46s)

[going to rev my major vers version every](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m48s)

[single time just because we have an icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m50s)

[change so as my compromise I said I am](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m52s)

[ignoring icon changes for the purposes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m55s)

[of semantic versioning and instead what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h28m57s)

[I will do is I will produce a list of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m00s)

[all of the changes including the number](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m03s)

[of removed icons I can tell you which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m05s)

[icons have visual changes because I know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m08s)

[what the um the path data was on the old](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m11s)

[version through the new one because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m15s)

[sometimes the icon visually changes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m17s)

[and I don't have any control over that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m21s)

[because we we're just ingesting icons](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m23s)

[from materialdesign icons.com wait like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m26s)

[there's no I'm not building these these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m28s)

[are just being pulled in so but it also](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m30s)

[shows you the new ones and occasionally](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m34s)

[the old ones and occasionally people](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m36s)

[will go well hey where did my icon go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m37s)

[it's like I'm sorry they removed it like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m40s)

[at One release they dropped all icons](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m42s)

[that were uh for Branded ones and they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m44s)

[mve those out I'm and people were like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m47s)

[really like I could grab the old ones](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m51s)

[but now I'm trying to do this weird](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m54s)

[maintaining thing it's like it's just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m55s)

[not worth it so there are other icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h29m57s)

[libraries this is just a reasonable set](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m00s)

[that we pull in and these things merge](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m02s)

[in there's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m04s)

[a also because I'm also lazy right there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m07s)

[is a icon update one that runs daily and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m11s)

[goes off and downloads all of the the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m16s)

[icon updates and if it finds icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m18s)

[updates it opens up a PR and there's an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m21s)

[automatic merge process that as long as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m24s)

[the pipeline passes the icons just Auto](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m26s)

[merge so I haven't thought about](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m28s)

[icon finally it comes in here and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m42s)

[creates a draft release and then it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h30m44s)

[this environment over here on the right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h31m00s)

[is production and production requires an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h31m03s)

[approval and so I have to manually go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h31m06s)

[which is what's making me immediately](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h46m03s)

[suspect of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h46m05s)

[this because we did have a major version](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h46m07s)

[this because this is executed in the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h46m35s)

[my script in it so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h56m59s)

[boah uh let's see let's fix this thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m03s)

[um fixing missing pack icon Wiki](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m08s)

[changes clearly not a lot of people look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m13s)

[at them because no one reported this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m16s)

[since the 5 release so that's how](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m17s)

[valuable these are to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m21s)

[people either that or people just don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m23s)

[know they're there probably a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m25s)

[combination of both okay now if we go to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m27s)

[the wiki and we go to pack icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m29s)

[changes we can goop yay shows to 49 to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m32s)

[50 shows to 50 to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m38s)

[51 there we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m41s)

[go there we go icon changes abound yeah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m43s)

[like for example when we went to 5 that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m47s)

[like these ones were deleted now I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m50s)

[suspect given these ones here they were](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m55s)

[probably collapsed into these other ones](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h57m58s)

[but that's hard for me to say because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m01s)

[without visually inspecting the icons](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m02s)

[before and after it's real difficult to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m04s)

[tell it's real difficult okay so that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m07s)

[fixes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m11s)

[that okay that that passed after a rerun](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m13s)

[which concerns me but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m16s)

[okay fine okay next thing we want to fix](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m19s)

[Milestone and we are going to actually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m34s)

[run this sucker to make sure that it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m37s)

[gets all the way through which is why I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m38s)

[haven't closed the Milestone manually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m40s)

[yet because I want my script to do it uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m41s)

[okay so we tried to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m44s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m48s)

[this so this is using a GitHub extension](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m52s)

[to do it I kind of wonder if I need to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m55s)

[use an extension anymore or if we can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h58m58s)

[get away with this without](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m01s)

[me get a fresh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m09s)

[terminal and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m11s)

[let's okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m15s)

[uh there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m18s)

[uh let's take a quick Gander about this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m22s)

[do does this have a self updator built](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m29s)

[guy just want to make sure I'm on latest](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m56s)

[here real quick because before so this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=02h59m58s)

[um GitHub CLI is a somewhat new thingy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m00s)

[put my big head over here um and so it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m04s)

[been slowly getting more and more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m08s)

[functionality added to it but I think at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m10s)

[this point it's pretty close](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m12s)

[to like I I think they up to everything](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m15s)

[that existed and then it was just a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m18s)

[matter of getting what didn't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m21s)

[exist but if you launch your terminal](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m26s)

[into a GitHub repository you then don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m29s)

[have to specify the extra arguments to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m32s)

[tell it about which account which repo](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m34s)

[whatever because it just defaults to if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m36s)

[your current directory is the root of a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m38s)

[GitHub repo it just uses that which is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m40s)

[kind of convenient okay uh let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m44s)

[okay so we are interested in knowing if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h00m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m12s)

[Milestones where where do you have the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m13s)

[mil Stone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m17s)

[stuff is this is an extension so I'm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m20s)

[intentionally ignoring this one for the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m23s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m25s)

[but well maybe we go that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m28s)

[route](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m31s)

[um and let's take a quick look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m35s)

[the this guy here which I believe you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m41s)

[can just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m44s)

[go github.com slash and then usually](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m45s)

[land right on the guy you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m49s)

[want look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m52s)

[that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h03m56s)

[okay yep this was why we went with this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m01s)

[way because it made it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m04s)

[easy it made it easy so it installs the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m06s)

[Milestone pulls the Milestone back](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m10s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m18s)

[see so I'm curious which of these ended](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m20s)

[up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m24s)

[failing this probably doesn't make sense](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m25s)

[but this is possible let's run this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m29s)

[command and see what](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m32s)

[happens okay so that pulled that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m38s)

[back so if we do the full thing to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m43s)

[assign it in all right so we'll set the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m46s)

[variable great and then we'll do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m49s)

[Milestone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m51s)

[number and then we will do because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m56s)

[think this is the number we're after](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h04m58s)

[so uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m02s)

[Echo Milestone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m05s)

[number we got 45 great that's kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m08s)

[what we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m11s)

[expected um GitHub Milestone edit milom](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m14s)

[State](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m18s)

[closed did it just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m24s)

[work that would be kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m26s)

[disappointing oh it did hang on reopen](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m29s)

[okay so the command works just fine the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m35s)

[issue is the access token that it has](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m38s)

[been given because this is using uh the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m41s)

[GH access token let's take a look look](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m45s)

[at where that comes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m47s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m51s)

[from okay so we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m54s)

[want let's update version numbers close](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h05m57s)

[Milestone so this guy here is just using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m01s)

[the uh builtin access](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m05s)

[token uh let's see doing an issue](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m09s)

[this was closed a while back uh let's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m20s)

[see this is in version 2.1 is this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m23s)

[released yes how do you see the version](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m30s)

[I do GH](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m34s)

[Milestone help can I get the version of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m36s)

[this look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m39s)

[that this is 2.0 so 2 one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m44s)

[is not what I have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m49s)

[but if I run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m52s)

[this do I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m55s)

[get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h06m58s)

[uh do I get an update uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m02s)

[upgrade](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m09s)

[boom okay so I did upgrade](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m11s)

[there and I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m15s)

[is we're also going to change a little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m17s)

[switch here to do uh WR](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m19s)

[poost uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m27s)

[no using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m30s)

[version no you are still](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m33s)

[wrong and then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m38s)

[something of this nature](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m40s)

[GH uh Milestone D- first](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m43s)

[ver right because I think that's what we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m48s)

[just ran](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m50s)

[here yeah so if we just to confirm this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h07m56s)

[line and I think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m00s)

[is we're going to actually spin](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m02s)

[ourselves using](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m03s)

[version](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m06s)

[uh uh extension version there okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m08s)

[we're going to do that just so that we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m12s)

[have that information so this clearly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m13s)

[works with and we don't need to do this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m16s)

[checkout](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m18s)

[anymore um I think we don't need to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m20s)

[the checkout as long as we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m23s)

[specify](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m28s)

[well let's leave that there for now one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m30s)

[one thing at a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m33s)

[time okay so I would like to create a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m35s)

[new workflow file that closes the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m38s)

[Milestone so we're just going to do this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m40s)

[all right and we're going to come over](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m42s)

[here and let's just duplicate uh maybe](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m44s)

[we do this in vs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m46s)

[code let's go here here file open m vs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m49s)

[code then we're going to go expand out](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m56s)

[GitHub workflows and then maybe like our](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h08m59s)

[icon update one is an easy one uh copy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m03s)

[paste um P that sounds great okay so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m08s)

[we're going to come in here and we are](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m13s)

[going to paste](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m15s)

[all of this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m17s)

[in uh that is not what I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m20s)

[wanted I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m23s)

[wanted](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m27s)

[nope I wanted here I wanted](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m28s)

[copy I wanted here I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m33s)

[wanted paste okay we don't need a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m37s)

[needs uh we don't need to run in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m41s)

[production we're just going to try to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m44s)

[rock and roll this guy workflow](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m46s)

[dispatch and then I think what we're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m51s)

[going to do is we are going to do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m54s)

[uh because this was inputs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h09m57s)

[Milestone I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m01s)

[replace inputs Milestone](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m03s)

[with uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m07s)

[5.1 1.0 we're going to save ourselves](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m10s)

[some trouble because we're just testing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m13s)

[this this is all around this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m14s)

[access](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m18s)

[token I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m19s)

[think um and let's go back and confirm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m22s)

[real quick because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m26s)

[think that's what it said it would](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m28s)

[use oh look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m34s)

[that GitHub](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m37s)

[token that is GH token](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m44s)

[bet you that makes a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m50s)

[difference uh bet that makes a big](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m53s)

[difference reading documentation for the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h10m58s)

[win uh okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m02s)

[so well let's let's test this first to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m08s)

[make sure this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m12s)

[works uh so we're just going to send](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m15s)

[this and we are just going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m18s)

[to see test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m21s)

[closing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m25s)

[Milestone see let's just confirm that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m27s)

[this guy here he is workflow dispatch he](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m29s)

[has this he has this he has this commit](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m31s)

[we are just going to send this straight](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m35s)

[into](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m37s)

[Master uh token like the thing I needed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m39s)

[to set up get Kraken uh yeah to some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m41s)

[degree depending on how you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m44s)

[authenticated so in this case um when](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m45s)

[you see Pat what this stands for is not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m49s)

[Patrick but personal access token so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m52s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m55s)

[GitHub right if you go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h11m59s)

[here here and I'm just going to drag](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m02s)

[this to the side real quick because I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m05s)

[don't know what I'm about to show so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m06s)

[we're just going to pause for a minute](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m08s)

[while I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m10s)

[validate and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m13s)

[yeah so it's going to be something like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m20s)

[this so underneath your settings there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m22s)

[on the left side at the very bottom](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m25s)

[there's developer settings which I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m26s)

[always found funny because developer](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m27s)

[settings like how many people use GitHub](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m29s)

[who aren't I know there's some like data](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m31s)

[scientist people but whatever right so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m33s)

[you can generate a personal access token](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m36s)

[or Pat um for the GitHub API there is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m38s)

[this fine grain access token which is uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m42s)

[very similar where you get to Define](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m45s)

[exactly which permissions that it gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m49s)

[when you're running a GitHub action](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m51s)

[there is an access token that gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m54s)

[automatically generated for you that the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m55s)

[GitHub action Runner can use the problem](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h12m57s)

[is is that uh access token that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m00s)

[automatically generated for you by](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m03s)

[definition only has read access to your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m05s)

[repository which is a good thing because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m09s)

[if you think about what could go wrong](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m11s)

[with like pull requests uh um in an open](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m14s)

[source repository if that access token](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m18s)

[had full permission to do things like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m20s)

[delete the repository change somebody's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m22s)

[access to the repository that would be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m25s)

[bad and scary because then somebody](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m26s)

[could open a poll request and the little](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m28s)

[poll request Runner could go and do bad](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m30s)

[things that would not be good uh so the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m32s)

[the workaround for this is we don't have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m37s)

[any actions that trigger based upon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m40s)

[outside uh contributor AC or outside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m43s)

[people's actions](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m46s)

[with an elevated access token so like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m48s)

[for example this one that closes](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m50s)

[Milestones it only runs in the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m52s)

[production](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m54s)

[environment and the only way something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m55s)

[runs in the production environment is if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m56s)

[somebody clicks the approved button](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h13m58s)

[manually and there's only three of us so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m00s)

[it can only go wrong so many ways](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m03s)

[somebody would have to sneak in a change](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m05s)

[to a yaml file without us reviewing it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m07s)

[and then somebody to run uh a pipeline](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m09s)

[build and click approve without catching](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m12s)

[it I accept those risks uh okay so we're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m15s)

[going to go actions here and now I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m19s)

[should have oh shoot I just realized](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m22s)

[something I didn't change the name of it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m24s)

[I don't know which one of these icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m27s)

[updates it is this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m29s)

[one let's run this I I I'm hoping that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m32s)

[this works the reason that they both](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m36s)

[show up as icon update is because uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m37s)

[when I created this test. yaml I left](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m41s)

[the name as icon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m44s)

[update it should really be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m46s)

[Ted that way it makes a little more](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m49s)

[sense okay so this guy ran closed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m51s)

[Milestone and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h14m59s)

[hopefully](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m01s)

[issues Milestone closed okay so the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m03s)

[issue is that that guy and we are going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m06s)

[to just reopen this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m09s)

[guy uh hang go back to Milestones go to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m11s)

[closed real open okay so the last thing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m15s)

[I want to test on this guy here to make](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m18s)

[sure that we can set it properly is I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m21s)

[don't want to set this up up here um I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m23s)

[believe you can set environment down at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m26s)

[a lower scope um specifically down](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m28s)

[here we can double check that assumption](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m33s)

[here in just a moment but I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m36s)

[believe is that off by one yeah it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m41s)

[off by one](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m44s)

[uh yaml is everybody's favorite as it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m47s)

[wh space sensitive and you have to get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m49s)

[it exactly correct but I believe this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m51s)

[also works so we're going to confirm](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m53s)

[this as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m55s)

[well uh test amend uh no we won't amend](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h15m57s)

[the commit uh testing moving](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m01s)

[EnV um I could go look at the docs for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m05s)

[what the context supports were or I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m09s)

[could just push this and run it and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m10s)

[confirm it so I kind of like I kind of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m12s)

[like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m14s)

[just go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m15s)

[right so these are open actions we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m19s)

[should now have test](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m21s)

[huzzah it's cool that it remembers that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m23s)

[it's the same file just a different name](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m26s)

[okay so if I run this now it should kick](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m29s)

[off and we should see it close and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m31s)

[everything should be happy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m33s)

[so that would be nice if that were as](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m36s)

[simple as the change was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m44s)

[okay it went Green Let's just check the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m51s)

[results Milestone closed okay so what we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m55s)

[are going to do then is we are going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h16m58s)

[to copy these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m00s)

[changes back into our main release](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m04s)

[one Bo and we're going to just do that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m08s)

[and that will make all of that happy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m13s)

[okay that problem is now](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m15s)

[fixed next](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m18s)

[one next one that's not fixed is okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m20s)

[and both of you can cancel I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m24s)

[don't like we don't need to be wasting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m26s)

[build](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m28s)

[minutes okay uh on the production](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m30s)

[release the last step that failed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m35s)

[because I'm I'm doing these as separate](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m37s)

[pipelines because I like the number of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m39s)

[times I run this thing full end to end](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m42s)

[is not high](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m44s)

[enough okay so this is pushing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m45s)

[changes so this guy](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m51s)

[here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h17m58s)

[um should have had because the token](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m00s)

[that is in that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m03s)

[secret so what is what maybe is not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m05s)

[obvious is if we look at secrets and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m08s)

[variables](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m10s)

[actions there's that access token right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m12s)

[so there is a service account access](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m16s)

[token to be able to do all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m19s)

[we have generated one that gets uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m22s)

[stored](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m26s)

[uh interesting just got an email from](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m28s)

[Azure saying sorry to see you go don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m31s)

[worry Azure I didn't go anywhere uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m33s)

[let's see I feel like the answer is here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m35s)

[but I'm not quite getting](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m37s)

[it take a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m39s)

[look Maui interface theming](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m42s)

[come on Microsoft load](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m47s)

[load you can do it you can do it I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m51s)

[believe in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m54s)

[you come](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h18m59s)

[on do not understand why these learn](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m01s)

[links are giving me such](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m04s)

[problems there we go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m11s)

[boy maybe I should go back to net Escape](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m14s)

[Navigator it's coming all the way from](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m17s)

[Australia uh let's see okay so load a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m20s)

[theme at runtime remove the current](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m23s)

[theme from the app uh property load the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m25s)

[selected theme this is achieved by](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m29s)

[adding an instance of the selected theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m31s)

[to the merge](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m33s)

[dictionary property of your top level](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m35s)

[resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m38s)

[yes okay so the the idea here is inside](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m41s)

[of your Maui application you have an](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m45s)

[app.](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m47s)

[zaml your app. zaml contains um a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m49s)

[collection of merged resource](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m53s)

[dictionaries uh and in this case very](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m56s)

[similar to how the material design](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h19m58s)

[Library Works where I created typed](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m00s)

[resource dictionaries I will admit I may](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m02s)

[have poached a little of my structure](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m04s)

[from Maui uh because not everything they](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m07s)

[do is bad some of the stuff is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m10s)

[decent so what this is doing is it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m12s)

[grabbing that collection of merged](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m14s)

[dictionaries dumping it so this is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m15s)

[type of code that you might write if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m18s)

[were trying to go from light to dark](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m20s)

[theme right or I guess in theory if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m22s)

[were trying](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m25s)

[to um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m26s)

[automatically like set the Dark theme in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m29s)

[code at runtime right you've persisted a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m31s)

[user settings that says Hey I want to be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m34s)

[dark theme and you want to do this the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m36s)

[one bit about this code that is absolute](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m39s)

[trash in my opinion is this line right](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m42s)

[here um because because this throws away](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m45s)

[every single resource every single](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m47s)

[merged in resource dictionary you have](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m50s)

[at the app level uh if all you have at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m51s)

[the app level is theming this is fine](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m54s)

[the moment you do anything else this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m56s)

[code doesn't work because it's blindly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h20m58s)

[clearing everything which is wrong um in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m01s)

[general what you would probably want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m04s)

[do is Loop over this merge dictionaries](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m06s)

[collection and and be somewhat](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m09s)

[intelligent about which ones you remove](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m11s)

[and which ones you drop right so if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m13s)

[you've got a resource dictionary called](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m16s)

[say light theme you might Loop over all](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m18s)

[of the merge dictionaries and go oh okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m21s)

[maybe we only remove the light and dark](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m24s)

[theme dictionaries from the collection](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m26s)

[and not just blindly dump](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m28s)

[everything um let's see does it go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m30s)

[here oh I might have to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m34s)

[uh grab](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m37s)

[this let's see uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m40s)

[application current user app Theme so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m44s)

[this is fine here in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m48s)

[that this is setting AP them light ape](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h21m57s)

[dark um this is a slightly different](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m01s)

[property let me let me check this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m04s)

[here is this in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m06s)

[here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m12s)

[um sorry I don't remember remember these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m14s)

[apis off the back of my head user app](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m16s)

[Theme gets the currently requested Theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m23s)

[by the system for your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m26s)

[application oh so what is what is going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m29s)

[to probably break you here this is a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m33s)

[readonly property so think of um this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m35s)

[property as telling you what theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m39s)

[the um the device is currently in not](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m43s)

[necessarily uh what theme you want it to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m49s)

[go](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m53s)

[into right so like on Android you can](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m53s)

[you can pick whether you want your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m57s)

[device in light or dark theme this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h22m58s)

[going to return back either light or](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m01s)

[dark or unspecified is likely a value](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m03s)

[reserved for we we just don't know we](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m06s)

[give it up but it's working um if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m09s)

[have an assignment the the fact that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m12s)

[here where's this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m15s)

[the fact that this shows an assignment](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m17s)

[operator here I'm skeptical at it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m18s)

[working just doesn't sync between](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m22s)

[runs I'm the reason I'm skeptical that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m26s)

[it's working is because this thing here](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m29s)

[shows that the property should be readon](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m32s)

[if there's a Setter I imagine it's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m35s)

[probably not doing anything if you want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m37s)

[to actually persist this between runs](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m40s)

[you're probably going to end up having](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m42s)

[to persist the user selection between](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m44s)

[light and dark um and then do something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m48s)

[Dynamic I'm actually surprised that this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m53s)

[works because that would mean that this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h23m59s)

[swaps](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m01s)

[the is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m06s)

[there I'm I I am somewhat surprised that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m13s)

[that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m16s)

[works look here respond to system theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m28s)

[changes yeah so because this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m31s)

[is oh set the current user](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m34s)

[theme oh look at](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m38s)

[that so you can set it this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m43s)

[way oh this is interesting it just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m51s)

[doesn't sync between runs yeah so that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m54s)

[the fact that it doesn't sync between](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m57s)

[runs sort of makes sense this is going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h24m58s)

[to be setting something](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m01s)

[that or how should I phrase this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m04s)

[typically if you want something to sync](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m08s)

[between runs you're going to end up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m10s)

[needing to actually save some data and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m12s)

[reload that properly](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m14s)

[uh hey Alex uh we we're on a side](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m16s)

[tangent at the moment about doing some](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m20s)

[theming in net Maui um but there's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m22s)

[little bit of GitHub actions work um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m26s)

[that uh we were going to jump back to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h25m30s)

[see where is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m09s)

[the persist data I thought there was a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m12s)

[an implementation for configuration but](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m45s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m46s)

[Essentials like why are some of these](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m53s)

[Microsoft learn links making me click](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m55s)

[multiple times it's just the Microsoft](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h26m57s)

[Pages umm extensibility blah blah](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m03s)

[blah see where are you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m07s)

[because the the simple the the dead](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m17s)

[simple way to do it is just like write](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m19s)

[your own config file so net Maui has a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m21s)

[uh file](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m26s)

[system uh API that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m27s)

[is uh it's an abstraction because the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m30s)

[file system that you access on like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m34s)

[Android is different than Windows which](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m36s)

[is different than](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m37s)

[iOS so they do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m39s)

[have this guy here um and specifically](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m41s)

[if you wanted to be able to like write](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m46s)

[off what theme that you wanted to save](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m49s)

[and sync it between runs you can write](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m52s)

[files off into like your cache directory](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m54s)

[right you can open up a streamwriter and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h27m57s)

[just blindly write a file that contains](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m00s)

[you know user theme](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m03s)

[preference and then when your app starts](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m06s)

[up read in said file and set the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m09s)

[theme um I thought there was a better](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m13s)

[configuration API that handled some of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m18s)

[this for you but I could just be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m21s)

[wrong um so this is the this is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m24s)

[the the the simple way of doing it and](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m28s)

[just going Bare Bones very simple if you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m32s)

[want structured data you could use](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m35s)

[something like um system text. Json to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m37s)

[write out a Json file with the config in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m39s)

[it and serialize deserialize that way](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m42s)

[but like I said or the the dead simple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m45s)

[way is just string uh um streamwriter](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m48s)

[and just write a file make it a text](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m52s)

[file put a one for for dark zero for](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m55s)

[light or something like you can make it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h28m59s)

[that level of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m02s)

[simple because I'm not seeing a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m03s)

[configuration thing in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m06s)

[here figuration management](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m13s)

[yeah yeah and that's the thing is it is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m19s)

[just stor aou like I said write a write](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m20s)

[a one or zero into the file and then](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m23s)

[read it back and forth oh dear](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m25s)

[Heavens this is what it is preferences](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m31s)

[that's that's the API see I knew I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m35s)

[remembered seeing](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m37s)

[something yeah this this this is the](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m43s)

[API there that way you don't have to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m48s)

[think about where it gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m50s)

[stored yeah this is this is what I was](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m56s)

[remembering is there's a very there's a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h29m59s)

[very simple API when you just want to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m01s)

[store like user preferences right you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m03s)

[give it a name you give it a value you](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m07s)

[can store](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m09s)

[Bulls](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m10s)

[um and typically what you would do is](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m12s)

[you declare a constant for whatever your](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m15s)

[your thing is going to be like I don't](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m17s)

[know user theme or something to that](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m19s)

[effect rather than has pets and you just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m21s)

[make sure that you use the constant in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m24s)

[both places Bippity bity boo yah you're](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m26s)

[done and then you can just interact with](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m30s)

[this the same way that you would a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m33s)

[dictionary and this guy will be](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m35s)

[persisted](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m39s)

[um yeah help Store app preferences in a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m43s)

[key value store so it's a very simple](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m46s)

[thing and then you don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m48s)

[about where where it ends up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m50s)

[going](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m54s)

[um and if you are interested right there](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h30m56s)

[it does integrate with the apple and iOS](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m00s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m04s)

[yeah yeah and it is worth noting th](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m08s)

[because this is why you generally want](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m11s)

[to go through this rather than just](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m13s)

[writing your own file because like](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m14s)

[uninstalling the app would remove it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m16s)

[unless you're on Android 6.0 API level](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m18s)

[23 or later with auto backup feature](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m22s)

[like there's all these weird cases of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m24s)

[stuff like that when you do](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m27s)

[crossplatform stuff it just gets weird](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m28s)

[it just gets](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m31s)

[weird okay](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m32s)

[okay okay so we wanted to push this up](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m37s)

[and for updating the version numbers I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m41s)

[am willing to bet if](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m45s)

[we if we run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m47s)

[this this will probably](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m50s)

[work let's see what are the variables in](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m54s)

[here that are being](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m57s)

[used](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h31m58s)

[um there are none it just increments so](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m03s)

[if I pull this out right and I take this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m06s)

[guy up to the rout and I go hey give me](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m10s)

[a new file that's not at the root that's](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m13s)

[not what I asked for do what I said uh](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m15s)

[test uh PS1 right if we just slap this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m18s)

[into here if I were to run](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m21s)

[this I should](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m25s)

[see a file](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m28s)

[change um specifically in the GitHub](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m31s)

[workflows get](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m34s)

[versions I don't see a file change to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m40s)

[which is not great API](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m43s)

[03:32:55,399 --> 03:33:00,000](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m46s)

um which probably means there's not

[enough output of this thing oh I](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h32m57s)

[probably need to save the file for it to](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m00s)

[do something let's try let's try this](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m01s)

[again this time with the file content](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m03s)

[saved that that makes a much better](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m05s)

[thing okay so it did rev the versions](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m08s)

[and it did set the versions inside of](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m10s)

[here properly so that's the entire point](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m12s)

[of this Powershell script is after a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m14s)

[release I want to bump all the versions](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m16s)

[up so that my nightly release picks up a](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m18s)

[bumped version number all right and it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m21s)

[always just bumps up the minor because](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m24s)

[there are no changes yet and then it](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m26s)

[leaves it up to me to actually you know](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m28s)

[be intelligent about when to bump other](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m29s)

[things we revert](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m31s)

[this okay so the question then is why](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m34s)

[did my permissions fail when I ran said](https://youtu.be/554ZaFJxeDM?t=03h33m38s)
