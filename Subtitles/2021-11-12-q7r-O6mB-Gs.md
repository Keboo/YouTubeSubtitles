[hello everyone welcome back oh i missed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m02s)

[my audio there we go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m05s)

[that down just a tad](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m07s)

[so uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m10s)

[tonight i am hoping to finally get that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m13s)

[uh pull request in that i've been](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m15s)

[working on for the last couple streams](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m17s)

[with the thieving brushes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m18s)

[i've been a little distracted with uh a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m20s)

[couple other projects i've been working](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m22s)

[on so i haven't had a lot of time to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m23s)

[poke at this between streams but i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m25s)

[hoping we can wrap it up today or at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m27s)

[least get it far enough to merge it so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m31s)

[i made a just kind of jotted down a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m32s)

[quick list and i think in terms of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m34s)

[getting it merged i think we could](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m35s)

[actually probably do it pretty quick um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m37s)

[it's not a degradation for either of the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m40s)

[bugs that we saw but i was hoping to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m42s)

[kind of wrap those up so the the two](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m44s)

[bugs in question were the the shadow](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m45s)

[with the cards that is missing um as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m48s)

[well as the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m50s)

[uh theme color of the dialogue host so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m52s)

[those were the two known issues that i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m55s)

[was aware of so i figured we would try](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m57s)

[and attack those so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h00m59s)

[let's dive back in and i will](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m02s)

[recall where we left off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m05s)

[so we fire this guy up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m06s)

[and we will see what we can do i am](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m12s)

[going to shut down some stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m14s)

[thankfully i was able to order a new](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m19s)

[hard drive so the out of out of hard](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m21s)

[drive space issue that we were fighting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m24s)

[last time](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m25s)

[that will go away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m26s)

[in about four days](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m28s)

[so hopefully and then there will be a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m33s)

[full reinstall machine wipe and all that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m35s)

[jazz](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m38s)

[okay so let's start with dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m39s)

[hostess](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m40s)

[that one we didn't look into before um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m45s)

[that one doesn't count this one so this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m47s)

[is so this here is the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m50s)

[and we only kind of briefly took a look](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m52s)

[at it um so in short the issue is i see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m54s)

[no text](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m57s)

[that's a problem so if i come over here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h01m59s)

[though and i toggle because i have a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m00s)

[strong](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m02s)

[there's text](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m04s)

[so what i can tell right out the gate is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m05s)

[what is happening is this dialog is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m08s)

[being displayed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m11s)

[the theme text color is making it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m12s)

[through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m15s)

[but the background is not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m16s)

[so something is off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m18s)

[because we shouldn't be letting half of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m20s)

[the theme through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m22s)

[so we are going to track down where that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m23s)

[is and i think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m25s)

[see that one's fine there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m27s)

[it goes away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m31s)

[and this one's probably easier because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m33s)

[it's contained to this this one here i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m35s)

[know is up higher up so let's see if we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m36s)

[can track this down and figure it out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m39s)

[so i'm pretty sure if i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m42s)

[just from doing that theming toggle i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m44s)

[pretty sure what i know what i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m46s)

[find so when i look at this text block](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m48s)

[here and i look at foreground](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m50s)

[right so i see that it's tied to the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m52s)

[material design body brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m54s)

[and i know that this guy here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m56s)

[immediately toggles you see the material](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h02m58s)

[design body switches to the dark theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m00s)

[which when you're on a dark background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m04s)

[white font that's helpful we like that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m06s)

[you know nice contrast this no contrast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m09s)

[to the point where it's invisible](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m14s)

[so let's start working our way up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m16s)

[so fun thing you can do in snoop is uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m20s)

[you can use a pipe right here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m23s)

[uh let me just check make sure i got my](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m25s)

[got my stuff fired up so i do not have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m27s)

[car neck running i do not have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m30s)

[zoom it running there we go so fun thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m33s)

[you can do here is you can do a pipe](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m35s)

[and we can do like foreground back](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m38s)

[so you'll note i don't even bother to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m40s)

[to do all of the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m42s)

[the whole word right i just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m44s)

[i just kind of type it and it figures](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m47s)

[out and goes you know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m49s)

[substring matching and so i can find all](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m51s)

[of the things that have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m54s)

[foregrip and back in it which is really](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m55s)

[kind of convenient](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h03m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m01s)

[and so in this case what i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m03s)

[is to figure out where that background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m05s)

[is getting set at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m07s)

[so we just keep going up the food chain](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m10s)

[until we find it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m12s)

[i have a hunch i know where it's going](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m13s)

[to be because you see this guy's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m15s)

[transparent which that isn't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m18s)

[so this guy here so part pop-up content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m19s)

[element](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m22s)

[background there and i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m23s)

[believe i just want to confirm what i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m26s)

[think i know this guy over here because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m29s)

[you'll see how this guy floated it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m30s)

[because this is a pop-up control](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m32s)

[this one over here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m34s)

[not a pop-up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m37s)

[but you'll note it has the same problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m39s)

[and it might be mildly easier to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m43s)

[track](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m45s)

[simply because it is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m47s)

[it is embedded inside of the main visual](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m51s)

[tree so rather than having to jump](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m53s)

[visual trees but it's got the same bug](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m54s)

[so whatever's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m56s)

[whatever is doing the brush dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m58s)

[toggle is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h04m59s)

[is our problem child](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m01s)

[so i imagine if i go here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m03s)

[you'll see it's the same same problem so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m07s)

[this dialog background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m09s)

[is white](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m12s)

[in light theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m13s)

[and apparently](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m16s)

[does not change in dark theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m21s)

[which then begs the question](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m26s)

[there is a what is it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m28s)

[uh there's like a theme something or](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m31s)

[another see don't even need to know the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m34s)

[name of it theme assist inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m36s)

[dialogue theme is set to inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m41s)

[so the fact i will say that the but when](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m44s)

[this thing is set to inherit i expect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m46s)

[the whole theme to propagate down](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m48s)

[i don't expect this garbage](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m51s)

[so something is not appropriately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m53s)

[populating background theme all the way](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m56s)

[down](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m58s)

[because because the text foreground is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h05m59s)

[populating down but text foreground's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m02s)

[kind of a special one it's usually less](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m04s)

[problematic it normally it's designed to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m06s)

[propagate down foreground colors are](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m09s)

[kind of built for that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m11s)

[background's a little trickier](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m12s)

[and clearly the source of our problems](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m18s)

[short version this part pop-up content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m19s)

[element](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m23s)

[is the source of our issues so we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m24s)

[gonna go to the theme project](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m27s)

[we're going to go into themes we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m30s)

[going to go into dialogue host](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m32s)

[oh so those for anybody unfamiliar with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m34s)

[the material design library this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m36s)

[material design themes wpf this is your](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m38s)

[meat and potatoes this is where all the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m40s)

[cool stuff is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m42s)

[um and then more specifically and any](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m43s)

[xaml themes so styles content templates](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m45s)

[all that stuff lives under the themes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m48s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m50s)

[not to be confused with what will become](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m51s)

[a theme folder shortly](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m54s)

[am i not on the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m56s)

[i must not be on my theme bro i'm on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h06m59s)

[master good to know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m01s)

[we'll fix this guy on master and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m02s)

[we'll circle back to it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m08s)

[this bug clearly exists in both places](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m11s)

[okay so this is the default dialog host](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m14s)

[that uses a pop-up but we know it exists](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m16s)

[in both so we're going to pick on this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m18s)

[one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m19s)

[hey metal slug how you doing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m21s)

[we are](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m24s)

[we are tracking down this annoying](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m25s)

[annoying dialogue host bug so even](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m28s)

[though the dialogue or the uh the theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m30s)

[is set to inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m32s)

[the foreground color inherits the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m34s)

[background color does not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m35s)

[which is not good](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m37s)

[so let's see what we can find out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h07m39s)

[you get the radius side i get the desert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m14s)

[okay we're gonna just drop this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m16s)

[okay so this overlay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m19s)

[yes it is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m40s)

[so for anybody not familiar with the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m46s)

[everybody's usually familiar with the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m48s)

[seattle area which has a notorious](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h08m50s)

[stops and you start getting the pretty](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m03s)

[uh like what people think of with the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m05s)

[pacific northwest forest](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m09s)

[basically when you drop right out of the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m10s)

[desert down the hill you're dropping](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m12s)

[right into spokane so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m13s)

[which can be for some great pictures](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m16s)

[if you hit it right at sunrise but that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m19s)

[requires being awake and driving at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m21s)

[sunrise which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m23s)

[that has its own set of problems](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m24s)

[so dialogue background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m27s)

[where](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m29s)

[so you are my problem child](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m30s)

[where do you come from](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m33s)

[who sets this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m36s)

[show me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m39s)

[somebody in here is setting this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m40s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m43s)

[those are the bindings that are using it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m44s)

[so that's expected](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m46s)

[it's telling me unset no no no no no](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m52s)

[that can't be right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m54s)

[that that can't be right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m56s)

[that can't be right at all](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h09m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m02s)

[what](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m04s)

[let's try this let's expand it i i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m06s)

[expected it to be in the that project](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m09s)

[but let's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m11s)

[let's find out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m16s)

[i am really confused because i expected](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m25s)

[this to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m28s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m33s)

[so nothing's setting it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m40s)

[i mean that would explain why it seems](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m44s)

[to always have the background property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m45s)

[color of white let's just confirm that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m48s)

[it is actually true white](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m49s)

[yeah so it is true white](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m51s)

[so nothing's setting it which is why](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m54s)

[it's always white okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m56s)

[that is the reason for the bug now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h10m59s)

[we should fix this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m02s)

[okay so step one step one i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m04s)

[write a test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m06s)

[because this is the type of thing that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m08s)

[there should be a test for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m09s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m11s)

[we're gonna leverage](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m12s)

[the nice little test project that i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m15s)

[wrote and we are going to put a ui test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m16s)

[together real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m19s)

[for it um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m20s)

[so let's start with this uh fact](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m29s)

[public](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m30s)

[facing task okay that's a little creepy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m32s)

[stop typing everything for me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m38s)

[dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m40s)

[parrots theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m45s)

[background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m48s)

[because when the dialogue host is set to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m50s)

[inherit i really do expect that to flow](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m52s)

[through so let's see what do we need](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m54s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m55s)

[um i don't think we need much of this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m56s)

[let's grab this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h11m59s)

[i think we have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m02s)

[i thought i had one for each](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m04s)

[yeah whatever](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m09s)

[yeah let's just grab this and we'll get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m13s)

[it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m15s)

[let it this much of it so that's going](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m16s)

[to go like that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m17s)

[so let's see i don't need two dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m19s)

[hosts i'll take](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m21s)

[oh i see this is loaded this is doing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m23s)

[both dialog hosts in one shot oh that's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m24s)

[actually kind of convenient](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m26s)

[we're going to keep that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m30s)

[so this will this confirms that we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m31s)

[actually can set the dialog background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m33s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m36s)

[this is probably the one that broke it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m38s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m48s)

[let's look at pr22](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m49s)

[i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m52s)

[bet you this is the pr that broke the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m53s)

[that broke it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m56s)

[because i'm willing to bet what happened](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h12m58s)

[is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m00s)

[it was going along nicely and then we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m02s)

[added in a property to configure it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m05s)

[i think i may have been the one to do it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m08s)

[oh no but i definitely merged it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m12s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m16s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m18s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m20s)

[yeah there's a test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m21s)

[there's the property there's the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m23s)

[background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m24s)

[yeah so this thing wasn't being set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m31s)

[before](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m33s)

[oh you know what i bet you we can do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m36s)

[hang on before writing this test i bet](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m38s)

[you already know the fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m40s)

[i bet you the fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m43s)

[it's that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m47s)

[i bet you let's just test that real](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m50s)

[quick because i'm i'm willing to bet](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m51s)

[because that one's sitting on top and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m53s)

[blocking the background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m54s)

[that the correct colors probably set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h13m57s)

[higher up because this bug did not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m00s)

[previously exist](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m01s)

[and actually we can mull it out too](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m08s)

[that's another option we might look at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m12s)

[that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m14s)

[that might be a cleaner approach rather](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m16s)

[than using transparent](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m17s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m20s)

[yeah transparent is not the right option](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m28s)

[let's see hot reload](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m36s)

[see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m41s)

[hot reload is awesome when it works](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m42s)

[i just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m45s)

[especially with wpf stuff if there's a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m46s)

[lot of cases where it doesn't quite work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m48s)

[right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m50s)

[at least i don't think that was correct](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m53s)

[i don't i assume noel would have given](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m55s)

[me a different option](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m57s)

[uh let's see dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h14m59s)

[let's try it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m01s)

[no that is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m11s)

[i do think null is probably the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m21s)

[appropriate default here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m23s)

[well here let's let's start with this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m27s)

[let's go back to the test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m28s)

[okay so this is here we're going to get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m32s)

[rid of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m34s)

[this and i would like to explicitly set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m35s)

[the that what is the theme property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m38s)

[dialog theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m41s)

[that's what i want to set so i want to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m43s)

[explicitly set dialog theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m44s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m46s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m48s)

[okay so we'll put let's put a little](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m51s)

[space in between these because i can't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m53s)

[read that as easy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m54s)

[give me a little white space a little](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m56s)

[white space](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m57s)

[uh let's see get rid of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h15m59s)

[we've got dialog host one dialog host](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m02s)

[two grid grid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m04s)

[great some text](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m06s)

[some text](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m08s)

[bubble bomb okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m11s)

[this is actually convenient because we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m14s)

[can steal a lot of this code](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m16s)

[we can actually do a bunch of this stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m24s)

[here so this is test test test get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m26s)

[background color this is asserting that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m28s)

[both of them get the appropriate one now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m31s)

[what i'd really rather do here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m34s)

[is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m36s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m38s)

[get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m40s)

[there's a i wrote a helper for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m41s)

[theme brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m48s)

[that is not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m51s)

[what is that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m54s)

[simple test makes sense there is a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m56s)

[there's a get theme brush or similar](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h16m59s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m01s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m06s)

[where is the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m09s)

[get resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m13s)

[i'll remember the name of my own method](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m15s)

[so contrast ratio get background color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m18s)

[where is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m23s)

[think it's get resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m32s)

[i think is what it is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m35s)

[let's just try that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m38s)

[i think that's what it is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m40s)

[so it would be something like uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m42s)

[dialogue host one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m44s)

[get resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m46s)

[yeah and so we want to pull back](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m49s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m53s)

[in the case of inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m55s)

[we expect it to be the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h17m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m01s)

[what is this thing going to load up for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m02s)

[the window initialize material design](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m04s)

[uh base theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m09s)

[primary color so it's deep defaulting to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m12s)

[purple and lime](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m16s)

[uh where is the window](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m18s)

[just past it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m23s)

[create window with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m25s)

[create windows so this is using](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m28s)

[background of paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m30s)

[so we want to assert that our background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m33s)

[is equal to material design paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m35s)

[so start here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m37s)

[so let's see material design paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m45s)

[did i not give myself the not a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m49s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m57s)

[i should have given myself a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h18m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m02s)

[paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m05s)

[oh this needs to be weighted](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m08s)

[paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m15s)

[get as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m16s)

[solid color brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m22s)

[let's see our](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m27s)

[paper brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m30s)

[oh something like that so that'll do the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m32s)

[type cast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m34s)

[oh uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m36s)

[typing op](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m39s)

[okay so that gives me the brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m41s)

[so what i want to assert is that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m43s)

[both of these cases](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m46s)

[paper brush dot](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m48s)

[is equal to those](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m51s)

[let's start with this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m56s)

[cert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m57s)

[not null](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h19m59s)

[paper brush color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m02s)

[i guess we just really need a certain](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m05s)

[one paper brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m07s)

[color is a struct and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m08s)

[because it doesn't know anything about](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m12s)

[that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m13s)

[use the no forgiveness operator](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m15s)

[uh something like that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m18s)

[so i want to catch it about here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m21s)

[let's just debug this test real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m24s)

[so for anybody who might not be familiar](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m28s)

[with this this is a library called xaml](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m30s)

[test that i wrote](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m32s)

[specifically to be able to test themes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m34s)

[and styles because there's not a great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m36s)

[phrase i couldn't find a great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m39s)

[testing library to do that kind of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m41s)

[testing everything's designed either](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m44s)

[around unit testing or ui testing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m46s)

[which is fine-ish](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m49s)

[except for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m51s)

[unit testing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m54s)

[doesn't really work because you need ui](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m56s)

[threads](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h20m58s)

[and you really need the whole wpf](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m00s)

[rendering stack to accurately test like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m01s)

[a control or a style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m04s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m06s)

[ui testing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m07s)

[gets a little too high up because it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m09s)

[designed to simulate user interaction](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m10s)

[which means getting things like a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m13s)

[background brush is hard](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m15s)

[which i didn't like that either so i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m17s)

[wrote my own library](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m18s)

[okay so paper resource found a resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m20s)

[great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m23s)

[if i jump over it did it give me a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m24s)

[okay good so it did retrieve the right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m27s)

[color okay and then continue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m28s)

[and then hopefully the test fails](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m33s)

[which it does](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m36s)

[okay good this is this is a good thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m38s)

[test should start in a failing state](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m40s)

[so expected that actual null perfect so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m43s)

[it's behaving as we expect perfect go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m46s)

[away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m49s)

[okay so when this test passes we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m50s)

[probably pretty close to done](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m51s)

[hard part](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m55s)

[accomplished](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h21m59s)

[so how about this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m01s)

[dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m03s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m05s)

[background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m08s)

[should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m11s)

[inherit the background i think we should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m14s)

[be a little more clear on what the end](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m15s)

[goal actually is okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m18s)

[given that so if we come back here so if](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m21s)

[the goal is to make sure that this thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m23s)

[follows the appropriate background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m25s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m32s)

[i i'm trying to decide what the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m37s)

[appropriate default should be i think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m39s)

[null given that this thing is set here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m41s)

[however](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m44s)

[however](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m45s)

[i think what we should probably do is up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m47s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m50s)

[we should do a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m51s)

[default so setter property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m52s)

[dialog background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m56s)

[value](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h22m58s)

[should default to the dynamic resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m00s)

[material](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m03s)

[design paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m05s)

[right boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m07s)

[that should go like that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m08s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m11s)

[we should do it on the other one too](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m12s)

[that way there is a reasonable default](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m16s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m18s)

[and i think this will work with dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m24s)

[theme inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m26s)

[i don't know if that for a fact](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m29s)

[so uh oh oh what am i doing what am i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m32s)

[doing why am i launching the app i've](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m34s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m35s)

[got it i've got a pretty little unit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m36s)

[test that i wrote](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m38s)

[unit test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m40s)

[uh most people would not consider this a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m41s)

[unit test since it you know starts a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m43s)

[whole new wpf process](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m45s)

[so there's that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m48s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h23m56s)

[go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m00s)

[look at that look at that we're fixing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m02s)

[bugs](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m04s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m06s)

[now we'll come in here and test it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m08s)

[dialogues so if i pop this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m10s)

[that looks better](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m13s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m16s)

[love it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m18s)

[and these work then more importantly if](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m21s)

[i go back to light theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m23s)

[go back to light theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m25s)

[that both of them work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m29s)

[everyone said oh i didn't realize that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m31s)

[that's funny](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m34s)

[i just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m36s)

[i expected this pop-up to get grayed out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m37s)

[but it makes sense why it doesn't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m40s)

[it's weird because of the layering of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m42s)

[the dialogue hosts the the two hosts are](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m44s)

[underneath the dialogue because these](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m48s)

[are both pop-ups](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m50s)

[but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m52s)

[but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m54s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m55s)

[can get grayed out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m56s)

[because this is not a pop-up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h24m59s)

[look at that look at that the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m01s)

[interaction just works](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m02s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m04s)

[okay and then i want to just double](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m06s)

[check](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m08s)

[because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m09s)

[we conveniently have this test up here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m11s)

[that validates that we can](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m13s)

[actually change the background so let's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m15s)

[validate that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m17s)

[look at that look at that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m20s)

[you know what let's just run all the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m24s)

[dialogue host](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m25s)

[just make sure we haven't broken](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m27s)

[there's something very satisfying about](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m40s)

[watching those tests run there's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m41s)

[something very satisfying](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m43s)

[they fire up they do clicky clicky](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m46s)

[clicky](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m47s)

[they do all the things they validate all](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m49s)

[the stuffs](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m51s)

[and it works it just works](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m52s)

[that's what we like to see that is what](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m56s)

[we like to see okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h25m58s)

[i'm trying to think if there's anything](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m02s)

[else that needs to be tested oh i do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m03s)

[want to know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m06s)

[i'm trying to think of how to do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m12s)

[test appropriately but let's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m14s)

[let's do one more test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m18s)

[i think we'll bring it down here i want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m21s)

[to make sure that this doesn't break](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m22s)

[when the dialog host isn't set to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m25s)

[inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m27s)

[oh because that's actually interesting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m31s)

[this thing is set to inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m33s)

[so i guess this doesn't matter because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m36s)

[it'll always line up with paper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m38s)

[but when it's set to light over dark](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m42s)

[i guess that's still going to work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m55s)

[actually you know what let's do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h26m59s)

[theory](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m03s)

[uh inline data](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m06s)

[uh base theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m09s)

[we're just gonna do them all inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m11s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m15s)

[dark](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m16s)

[light so we'll just test all of the base](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m18s)

[themes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m20s)

[so we'll do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m25s)

[dialog theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m26s)

[and i think we just changed the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m27s)

[assertion up a little bit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m29s)

[so this becomes that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m31s)

[which means i need to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m34s)

[this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m36s)

[and which means i need to escape that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m38s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m41s)

[and then this needs to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m44s)

[become uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m46s)

[dialogue theme okay so that goes like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m49s)

[that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m51s)

[oh i need to escape the x-statics as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m52s)

[well](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h27m55s)

[okay so that goes there that goes there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m03s)

[that goes there i think that's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m05s)

[good](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m08s)

[good good good oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m09s)

[in case](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m11s)

[people haven't caught it uh net six](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m12s)

[officially released](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m15s)

[vs 2022 officially released i'm on i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m16s)

[still on the preview i just rev to the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m20s)

[next preview one which they always put](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m21s)

[out a a preview one that's right after](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m23s)

[the ga release which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m26s)

[usually is effectively basically the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m28s)

[same thing as the ga with the preview](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m30s)

[flag on that's it so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m31s)

[what it's worth that's there go and get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m34s)

[it it is awesome](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m36s)

[uh i love it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m40s)

[yes typey typey typey so um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m43s)

[at least from what i've seen let me see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m47s)

[if i can find it real quick i i've got](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m52s)

[it's over](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m54s)

[where did i do it where did i do it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m56s)

[see if i can find it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h28m58s)

[i get it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m01s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m02s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m03s)

[on one of my other libraries where i was](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m04s)

[uh multi-targeting oh let me see if i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m06s)

[can find the one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m08s)

[where's the one where the test actually](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m10s)

[pass](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m12s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m13s)

[passing tests are cooler](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m15s)

[it was cool to kind of just see because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m16s)

[this is the same 39 tests with the only](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m18s)

[change being the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m20s)

[the framework version so you can see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m22s)

[full framework four seven two four eight](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m24s)

[net core three one five oh six so and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m27s)

[you can see the the performance right so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m30s)

[we start it slow at four seven two which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m33s)

[is the oldest](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m35s)

[one nine which is four eight which is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m37s)

[kind of like net core app two one i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m39s)

[think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m41s)

[um and then we go to net core app three](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m42s)

[one it drops a little bit net five at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m44s)

[least my 39 tests don't see a major](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m47s)

[performance in the net six](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m49s)

[another performance game](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m51s)

[like this is not great benchmarking but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m53s)

[it's nice to see the trend it's nice to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m55s)

[see the trend](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m57s)

[so for what it's worth your code may be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h29m59s)

[faster](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m02s)

[just by revving your target framework](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m03s)

[version](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m05s)

[so uh and also to go along with that c](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m07s)

[sharp 10 goodness which is great um i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m10s)

[will probably be revving the lang](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m13s)

[version in this project](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m14s)

[at some point in the near future i try](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m16s)

[not to do it right away to avoid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m19s)

[breaking people](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m20s)

[but be aware that the dev tools for this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m22s)

[library](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m24s)

[are always going to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m25s)

[typically latest and greatest](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m27s)

[so we'll still target older frameworks](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m29s)

[so people can still consume the library](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m31s)

[but if you want to actively dev on it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m34s)

[you will need to at least pull like 20](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m36s)

[22 community um in order to do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m37s)

[stuff so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m40s)

[and i do try to make sure that nothing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m42s)

[in the library](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m44s)

[needs anything beyond community open](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m45s)

[source projects](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m47s)

[thrive on community contributions so it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m49s)

[shouldn't need upper skus](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m56s)

[uh okay so we're gonna change this so if](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h30m57s)

[we do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m00s)

[this assertion is good ish](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m04s)

[this asserts that it will match the the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m07s)

[theme brush which i believe this will](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m09s)

[pass let me just confirm that real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m11s)

[because this should now run through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m16s)

[three times](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m18s)

[that was interesting that i didn't see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m25s)

[it go dark mode](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m27s)

[sorry i'm gonna just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m41s)

[let's do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m45s)

[margin](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m51s)

[i just want to make sure we actually see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m53s)

[because right now this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m55s)

[this little thing is taking up the full](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m57s)

[space of the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h31m58s)

[dialogue and i don't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m04s)

[run test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m05s)

[and i want to see that dark color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m06s)

[showing through on the back](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m08s)

[because i want to prove that we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m09s)

[actually hitting what i think we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m10s)

[hitting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m12s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m16s)

[that's not a good see this is why we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m19s)

[write tests](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m21s)

[this is why we write tests okay so my](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m22s)

[test is gonna fail](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m24s)

[but that's good it'll be in a failing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m26s)

[state we'll go fix that bug](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m28s)

[so what i would like to assert on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m30s)

[is this text block](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m34s)

[uh it doesn't show it here so we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m36s)

[gonna just grab this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m38s)

[we'll come down here and we will do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m40s)

[text block one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m43s)

[home](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m46s)

[text block two](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m48s)

[and we will](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m50s)

[just grab that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m51s)

[boom boom two becomes one done](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m53s)

[and then both of these need to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h32m56s)

[text block](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m00s)

[but what i would like to do is my assert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m02s)

[should be uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m05s)

[what is it contrast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m18s)

[what was the theme there's a cert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m20s)

[contrast something or another](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h33m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m19s)

[we'll do double](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m24s)

[minimum](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m26s)

[contrast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m28s)

[ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m30s)

[so we'll do that so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m32s)

[so we're just going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m35s)

[just get rid of small because we don't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m38s)

[need this this will become ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m40s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m43s)

[that guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m46s)

[and then we want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m48s)

[foreground we want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m51s)

[background which means both of you go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m53s)

[away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m56s)

[and then we're gonna do a little assert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h34m58s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m00s)

[and we will do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m02s)

[minimum contrast ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m05s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m10s)

[oh hang on what is this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m16s)

[no so this should be ratio and this here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m21s)

[should be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m25s)

[minimum contrast ratio minus tolerance](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m33s)

[[Applause]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m35s)

[i'm gonna go with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m37s)

[contest ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m38s)

[ratio does not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m40s)

[how about](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m46s)

[less than](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m49s)

[it's a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m58s)

[tolerance](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h35m59s)

[of 0.1](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m01s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m05s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m06s)

[so that's really what i want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m07s)

[uh and i guess this doesn't even need to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m11s)

[be asynctask anymore this is just void](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m13s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m16s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m18s)

[uh color adjust test do we change this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m20s)

[one out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m24s)

[i don't want to mess with this because i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m30s)

[lose that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m32s)

[kind of like the messaging](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m34s)

[but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m36s)

[what i do want is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m40s)

[material](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m41s)

[design spec](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m43s)

[insert contrast ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m46s)

[okay foreground is going to be a weight](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m48s)

[uh text box](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m52s)

[on get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m54s)

[foreground color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h36m56s)

[await](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m00s)

[text](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m01s)

[block one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m03s)

[get](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m04s)

[uh effective background so this thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m06s)

[will actually get effective background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m08s)

[is kind of a best guess](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m10s)

[um it walks up the visual tree and tries](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m12s)

[to determine what the background color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m14s)

[is for an element it will completely](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m16s)

[fail um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m18s)

[if you use like layout transform and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m20s)

[shift things around and the the actual](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m22s)

[thing that's behind it isn't the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m24s)

[straight up thing in its um visual tree](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m26s)

[but for most of the time it's it's okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m32s)

[so here uh we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m36s)

[we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m38s)

[and actually you know what we're gonna](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m42s)

[do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m43s)

[i normally don't like doing this but i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m44s)

[think this is actually good use for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m46s)

[using static](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m48s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m50s)

[using static](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m51s)

[uh boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m53s)

[so when you do it using static and c](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m55s)

[sharp it lets you access the static](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m57s)

[members](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h37m59s)

[as though they were right on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m01s)

[uh let's see and we're gonna go with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m04s)

[uh minimum contrast small text so you'll](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m07s)

[note i'm accessing static members on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m10s)

[um that other class as though they were](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m13s)

[local to me which is kind of cool the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m15s)

[drawback is obviously readability can](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m17s)

[tank](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m20s)

[so don't don't use it when readability](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m22s)

[tanks](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m24s)

[so like a lot of features they can be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m26s)

[abused don't do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m28s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m30s)

[color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m33s)

[foreground one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m35s)

[and actually i guess this thing is gonna](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m38s)

[want to be that right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m39s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m42s)

[that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m46s)

[uh that is that is the wrong four](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m48s)

[f-o-r-e there we go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m52s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m56s)

[and we're just gonna throw some asserts](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h38m59s)

[on here real quick to make sure that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m00s)

[these work so assert](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m02s)

[not null](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m08s)

[foreground one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m08s)

[round two okay and then we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m12s)

[the same thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m14s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m16s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m17s)

[we'll just do that level of assertion](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m18s)

[and actually we're gonna bring](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m21s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m38s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m40s)

[two](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m42s)

[two](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m44s)

[okay now this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m45s)

[should fail on dark right now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m48s)

[because right now what should happen is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m51s)

[because that dark color isn't being](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m53s)

[applied](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m54s)

[it should just break now the fun part](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m55s)

[with inherit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h39m57s)

[is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m00s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m02s)

[so i expect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m05s)

[okay so let's just confirm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m08s)

[confirm what i think i know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m11s)

[okay so not surprised that inherit fails](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m14s)

[oh inherit past](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m18s)

[light failed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m20s)

[that is surprising to me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m22s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m24s)

[uh why is life failing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m30s)

[i'm gonna actually move these things out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m47s)

[of this weight because this isn't adding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m49s)

[any value](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m51s)

[and let's dial this thing down to just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m56s)

[light real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h40m58s)

[so we don't think about much](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m00s)

[and then i am curious to see what this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m03s)

[thing comes up with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m05s)

[so debug test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m07s)

[see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m18s)

[foreground should be close to black](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m20s)

[background should be close to white](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m22s)

[so move you off to the side](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m24s)

[so foreground](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m26s)

[that's pretty close to black](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m28s)

[and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m31s)

[oh i guess background is a async call so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m32s)

[we gotta step in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m34s)

[uh let's do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m39s)

[hey](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m40s)

[where's my little](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m41s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m43s)

[uh run the cursor](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m44s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m47s)

[i don't know about you but that looks](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m55s)

[pretty darn close to me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h41m56s)

[what does it come up with as a ratio](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m00s)

[20.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m02s)

[assert true 20](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m05s)

[is greater than 4.5 minus](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m08s)

[1.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m11s)

[that is a true](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m13s)

[statement okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m14s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m19s)

[should be the same values](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m20s)

[oh that passed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m28s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m31s)

[wonder what happened the first time i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m33s)

[wonder if it's because i had everything](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m35s)

[inside that weight](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m37s)

[so we're just going to run the test real](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m45s)

[quick because i i do expect dark to fail](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m47s)

[and inherit to conditionally fail](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m50s)

[because inherit will then depend on the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m54s)

[state of the system](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h42m56s)

[okay that's at least i think closer to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m03s)

[what we expect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m05s)

[dark and inherent](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m07s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m09s)

[so my system is in dark mode doesn't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m10s)

[shock me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m16s)

[still a little surprising but this is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m19s)

[close to what we expect let's fix dark](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m20s)

[mode and then we'll](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m22s)

[we'll deal with inherit since it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m23s)

[conditional](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m28s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m29s)

[where should this be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m34s)

[so how should this actually work when](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m37s)

[you change that dialog host theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m39s)

[let's take a look](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m42s)

[the dialog theme dialog theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m46s)

[there's that there's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m50s)

[that uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m52s)

[trying to remember where this gets](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h43m59s)

[controlled at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m01s)

[show it to me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m03s)

[don't care about demo app](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m05s)

[too much uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m08s)

[i'm gonna ignore tests for the moment](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m10s)

[there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m13s)

[ah it goes through the theme assist](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m18s)

[and if i recall correctly](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m23s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m25s)

[this guy's got some magic in him](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m27s)

[okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m30s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m33s)

[when you change the theme he swaps out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m34s)

[the resource dictionaries](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m36s)

[so he goes hunting for one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m42s)

[that match is based on uri](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m49s)

[and then pulls that out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h44m53s)

[so it goes hunting for the light and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m01s)

[dark dictionaries pulls them out of the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m02s)

[merged dictionaries if it finds them](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m04s)

[and then goes through and adds in the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m07s)

[appropriate one as necessary](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m09s)

[makes sense](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m14s)

[so when that is set to an explicit value](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m18s)

[what does that end up doing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m23s)

[to the color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m27s)

[because these guys here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m36s)

[the problem is is this this dynamic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m44s)

[resource is going to resolve](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m46s)

[outside of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m48s)

[which is a teeny bit problematic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h45m54s)

[this is a teeny bit problematic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m04s)

[because this guy down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m11s)

[right his background isn't going to use](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m23s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m24s)

[this for for example the pop-up has the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m25s)

[theme assist brush here specified](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m27s)

[which is going to do the merge](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m31s)

[dictionary](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m32s)

[mungine on the pop-up which is good](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m34s)

[means all the brushes inside the pop-up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m37s)

[will resolve with that theme's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m39s)

[dictionary perfect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m40s)

[the problem is is this background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m43s)

[isn't resolving with a dynamic resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m46s)

[which means this text element](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m48s)

[will pick up the change from here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m50s)

[this one won't or i'm sorry the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m54s)

[background won't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h46m57s)

[but the text elements in the foreground](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m00s)

[will](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m03s)

[so what is the appropriate way to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m05s)

[resolve this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m07s)

[so the fix that we put in a second ago](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m08s)

[for the background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m10s)

[we could cheat](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m16s)

[trying to decide what's the appropriate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m26s)

[way to to handle it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m28s)

[does it make sense](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m32s)

[i'm halfway tempted to use like a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m40s)

[priority binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m42s)

[you never use one of those things](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m45s)

[is that the right answer though because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m48s)

[what we've got is a case where we wanted](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m49s)

[to use the theme colors](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m52s)

[unless a dialog background has been](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m54s)

[explicitly set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h47m57s)

[and the only issue we have is the theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m05s)

[assist can't be set up at the dialog](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m07s)

[host itself because it's a container](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m10s)

[control](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m12s)

[and this dialog theme is expected to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m15s)

[limited in scope to the dialogue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m18s)

[so i'm thinking what might need to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m23s)

[happen](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m25s)

[just thinking out loud here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m26s)

[is maybe something like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m28s)

[i don't know we abused the tag property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m36s)

[or similar right we could go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m38s)

[we could go tag property here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m43s)

[and draw and so we'll just bring in the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m44s)

[template binding like this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m47s)

[so that we have it stored somewhere and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m51s)

[then use a fallback down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h48m53s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m01s)

[does this thing have a style on it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m03s)

[or is the style all set higher](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m06s)

[he doesn't have a style does he](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m10s)

[so we couldn't do like a trigger on this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m13s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m15s)

[that might not be a bad i like the style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m18s)

[triggers better than a priority binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m20s)

[i just don't like priority bindings](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m22s)

[there uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m24s)

[maybe that's maybe that's the the way to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m28s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m30s)

[is rather than getting too fancy we do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m34s)

[it with a style trigger](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m36s)

[on the cards](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m38s)

[probably not a bad way of handling it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m41s)

[yeah let's do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m45s)

[okay i think i talked myself into it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m47s)

[talk to myself into it uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m49s)

[wpf](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m54s)

[card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m55s)

[uh style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m56s)

[bum](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h49m58s)

[style target type](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m00s)

[let's see card boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m02s)

[and then this is a key one that a lot of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m04s)

[people forget about](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m06s)

[is if you don't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m08s)

[uh if you go through and create a style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m10s)

[without doing it based on you're just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m13s)

[straight up overriding what was there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m15s)

[previously which is typically not what](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m16s)

[you want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m18s)

[typically not what you want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m20s)

[so you want to base it on the original](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m22s)

[or based on what it what was being](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m25s)

[applied previously and in this case](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m27s)

[because there was no explicit style set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m29s)

[it was](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m31s)

[inheriting based upon an implicit style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m32s)

[which is keyed on the type so we do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m34s)

[static resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m36s)

[using a key of the type because that's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m38s)

[what the implicit style would result](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m40s)

[okay so i don't think we're going to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m44s)

[need this let me get rid of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m46s)

[so down here i think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m48s)

[do is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m50s)

[style trigger and the key thing with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m51s)

[triggers is the the value thing that you](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m54s)

[compare against has to be a constant so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m56s)

[in this case we have to compare against](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m58s)

[null so we're gonna do uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h50m59s)

[i can do a straight trigger](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m06s)

[and let that still be a template binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m09s)

[or do i do a data trigger](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m13s)

[which one's better](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m18s)

[as a trigger means i have to store it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m21s)

[somewhere first](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m22s)

[which is a which is an option](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m25s)

[i don't really like that option](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m36s)

[it's actually not that bad](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m40s)

[so if we do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m42s)

[right we'll just do a tag](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m44s)

[so if tag](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m46s)

[value](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m48s)

[is null](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m50s)

[all right so in the case where the tag](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m53s)

[values go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m55s)

[setter](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m57s)

[property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h51m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m01s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m02s)

[background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m04s)

[value gets](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m06s)

[dynamic resource and this is where we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m08s)

[gonna go back up to the top here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m10s)

[and grab this so we're gonna whack these](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m12s)

[guys](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m15s)

[back down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m17s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m19s)

[so now because this is resolving the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m20s)

[dynamic resource from inside the card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m22s)

[when the dynamic resource walks up the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m25s)

[visual tree when it gets to the pop-up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m27s)

[the magical theme dictionary that got](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m29s)

[inserted by this attached property will](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m31s)

[be there it'll resolve appropriately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m32s)

[what we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m38s)

[want to do here though](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m42s)

[we want to default this guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m44s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m49s)

[tag uh oh i'm sorry relative source](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h52m58s)

[self](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m03s)

[trying to do its tag property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m05s)

[so we'll default the background to the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m07s)

[tag property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m10s)

[get rid of this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m12s)

[the tag property will have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m16s)

[a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m18s)

[i wonder why that had to be like that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m23s)

[i oh this can't just be a template](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m26s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m28s)

[this should be known at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m30s)

[compile time](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m32s)

[yeah that should be fine](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m36s)

[so the tag will get updated with the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m38s)

[dialog background if the tag property is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m40s)

[null then it'll fall back and use the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m43s)

[paper brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m46s)

[otherwise the background will continue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m47s)

[to just be a binding straight to the tag](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m49s)

[so there's gonna be a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m51s)

[double hop there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m52s)

[i think that's okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m53s)

[i think that's okay so this fixes one of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m55s)

[them](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m57s)

[that fixes the root one let's go fix the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h53m59s)

[other one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m01s)

[so we're gonna get rid of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m02s)

[we're gonna actually oh i'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m04s)

[grab that card style because i think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m06s)

[that's pretty much exactly what i want](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m08s)

[so i pretty much want to just duplicate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m11s)

[that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m14s)

[down here since both of these are cards](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m16s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m20s)

[just confirming there's no magical](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m23s)

[style set here it doesn't look like it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m26s)

[i'm gonna grab the tag property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m29s)

[bring that down in place in the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m32s)

[background](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m34s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m40s)

[uh back to the tests](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m41s)

[on test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m45s)

[and it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m47s)

[just works](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m47s)

[at least that's the goal](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m51s)

[should just work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h54m53s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m02s)

[sorry it's on the wrong screen nope](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m04s)

[okay so it failed on that guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m10s)

[let's see uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m19s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m21s)

[that's interesting that it would fail on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m28s)

[that line](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m30s)

[because this is failing online let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m35s)

[what does it say](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m37s)

[00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,599](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m49s)

[this is weird of where it's failing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m54s)

[timeout attempt succeeded](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h55m57s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m04s)

[a little confused](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m07s)

[let's run this one more time just to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m12s)

[confirm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m14s)

[worried that my jiggling of the mouse](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m16s)

[made a difference](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m18s)

[so that's dark so the test failed but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m20s)

[visually that looked fine](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m23s)

[and light failed this time](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m27s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m30s)

[embelli](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m38s)

[because a different thread owns it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m53s)

[oh is this the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h56m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m02s)

[because this is sharing a remote uh this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m07s)

[could be the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m16s)

[is there no](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m20s)

[there's no cash into the windows is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m23s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m26s)

[because i can make this go faster if i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m27s)

[change out the window content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m33s)

[let's look at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m36s)

[yeah that's that's no bueno](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m43s)

[um what is the easiest way to go through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m47s)

[and do this because i would like this to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m49s)

[iterate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m50s)

[i would like this to iterate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m57s)

[how](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m58s)

[do i change this appropriately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h57m59s)

[this exception is weird to me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m02s)

[because this shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m05s)

[wait for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m12s)

[uh let's see this 208](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m15s)

[it's interesting that it seems to think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m24s)

[that the stack trace](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m26s)

[from this guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m29s)

[goes 233 208](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m30s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m35s)

[not sure how that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m36s)

[how it figures that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m38s)

[because that's clearly wrong](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m44s)

[i'm wondering if this weight is actually](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m48s)

[like i know why it's sitting here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m51s)

[because if you go too fast you end up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h58m58s)

[if you go too fast you end up not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m01s)

[getting the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m03s)

[the dialogue elements because they](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m06s)

[haven't been created yet](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m07s)

[let's start with moving that up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m09s)

[and out because that doesn't need to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m12s)

[inside of here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m27s)

[kind of want to change this up a little](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m29s)

[bit and go var](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m31s)

[card one gets](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m33s)

[away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m35s)

[so hang on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m39s)

[we're just going to change a bunch of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m41s)

[stuff real quick because this is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m42s)

[this is a little awkward](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m44s)

[um because we can do weight four](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m46s)

[boom boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m49s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m52s)

[i should make a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m55s)

[helper method to do wait for element](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m56s)

[invisible or something](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=00h59m58s)

[it might be a nice a nice little](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m00s)

[extension](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m02s)

[so if we do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m08s)

[then we come down here this just becomes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m11s)

[dialog pose 2 card 2](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m13s)

[and then we get rid of this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m16s)

[because really all we're looking to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m18s)

[is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m20s)

[make sure that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m21s)

[that we give these um dialogues time to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m26s)

[open but once they open we run fast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m28s)

[let's try that i think that's gonna fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m32s)

[some of the timing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m34s)

[i don't know if it's gonna fix the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m36s)

[spinning](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m38s)

[okay so they all fail immediately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m45s)

[so what is what is it squawking at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m49s)

[solid color brush get color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m52s)

[okay so that's that's helpful](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m55s)

[216. oh is it the resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h00m57s)

[216.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m01s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m10s)

[other theory](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m12s)

[other theory](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m14s)

[do we have an old version of this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m15s)

[01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:27,839](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m20s)

let's just go look at my nougat package

[because i am not hitting this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m25s)

[on a different project where i use this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m27s)

[and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m35s)

[versions](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m36s)

[so there is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m41s)

[several things out here let's just jump](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m44s)

[to the repository i just want to look at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m46s)

[this code really oh hold on hold on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m48s)

[pro tip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m52s)

[when you're at a github repo](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m53s)

[period button](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m55s)

[vs code in the browser](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h01m58s)

[this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m00s)

[is utterly amazing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m02s)

[so it's not quite uh like the the code](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m04s)

[spaces uh you don't get compute bound](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m07s)

[stuff but you even get some extensions](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m09s)

[again some the ones that i like syntax](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m12s)

[highlighting they don't require like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m14s)

[um like for c sharp the whole thing that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m16s)

[needs to spin up like an omni sharp](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m18s)

[process you can't get that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m20s)

[but if you just want to browse a repo](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m23s)

[it's perfect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m29s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m30s)

[windows messenger so i'm really](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m33s)

[interested in the fact that when i call](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m41s)

[so it's really when i call](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m44s)

[get on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m47s)

[the brush so it's specifically 216.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m50s)

[so this guy here when i go get a solid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m54s)

[color brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m56s)

[let's just get resource that's biting me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h02m59s)

[man](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m01s)

[let's take a look because this seems odd](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m03s)

[that it would](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m06s)

[you off to the way](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m13s)

[what is what is this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m15s)

[so get ass should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m29s)

[get as should give me what i expect](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m35s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m39s)

[you are obnoxious okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m40s)

[i wonder if i've got a bug here that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m44s)

[i've just never run into before](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m45s)

[uh internal resource](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m48s)

[uh let's see base values](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m52s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m55s)

[get as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h03m57s)

[uh value is t converted d serialize](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m05s)

[so it should deserialize the object](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m09s)

[down for me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m12s)

[and get it as a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m15s)

[solid color brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m19s)

[okay so let's step over this guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m26s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m38s)

[okay so theory](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m44s)

[theory here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m46s)

[it could be it could still be this but i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m48s)

[i kind of doubt it but i'm willing to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m51s)

[bet if i go paper brush freeze](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m53s)

[the problem goes away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h04m58s)

[because when you freeze a brush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m00s)

[it now knows that it's no longer being](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m02s)

[mutated](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m04s)

[it's running a little faster okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m14s)

[so that's that's better now we're not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m17s)

[blowing up where we thought we were](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m20s)

[excellent we're back to the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m23s)

[back to the previous failure okay and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m24s)

[i'm just gonna i'm just gonna run this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m26s)

[one more time just just make sure that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m28s)

[wasn't a fluke](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m30s)

[okay same result](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m35s)

[excellent okay so now we just have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m37s)

[this guy here the expected value isn't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m40s)

[the one we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m42s)

[we were going for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m45s)

[and i believe](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m46s)

[here you hush](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m48s)

[uh which means i don't need that um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m50s)

[and i believe the issue is where we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m54s)

[pulling this off of because recall this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m56s)

[is pulling the resource as seen from the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h05m58s)

[dialog host control but we know that the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m00s)

[theme assist is setting it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m02s)

[inside so i think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m06s)

[is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m10s)

[look inside](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m13s)

[so we don't want to do dialogue host i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m19s)

[think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m22s)

[is probably card one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m24s)

[and we should probably do it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m29s)

[you should probably do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m39s)

[i just hate doing this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m44s)

[we'll do it it's it's obnoxious i hate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m50s)

[it but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m53s)

[what are you gonna do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m57s)

[even though i know that these should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h06m58s)

[always be the same i just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m00s)

[i worry that they may not always and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m03s)

[because the difference between these two](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m07s)

[dialogue hosts is one's using the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m08s)

[embedded ones using the pop-up and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m09s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m11s)

[been no small number of bugs that have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m14s)

[come up because of that difference](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m15s)

[so that should fix that failure](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m18s)

[then we should have robust tests](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m22s)

[go fast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m29s)

[don't went fast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m32s)

[why are you](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m36s)

[2-0](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m45s)

[interesting i'm wondering if it's going](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m47s)

[too fast](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h07m53s)

[we're just gonna test this real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m02s)

[if i arbitrarily slow this down](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m07s)

[do you pass that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m10s)

[because i'm wondering if it's when it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m13s)

[when it's attempting to read that color](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m14s)

[if it's still animating and so therefore](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m16s)

[there's an opacity](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m17s)

[yeah so that's the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m19s)

[it's reading the color too quickly](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m21s)

[there's an opacity there and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m23s)

[i have to wait for the animation to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m30s)

[finish](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m32s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m40s)

[so what we're going to do is we're going](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m41s)

[to come down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h08m42s)

[we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m00s)

[because i hate putting in an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m02s)

[delays i would rather this thing as soon](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m04s)

[as this thing passes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m06s)

[we're gonna we're just gonna go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m09s)

[there now i shouldn't need the delay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m24s)

[okay so it'll be a slightly slower on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m39s)

[things like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m41s)

[machine running the tests but at least](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m44s)

[they all pass](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m46s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m51s)

[i am](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m52s)

[i am happy with the fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m54s)

[we have a test which means](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h09m56s)

[can reproduce or not that gives me a lot](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m37s)

[of confidence whether this is a a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m40s)

[one-off problem or whether this is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m41s)

[actually something that needs to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m43s)

[looked at so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m44s)

[for what it's worth](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m46s)

[okay so we did that we did that let's go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m49s)

[back to master real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m50s)

[okay next bug](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m53s)

[next bump and we started looking at this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m55s)

[one last time](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h13m57s)

[let's go take a look at this because i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m00s)

[believe it is either the sh i believe](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m02s)

[it's the shadows](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m04s)

[i believe it is the shadows page](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m07s)

[come here so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m10s)

[and this shows up easier if we turn this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m16s)

[off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m19s)

[you can see these buttons here how their](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m20s)

[depth is slowly getting deeper](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m23s)

[right that's nice](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m26s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m28s)

[not so much](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m30s)

[not so much not so much](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m31s)

[uh and that's a problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m34s)

[specifically i broke this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m35s)

[my bad um and if we look at the card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m38s)

[moving this clip up to the root](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m51s)

[and so if we look at the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m53s)

[let's see uh history](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h14m57s)

[so you see this this is the commit here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m07s)

[that broke it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m09s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m11s)

[clip property was set down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m19s)

[which was fine-ish and then i moved it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m25s)

[up to the root grid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m27s)

[now the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m29s)

[is if we go and look at what content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m31s)

[clip does](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m33s)

[so if we come in here and go and look uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m34s)

[oopsie](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m38s)

[content clip is this geometry](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m40s)

[and more importantly content clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m43s)

[gets built up when the card is rendered](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m45s)

[so it does some](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m49s)

[some checking and some corner radius and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m50s)

[builds up this rectangle geometry which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m52s)

[is great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m54s)

[that's kind of what we would what we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m55s)

[would like but the problem is is when i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h15m57s)

[moved it up to this root](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m00s)

[it then also wrapped](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m02s)

[the adorner](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m04s)

[which was a bit problematic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m08s)

[so the bug that i was attempting to fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m10s)

[um and i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m14s)

[does it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m16s)

[give me a good way of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m18s)

[uh 24 54. so let's just go look at that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m22s)

[because i can show the bug off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m25s)

[see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m32s)

[01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,880](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m35s)

54.

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m39s)

[that's the pr](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m40s)

[but here's the issue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m42s)

[so specifically what was happening is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m44s)

[there was a card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m46s)

[and because of the clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m48s)

[and this is specifically because this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m50s)

[card here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m52s)

[um has a it was a padding that was set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h16m58s)

[did](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m01s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m08s)

[because of the padding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m09s)

[uh it was](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m12s)

[being shrunk down and that was causing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m14s)

[the issue](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m17s)

[now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m18s)

[that's annoying and i think both should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m20s)

[work the problem that is occurring](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m21s)

[is up a little bit higher](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m28s)

[to do where am i at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m32s)

[because this is the control template so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m34s)

[this is what's going to be put inside of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m36s)

[the control so when you set something](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m38s)

[like padding on the control you're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m40s)

[actually setting it at this layer up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m43s)

[here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m44s)

[so if we take a look at our trusty with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m46s)

[our trusty friend snoop](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m48s)

[right if we go and look](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m53s)

[so when you set this you'll note here's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m55s)

[here's my card control](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m58s)

[and inside the card i go grid adorner](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h17m59s)

[decorator boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m01s)

[all the way down](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m04s)

[right which is great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m05s)

[it's wonderful](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m09s)

[the problem being](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m11s)

[that when you set the padding your](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m14s)

[padding is going to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m16s)

[inside of this not outside of this so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m18s)

[clipping at this level even though this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m21s)

[is where the grid is the actual card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m23s)

[itself is down here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m25s)

[which is the weird part so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m31s)

[we gotta figure out how to deal with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m34s)

[this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m35s)

[gotta figure out how to deal with this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m38s)

[so the simple solution is i put this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m44s)

[back](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m48s)

[this goes back to feature parity](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m49s)

[but reintroduces the previous bug](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m52s)

[all right so i can come here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m55s)

[and it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h18m59s)

[between between snoop and hot reload i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m01s)

[don't trust that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m04s)

[so the way snoop works is actually](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m07s)

[rather clever](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m09s)

[it actually injects itself into the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m10s)

[running um process space](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m12s)

[of its target app](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m15s)

[starts a thread and then calls itself](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m16s)

[back from that processes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m18s)

[thread that it started](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m21s)

[which means now it's got itself running](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m22s)

[inside of a thread inside of your](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m24s)

[process which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m26s)

[not gonna lie pretty cool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m29s)

[um it's fun repo to look through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m31s)

[so yeah so you'll know as soon as i put](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m34s)

[that back there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m36s)

[because the only thing being clipped now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m41s)

[is the inner content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m45s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m51s)

[so let's set this up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h19m59s)

[such that we can see the air because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m02s)

[right now we can't see the failure case](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m04s)

[let's go to the demo](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m10s)

[shadows](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m14s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m21s)

[and let's pick on not the button](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m24s)

[not the button the card and we want to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m28s)

[pick on the big](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m31s)

[one so we're not going to do this we're](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m32s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m34s)

[so we're going to close that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m36s)

[do that and then we will do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m39s)

[toggle button](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m42s)

[and actually let's just go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m44s)

[toggles](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m48s)

[let's just grab one of these guys](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m51s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m54s)

[because that's that's basically what i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m56s)

[want boom i want one of those](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h20m57s)

[something like that um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m02s)

[i highly doubt that updated correctly](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m06s)

[but let's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m08s)

[one can dream](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m10s)

[look at that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m12s)

[see and you can see right there the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m14s)

[clipping that's occurring](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m15s)

[okay so i don't need to go any further](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m22s)

[problem reproduced i'm going to restart](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m23s)

[because i think that clippings actually](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m25s)

[worse than it should be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m27s)

[i was surprised i was expecting to have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m28s)

[to slide the thing to a corner or](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m30s)

[somewhere](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m31s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m37s)

[uh nope not cards](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m40s)

[i guess that's fine but that's not where](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m42s)

[we want to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m44s)

[and i'm gonna put it back to light mode](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m46s)

[because that's easier to see the shadows](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m48s)

[nope clipping still occurs there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m50s)

[it's interesting i want to look at why](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m53s)

[the clippings down there i expected it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m55s)

[closer on the other edges](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m57s)

[those were the opposite two edges that i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h21m59s)

[expected to see it in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m00s)

[okay so there's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m03s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m19s)

[is there a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m26s)

[oh is the clip properties being set here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m35s)

[yeah there is a clip there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m40s)

[so clip to bounds is definitely not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m50s)

[right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m52s)

[because we want that ripple to spread](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m54s)

[out](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h22m56s)

[we don't want that guy to clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m19s)

[so let's back this guy up a little bit](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m21s)

[so let's put you inside a grid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m27s)

[oh i want to relaunch](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m38s)

[just trying to get myself into a place](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m40s)

[where i fully understand what's going on](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m42s)

[and why this clippings happen](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m43s)

[because i don't get why it's clipping](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m45s)

[the top and the left i expected it to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m47s)

[clip bottom and right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m50s)

[so it's backwards from the expectations](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m52s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m54s)

[that was almost scary](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h23m56s)

[see that is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m05s)

[interesting to me now show me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m10s)

[see there's the toggle button](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m12s)

[there's my grid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m14s)

[so what is the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m19s)

[horizontal alignment stretch](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m24s)

[stretch](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m27s)

[how is this horizontal alignment stretch](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m34s)

[and that and that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m36s)

[something's not lining up here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m38s)

[margin 32 where is that coming from](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m48s)

[that ah that's why](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m54s)

[there's padding on this card that's big](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h24m56s)

[really big](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m00s)

[okay that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m01s)

[god okay so that's why it was clipping](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m06s)

[top and left because there was a padding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m09s)

[value being applied to the card which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m11s)

[was being converted to margin on the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m13s)

[content presenter which was pushing it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m15s)

[into haha](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m17s)

[mix sense](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m19s)

[um that's a horrible way of doing it uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m22s)

[let's do with a hundred maybe](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m24s)

[that'll give me a little bit to work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m28s)

[with okay so that works now](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m29s)

[but the problem still remains if you use](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m36s)

[padding to push this thing around](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m39s)

[so for example if i move this guy up so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m42s)

[if i take his](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m45s)

[uh horizontal alignment](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m46s)

[and send him left](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m49s)

[and actually let's just do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m52s)

[alignment](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m53s)

[uh vertical alignment if i push him top](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m55s)

[right when i click on him](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h25m58s)

[we're back to clipping right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m00s)

[so it's clipping top left because as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m03s)

[soon as i shove him up against that edge](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m05s)

[he's going to clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m07s)

[so we're back to the original bug](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m09s)

[and we know that moving the clip up is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m12s)

[bad because it kills the shadow](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m17s)

[the question now comes how to do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m19s)

[and i don't know how to write a test for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m21s)

[this because it's hard to write a test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m22s)

[to say is thingy visible specifically](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m25s)

[when the thingy is an adorner](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m27s)

[that's hard](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m31s)

[so we're going to skip the test](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m33s)

[and i'm wondering why we need why we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m39s)

[need the clip at all](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m41s)

[i'm almost wondering if we turn the clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m46s)

[off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m48s)

[like why i maybe that maybe i'm missing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m55s)

[something obvious](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m57s)

[let's let's restart and check this i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h26m59s)

[wondering if we need the clipping at all](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m01s)

[like why do we need to clip our content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m03s)

[to the card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m06s)

[i i don't actually know that question](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m15s)

[and i kind of wonder if](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m18s)

[because none of these things matter here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m24s)

[and if i go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m43s)

[here and go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m47s)

[vertical alignment top](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m48s)

[horizontal alignment left](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m52s)

[and if we take this padding down at one](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h27m58s)

[i'm kind of thinking](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m10s)

[that it doesn't make a lot of sense to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m12s)

[clip these](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m14s)

[i don't understand why the card would be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m18s)

[clipped](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m21s)

[why under what situations would we need](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m23s)

[to clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m26s)

[is it like for a corner radius](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m31s)

[oh is that the kicker](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m35s)

[if we have say a uniform corner radius](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m37s)

[of i don't know 10.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m48s)

[01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:57,840](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m49s)

let's relaunch i'm wondering if it's

[if it's to eliminate the issue of when](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m55s)

[we round the corners things hanging over](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h28m57s)

[those corners](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m00s)

[that could be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m01s)

[oh i keep going cards](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m11s)

[yeah i'm wondering if that's the kicker](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m26s)

[so if we do like 50](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m28s)

[effectively we're going to make a circle](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m30s)

[i'm wondering if that's the reason for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m34s)

[the clip is when the corner radius is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m35s)

[set](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m38s)

[so that we intentionally clip the stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m39s)

[off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m41s)

[i'm kind of thinking](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m44s)

[that there's no right answer](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m46s)

[yeah so that's that's the reason to clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m50s)

[so for those people who it's not](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m55s)

[apparent to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m56s)

[when you don't clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h29m58s)

[when you do that corner radius because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m00s)

[the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m02s)

[the corner radius is applied underneath](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m03s)

[the content not as a wrap or to the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m06s)

[content there is no clipping of it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m08s)

[so to be clear why that happens](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m11s)

[is because that roundedness](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m16s)

[is coming from](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m19s)

[this border here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m20s)

[and so you'll note it's also cl](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m29s)

[it's intentionally clipping expecting to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m31s)

[be clipped](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m34s)

[there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m35s)

[and the contents allowed to float](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m36s)

[and i'm wondering if that's the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m40s)

[so to get that to get that look and to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m44s)

[effectively clip it down appropriately](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m46s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m48s)

[drop shadow that's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m49s)

[that's what we had to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h30m56s)

[actually can we get away with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m03s)

[i'm i'm just wondering if i can get away](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m16s)

[with the adorner level](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m18s)

[i just don't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m21s)

[i'm wondering if i could wrap this guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m23s)

[into here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m25s)

[i'm gonna try something real quick](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m32s)

[something in the back of my mind is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m34s)

[telling me that i tried this and it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m35s)

[doesn't work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m37s)

[but i'm wondering if i can get away with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m39s)

[this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m43s)

[i'm wondering if we can get away with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m46s)

[this because then this border handles](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m48s)

[the clipping](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m50s)

[you'll know that uh that's indented](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m52s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m54s)

[that makes it hard to see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m55s)

[actually this guy's the one who's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m57s)

[indented wrong](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h31m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m00s)

[let's give that a shot](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m02s)

[something tells me this is still](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m05s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m06s)

[pretty sure](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m12s)

[yes that's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m27s)

[that doesn't actually fix](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m29s)

[the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m31s)

[i wonder what happens if i go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m34s)

[yeah because i can't clip that guy to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m42s)

[bounds](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m44s)

[that's not worth doing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m52s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m56s)

[if that is the case](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m57s)

[get rid of that extra grid](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h32m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m02s)

[what's the appropriate thing to do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m07s)

[so in this situation here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m14s)

[do i need to do anything or can i let](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m18s)

[the cards clip to bounds take over](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m20s)

[i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m24s)

[don't think i can let it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m26s)

[take over](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m30s)

[at least not completely](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m35s)

[oh i keep doing that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m40s)

[these days i'm going to get better at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m42s)

[this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m44s)

[shadows](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m45s)

[so what happens if we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m48s)

[go up to the card here and i go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m54s)

[flip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h33m57s)

[because if we clip at the card level if](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m01s)

[we click to bounce there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m03s)

[i don't know if it's obvious what's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m05s)

[happening so let's do this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m09s)

[so you can see when i do clip to bounds](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m14s)

[you end up with this ugliness here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m16s)

[right whereas we come back and turn that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m19s)

[off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m21s)

[now now that shadow's allowed to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m23s)

[propagate out and it doesn't look weird](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m25s)

[because it's no longer being clipped](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m27s)

[because remember that shadow is sitting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m30s)

[on a border that's under the content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m31s)

[and the card wraps all of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m35s)

[so you can't really do card clip to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m38s)

[bounds but i'm wondering if i do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m40s)

[something like clip content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m42s)

[and conditionally let people set it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m46s)

[or i just turn off clipping content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m52s)

[altogether i'm i'm wondering if there is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m56s)

[a point to clipping](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h34m58s)

[the content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m00s)

[because clearly that is problematic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m05s)

[because if we apply the same clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m11s)

[right so if we do the same](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m17s)

[clip property here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m19s)

[that's being applied there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m21s)

[before we launch](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m23s)

[shadows because if we apply this clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m41s)

[this is what we end up with](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m46s)

[is that better or worse](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m53s)

[like in this case it's obvious what's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m56s)

[happening](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m58s)

[what was not obvious is when the reason](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h35m59s)

[for the clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m02s)

[was due to padding so for example when](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m03s)

[this padding was say 10.](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m06s)

[now you can see that when that comes in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m12s)

[it's really big](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m15s)

[i think that's the cleanest option](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m25s)

[is i take the clip off by default](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m28s)

[but we add in a new property to the card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m31s)

[that allows clipping content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m33s)

[yeah let's do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m39s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m45s)

[uh boom property dependency property](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m48s)

[rule](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m52s)

[clip](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m54s)

[content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h36m55s)

[kind of like that owner class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m00s)

[card](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m02s)

[and we're going to default to false](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m04s)

[vocal boom](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m08s)

[really wish](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m10s)

[the template had it up there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m12s)

[and then we are going to expression body](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m15s)

[all the things](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m17s)

[so we've got that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m21s)

[and we still need to gen this clip up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h37m25s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h41m52s)

[i'm wondering if the template binding is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h41m55s)

[the problem](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h41m57s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h41m59s)

[well let's let's just confirm that this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m09s)

[is not going to do reordering this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m11s)

[should not change a darn thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m14s)

[but it would not shock me if a template](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m16s)

[binding wasn't allowed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m18s)

[because template bindings have to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m20s)

[known](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m22s)

[ahead of time](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m24s)

[yeah okay that makes me feel better](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m28s)

[so i assume this needs to just be a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m31s)

[relative binding](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m34s)

[that's not the right property game](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m51s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m53s)

[oh i just realized uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h42m58s)

[just realizing this might be a horrible](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m00s)

[name we've got clip content and content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m02s)

[that's not a great name](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m12s)

[what do you call it though](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m16s)

[uh what did i do wrong here so misty my](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m19s)

[curly braces uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m22s)

[yeah i got an extra](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m25s)

[try again](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m27s)

[should clip content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m33s)

[is cooked content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m35s)

[something](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m40s)

[so what are the typical prefixes for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m43s)

[ghouls is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m45s)

[can](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m47s)

[should to a lesser degree maybe should](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m48s)

[clip content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m50s)

[okay so no clipping occurring](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h43m57s)

[good](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m01s)

[okay now if we go here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m04s)

[and go](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m06s)

[clip content true](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m09s)

[we should now see it get clipped](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m12s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m15s)

[that's the trade-off](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m17s)

[and i don't think i can make the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m20s)

[determination what people should do i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m22s)

[could guess based upon like a few](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m24s)

[properties like corner radius margin and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m26s)

[padding but i don't want to try to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m28s)

[divine that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m30s)

[just leave people with the option to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m33s)

[toggle it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m34s)

[that seems like the best of all worlds](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m37s)

[now the only question that remains is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m41s)

[what to call this thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m42s)

[what to call this thing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m46s)

[what should this thing be called does](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m52s)

[clip content](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m54s)

[what are the built-in ones](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h44m58s)

[just clip and clip to bounds](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m02s)

[which](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m14s)

[clip to bounds is a bool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m17s)

[and clip is a geometry](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m19s)

[so maybe there's some symmetry there](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m22s)

[i just don't like that name](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m28s)

[but i can't come up with anything](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m30s)

[very open to hear it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m47s)

[okay so back here we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h45m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m15s)

[okay so i don't think there's anything](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m17s)

[really open there already we'll do that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m21s)

[pull request](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m23s)

[let's go check our other pull request](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m25s)

[dialog host boom squash mark squash](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m28s)

[merge](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m31s)

[get that in delete branch pull request](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m32s)

[come in we'll do the icon update](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m35s)

[put that in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m38s)

[there's new icons everyone loves them](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m40s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m44s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m48s)

[that fixes the known issues](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m50s)

[so i think once this guy once this guy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m53s)

[goes in i'm gonna rebrace](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m56s)

[rebase my theme branch on top of it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h49m58s)

[what's the latest error on this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m04s)

[got some test failures](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m09s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m13s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m19s)

[this is good this is good so this comes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m21s)

[down to the way i was building up those](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m23s)

[um theme brushes so now that the bugs](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m26s)

[are fixed](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m28s)

[um i can circle back to the api on the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m30s)

[theming brush and there was something](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m32s)

[that came up in the getter chat so if we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m35s)

[come in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m39s)

[so what's going to happen in the the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m41s)

[next release is in addition to this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m43s)

[themes there's going to be a theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m45s)

[hopefully not too confusing](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m47s)

[um and one of the things that i am](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m49s)

[changing is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m50s)

[these bundled themes are going to have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m52s)

[both the the code behind which is what](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m54s)

[they they were before they were just a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m56s)

[straight c sharp class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h50m58s)

[but in the xaml side they're going to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m00s)

[have this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m02s)

[which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m05s)

[now my thought being that i would love](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m06s)

[to gen this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m10s)

[and gen a lot of stuff from this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m14s)

[so i'm thinking because i've already got](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m16s)

[and that's what's failing currently is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m19s)

[one of the tests](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m21s)

[so as long as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m22s)

[there is exists a resource with the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m25s)

[right type and a key](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m27s)

[this is what the intellisense](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m29s)

[in the example designer leverages](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m31s)

[so by having this in here like this this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m34s)

[is effectively enabling intellisense](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m37s)

[because before when you would do dynamic](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m40s)

[resource you would get some of the stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m42s)

[and like you'd see the styles show up](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m44s)

[when you would do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m46s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m48s)

[static resource material design blah](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m49s)

[blah you'd see the style great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m51s)

[um and i may look at changing the style](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m53s)

[keys](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m55s)

[later](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m56s)

[right i'm trying to trying to not bloat](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m57s)

[scope](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h51m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m00s)

[but the intent is that there's going to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m01s)

[be a bunch of these new](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m03s)

[brushes labeled out here and as long as](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m05s)

[they exist here you'll get nice](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m08s)

[intellisense which is great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m10s)

[because the intellisense is not that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m12s)

[brilliant it just literally goes through](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m14s)

[your xaml tree hierarchy is looking for](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m16s)

[stuff great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m18s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m20s)

[we'll we'll play to its strengths so we](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m21s)

[set these things up but then what we do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m23s)

[is we replace them almost immediately at](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m25s)

[runtime by going through and populate](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m27s)

[them](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m30s)

[which is fine but i think i can do](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m31s)

[better with a source generator](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m34s)

[so there is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m36s)

[the the magical mapping and this is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m38s)

[what's](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m40s)

[allowing me to get away with this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m42s)

[so this is the new so you'll know](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m44s)

[there's a there's a theme class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m46s)

[that exists at the root](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m50s)

[or an i theme class that exists at the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m53s)

[root but then there's this theme class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m55s)

[that exists down nested here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h52m58s)

[and this guy here is what actually has](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m04s)

[all the interesting stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m10s)

[if you want to do your theming and code](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m11s)

[you can do theme dot button dot and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m12s)

[you know just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m15s)

[dot into all of the the various brushes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m16s)

[and i plan to eventually have](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m19s)

[more brushes available](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m22s)

[so right now this was just convert the](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m24s)

[old stuff into the new stuff and then](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m26s)

[because i know there's a swath of issues](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m29s)

[out there all about people wanting to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m31s)

[change you know this color on this](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m33s)

[control for this condition](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m35s)

[great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m37s)

[right now the answer in unfortunately a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m38s)

[lot of cases is](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m40s)

[you don't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m41s)

[the that brush is shared in like three](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m43s)

[places so if you change it you can't](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m44s)

[change just that one you're gonna change](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m47s)

[all of them](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m48s)

[so the goal is to break some of that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m51s)

[that monolith up so that people can](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m53s)

[configure this and tweak it as they see](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m55s)

[fit the the default stuff will still](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m56s)

[populate everything the way](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h53m59s)

[one would hope um](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m01s)

[but](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m03s)

[if we look at like this guy here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m05s)

[this theme manager class you'll know it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m09s)

[takes in an old theme and this is an](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m11s)

[obsolete method](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m14s)

[but it takes in the old class and maps](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m15s)

[it to the new class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m17s)

[so all of the old stuff is expected to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m19s)

[work so for the 430 and maybe 4-4-0](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m21s)

[release](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m24s)

[old names new names should both work](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m25s)

[however old names you will probably](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m28s)

[start to see warnings flagging you and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m31s)

[my hope is to write a small script](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m33s)

[probably powershell core](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m35s)

[that you can point at a repo and say](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m37s)

[update my brushes](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m39s)

[it may not be perfect it's likely going](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m41s)

[to do a lot of regex](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m43s)

[but it'll hopefully be a good like 95](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m46s)

[solution to make the upgrade path easy](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m50s)

[that's the hope](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m52s)

[if anybody wants to help with that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m54s)

[that'd be great](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m55s)

[um but right now the the next the next](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h54m57s)

[battleground is going to be](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m00s)

[getting all of these brushes updated and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m02s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m04s)

[i can use these xaml dictionaries as a](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m07s)

[as a source to generate this stuff](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m12s)

[i might need to go the other direction](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m16s)

[might need to go the other direction](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m19s)

[the so the only reason i'm hesitating](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m24s)

[is because i know something about how](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m27s)

[the wpf compile works](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m28s)

[and the unfortunate part about the wpf](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m30s)

[compile is they're sort of a two-step](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m32s)

[process](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m34s)

[if you step through the various steps in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m35s)

[ms build you'll see that there's a like](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m37s)

[a design time xaml](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m39s)

[compilation that occurs](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m41s)

[and](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m43s)

[if i tried to have a source gender](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m44s)

[generate the xaml for me](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m46s)

[like what's inside of here](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m48s)

[which would be ideal because i'd like to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m51s)

[have everything declared in the theme](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m53s)

[class](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m55s)

[let this thing be the source of truth](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m56s)

[and have it drive](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h55m58s)

[the other things](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m00s)

[i don't think i can get away with that](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m01s)

[simply because](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m05s)

[of how that compilation works but i](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m08s)

[might try it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m10s)

[the other thing is as long as i've got](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m11s)

[unit tests validating it](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m14s)

[it might not be that bad to keep them in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m17s)

[sync by hand](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m18s)

[because they won't be able to get out of](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m21s)

[sync because as soon as you open a pr](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m23s)

[it's going to get rejected](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m24s)

[because the test will fail](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m26s)

[so maybe that's okay maybe that's good](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m29s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m31s)

[maybe that's good enough](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m35s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m38s)

[but i think what i'm gonna do is i'm](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m41s)

[gonna get the last of these](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m42s)

[things on the theme brushes uh](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m44s)

[rebased here as soon as this merges](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m47s)

[and then i think aside from just](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m50s)

[updating a bunch of those resources](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m52s)

[i think i think it might be close to](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m55s)

[merging and being](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m57s)

[in](https://youtu.be/q7r-O6mB-Gs?t=01h56m59s)
