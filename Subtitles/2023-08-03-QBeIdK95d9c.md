[week's stream we worked on a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m14s)

[program called rentopoly which was a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m16s)

[simple application I love board games I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m18s)

[love programming and so naturally I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m20s)

[write software for board gaming because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m22s)

[that was fun for me uh more importantly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m23s)

[board games are meant to be played and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m26s)

[very simple kind of checkout style](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m38s)

[application for me to keep track of just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m39s)

[who have I learned what to that was the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m41s)

[idea with um sort of a side goal of it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m44s)

[being a more of a full-fledged simpler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m47s)

[kind of thing can you point me to any](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m57s)

[reasonable examples it's kind of hoping](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h00m58s)

[for this to be a bit of an example so so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m00s)

[writing some stuff just for the kicks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m02s)

[and Giggles of having good example code](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m05s)

[in there apparently my stream was so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m07s)

[the recovering python tag though I'm not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m48s)

[sure I'll use that at the python group](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m51s)

[yeah that's probably not gonna be great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h01m54s)

[those too don't you yes yeah we try and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m05s)

[live stream all of them last week or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m07s)

[last month we didn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m09s)

[um but that's just because it was like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m11s)

[sort of a different format but usually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m13s)

[when it's just a normal presentation](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m15s)

[we'll live stream it cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m16s)

[so and I know they've done a lot of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m18s)

[um I they've got the previous meetups if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m23s)

[people are interested in kind of what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m25s)

[type of stuff they do these can kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m26s)

[range quite a bit python developers like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m28s)

[to dabble in lots of different areas at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m30s)

[least that's my intended](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m32s)

[like they just import a package and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m33s)

[proof okay today we're doing AI or poof](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m35s)

[but now we're doing computer vision or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m37s)

[it's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m39s)

[let's let's you know bring something in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m40s)

[and build a website or whatever so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m42s)

[it's really like the python Linux](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m45s)

[embedded AI User Group awesome](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m47s)

[Etc](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m52s)

[oh wait no justice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h02m59s)

[he is a we'll call it a regular so uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m00s)

[last time on rentopoly I hadn't updated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m05s)

[my readme and a very kind YouTube viewer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m08s)

[pointed out that I didn't bother to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m11s)

[write a description anywhere so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m13s)

[figured let's write a description so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m15s)

[tonight's stream is going to end up on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m17s)

[the read me under part two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m19s)

[because last time we got most of the way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m21s)

[through a lot of stuff but we didn't get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m23s)

[all the way there we got a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m25s)

[distracted I may have gotten hung up on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m26s)

[making an arrow go round and round and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m29s)

[spin on refresh because that was cool so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m31s)

[let's fire this thing up and then we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m34s)

[decide where we want to go first](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m36s)

[so you get to as the guest of honor you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m38s)

[get to decide what you think would be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m40s)

[interesting to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m42s)

[so lovely so we built this thing out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m44s)

[we've we've artificially slowed down the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m47s)

[load just for the purpose of so we could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m49s)

[see the loading spinner go and I don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m51s)

[know if you caught it in in this little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m53s)

[corner](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m56s)

[we made the little icon spin it's so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m57s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h03m59s)

[I ran it locally and I was like wait](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m00s)

[it's using SQL Lite why is it loading](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m02s)

[like why is anything need to load it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m05s)

[because so because unfortunately when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m07s)

[you're trying to do a oh hang on we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m11s)

[didn't delete that one let's see gear](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m13s)

[rentals uh it's this task delay right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m18s)

[it turns out that SQL light was a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m20s)

[too fast and we were loading all the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m22s)

[data more or less instantaneously and um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m24s)

[well you don't get to see your loading](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m28s)

[spinner if you do that so we have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m29s)

[artificially decided that we're going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m31s)

[slow it down for kicks and Giggles or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m33s)

[we're going to make our database so big](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m35s)

[that it actually takes two seconds](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m37s)

[one of the two I don't know which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m39s)

[so but we got the simple app we can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m42s)

[create a new rental like I can say I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m45s)

[going to uh loan](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m47s)

[to Joe save we can go back over to My](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m50s)

[Views and I can see that I loaned](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m53s)

[something out to you and on the date and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h04m57s)

[then I can mark it if it's returned or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m01s)

[not you'll note here so a lot lots of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m03s)

[things we haven't implemented yet one we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m05s)

[have not implemented the game catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m07s)

[which you know that might be a useful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m09s)

[thing to have at some point uh we have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m11s)

[not implemented actually showing the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m14s)

[list of games here because frankly we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m16s)

[don't have the game catalog implemented](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m17s)

[so there was nothing to to link to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m19s)

[um and unlike the new rental once again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m22s)

[we probably need to pull that in there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m24s)

[other kind of UI things like we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m26s)

[lacking a cool icon up here which could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m28s)

[be I mean that's all of two minutes to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m31s)

[go and add but that could be fun and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m33s)

[then I think we we started down the idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m35s)

[of building out some tests but we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m38s)

[haven't done a ton of it and by having](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m40s)

[done a ton of it I mean we've done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m42s)

[exactly one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m43s)

[which is not health coverage right there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m48s)

[which is which is not a lot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m50s)

[but at least it's the loner yeah but it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m54s)

[does go through and call out kind of how](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h05m57s)

[how this is expected to be set up so we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m01s)

[can we can start adding more stuff to it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m03s)

[um I'm kind of thinking real quick this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m07s)

[main window view model we kind of killed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m10s)

[off its intent yeah so we're just going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m11s)

[to Burn It To The Ground that's just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m13s)

[it's no longer useful we don't need it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m14s)

[die](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m17s)

[okay so what do you think would be fun](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m18s)

[to do what should we do first](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m20s)

[being able to add a game would be really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m23s)

[useful because that's the first thing I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m25s)

[tried to do when I ran it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m26s)

[how dare you how dare you use the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m28s)

[opening screen](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m30s)

[also a side side note have you seen Josh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m32s)

[Ward's game website yes I have and I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m35s)

[jealous of it at some point I have high](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m39s)

[hopes of doing like Blazer hybrid inside](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m42s)

[of here to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m44s)

[like have web front have the web front](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m46s)

[end for like viewing and then this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m50s)

[like the back end we'll call that we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m51s)

[call that V5](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m54s)

[but yes I I have high hopes of getting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h06m56s)

[there at some point because we may](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m00s)

[eventually migrate off of SQL Lite into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m01s)

[like real Sequel and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m03s)

[and throw something in Azure and all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m07s)

[that kind of fun jazz](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m09s)

[it's equal it's real it's super real](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m10s)

[what's uh it's real as long as you like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m13s)

[local what's have you seen fly.io they](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m16s)

[have like uh they acquired a tool that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m20s)

[to like back up your SQL light I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m22s)

[give you versioning fly dot IO fly.io](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m25s)

[it's uh what everyone went to when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m29s)

[Heroku got rid of its free tier ah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m31s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m34s)

[yeah there's I don't think if you look](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m37s)

[at their doc their articles they don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m39s)

[have anything on C sharp I think they](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m40s)

[just assume that everyone's probably](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m42s)

[using Azure for that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m43s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m46s)

[note yourself putting this on my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m48s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m52s)

[um yeah I think adding the game would be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m53s)

[sweet maybe a cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m55s)

[uh dashboard of the games you have okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h07m56s)

[well that might be a long list and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m00s)

[might and I'm probably not going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m03s)

[remember them all from memory I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m03s)

[have to walk downstairs and actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m05s)

[figure out what they are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m06s)

[um Okay so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m08s)

[do you want to start from the top where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m09s)

[we do like the UI first and work down to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m12s)

[it do you want to start from the bottom](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m14s)

[with like a view model and work up or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m17s)

[like test driven design and start with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m20s)

[the test and go backwards](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m21s)

[let's start](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m23s)

[let's start from the bottom so view](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m26s)

[model yeah so okay so I'm gonna propose](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m28s)

[then that we need a new namespace maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m31s)

[something called games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m33s)

[right and uh let's call this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m36s)

[I don't know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m40s)

[catalog view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m46s)

[so is this typically how you and I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m48s)

[you mentioned this in your live stream](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m51s)

[you sort of categorize your vertical](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m52s)

[business logic slices into these folders](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h08m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m00s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m01s)

[wow okay how do you spell catalog let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m04s)

[start with that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m08s)

[okay I realize K log is probably wrong](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m09s)

[good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m15s)

[hang on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m18s)

[I thought it was too old](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m20s)

[pilot how do you spell](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m24s)

[catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m27s)

[I have found](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m31s)

[AI is worthless the correct spelling of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m35s)

[catalog is with a C](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m37s)

[it's great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m41s)

[Copilot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m42s)

[I yeah let's just say copilot's not not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m46s)

[the most useful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m50s)

[oh it's close I just needed to not be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m52s)

[cake catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m55s)

[so that's I haven't seen that chat](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m57s)

[before that's neat I've only seen like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h09m59s)

[the auto suggestions oh catalog oh hang](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m01s)

[on I see a GUI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m04s)

[oh hang on is this gonna be one of those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m08s)

[oh now I now I have to look up the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m16s)

[grammatical difference between](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m18s)

[g-u-e](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m20s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m24s)

[are we gonna go with American English](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m25s)

[or everywhere else](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m29s)

[I'd say America](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m32s)

[okay uh so yes this is GitHub chat it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m37s)

[was I don't know if it's out of private](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m40s)

[beta yet](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m42s)

[I have had we will say low expectations](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m44s)

[for it it has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m47s)

[the few times I've used it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m49s)

[um it has been that that level of it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m52s)

[starts with a C that's the level of help](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m54s)

[I've received from it and I I didn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h10m57s)

[know it's been actively harmful over](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m00s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m02s)

[um no but to answer your question yeah I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m03s)

[do tend to like and I've gone I've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m05s)

[waffled on this over the years so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m07s)

[depending if you look at like code I've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m09s)

[written in the past you will see that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m11s)

[I'm very like it's not been consistent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m13s)

[however current mentality Kevin thinks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m16s)

[that separating things by logical](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m19s)

[function generally seems to produce](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m22s)

[better results](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m25s)

[makes sense that that's been and again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m28s)

[people will have different different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m30s)

[opinions](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m32s)

[um okay but we are going to be Source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m34s)

[generating all the things partial class](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m36s)

[observable object uh observe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m40s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m47s)

[this is this I'm really glad I'm not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m50s)

[paid for my typing or spelling ability](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m52s)

[because oh boy I'd be out of a job](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m57s)

[I saw you had a previous talk on this I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h11m58s)

[think it was on that toolkit or the mdv](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m01s)

[VM yeah he's running your more recent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m03s)

[ones I have not watched the talk but I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m05s)

[saw it was there this I think you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m06s)

[referenced it yeah the the one that I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m08s)

[did on the 8.0 release of the community](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m11s)

[toolkit is by far](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m13s)

[it may be my top performing video at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m16s)

[this point](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m18s)

[um it kind of caught on by a wildfire](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m20s)

[and people shared it in a couple of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m22s)

[popular forums and so it picked up a lot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m23s)

[of views](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m25s)

[um but it is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m27s)

[for anybody doing mvdm which you I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m29s)

[you've got some experience with like MVC](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m33s)

[style Frameworks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m34s)

[a little bit yeah I did so the one C](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m36s)

[sharp project I did before I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m40s)

[started doing python in the corner](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m44s)

[um was uh like dotnet asp.net core 3.1 I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m46s)

[think with an angular front end got it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m53s)

[and then that's the only professional](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m55s)

[project I worked on other than like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m57s)

[Stefan classes yeah so mvvm and MVC are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h12m58s)

[fairly similar the different the big](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m02s)

[difference between them is in a model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m04s)

[view controller idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m08s)

[um The View may actually like know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m10s)

[something and do that communication](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m13s)

[whereas in an mvvm the The View model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m15s)

[should really be all right I guess I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m18s)

[said that backwards the controller knows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m20s)

[something about the view and is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m22s)

[oftentimes you know pushing things or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m24s)

[controlling things or switching things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m26s)

[up on it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m27s)

[um whereas in an mvvm style uh the view](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m28s)

[model should be pretty agnostic about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m32s)

[the view and not know anything about it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m34s)

[the view model exposes the data and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m36s)

[relies on the presence of some sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m38s)

[like binding engine for that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m40s)

[communication to go back and forth the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m42s)

[view knows about the view model but not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m43s)

[the other way around and it lets you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m45s)

[then kind of re-template things in a lot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m47s)

[of different ways where you may swap out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m49s)

[that view to do or look differently in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m51s)

[different areas](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m54s)

[which is both a benefit and where some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m55s)

[the the criticism comes of people going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h13m59s)

[that's too complicated we never do that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m01s)

[yada yada it's like no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m03s)

[but in in WPF land we were given a first](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m05s)

[class awesome binding engine and so we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m09s)

[abuse it okay okay so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m11s)

[um I think one of the things we're going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m16s)

[to need is we're going to need a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m17s)

[collection of games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m18s)

[right I think is what we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m20s)

[right so we'll say game view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m22s)

[for our okay for our catalog for our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m25s)

[catalog because I I think we're gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m27s)

[want we're going to want to see the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m29s)

[result of it so let's do public](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m30s)

[uh partial class game view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m33s)

[now are these all are these partial](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m38s)

[because of what you are inheriting from](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m40s)

[no so they're partial for the source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m43s)

[generators so the the nvvm toolkit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m46s)

[leverages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m49s)

[the later c-sharp Source generators to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m51s)

[be able to generate out multiple things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m54s)

[so for example normally you end up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m55s)

[having to build out like a like uh I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h14m57s)

[trying to think of a good example I'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m01s)

[just pick on this one down here all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m02s)

[right so if I convert this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m04s)

[convert to full property so if you were](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m05s)

[to do a full](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m07s)

[property thing in here in order](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m09s)

[um for the view to know that a property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m12s)

[is changed this Base Class implements an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m15s)

[interface called I notify property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m18s)

[change so people often get really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m21s)

[confused as to how the whole binding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m23s)

[engine works it's not magical at all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m25s)

[this event gets raised when Visual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m27s)

[Studio is done crashing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m30s)

[um the event arcs has a a property name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m32s)

[and The Binding engine is just looking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m37s)

[for that property name oh yeah Visual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m39s)

[Studio crashed all the way down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m41s)

[excellent uh yeah let's go and recover](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m42s)

[that please](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m46s)

[uh okay that makes sense I think you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m47s)

[talked about that a little bit in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m49s)

[first part of your last talk right yep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m51s)

[and the the big limitation is we don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m53s)

[like writing all of that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m56s)

[code so we just don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h15m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m03s)

[and gotcha and so that's what the source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m04s)

[generators end up generating for us](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m07s)

[behind the scenes is all of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m09s)

[boilerplate needed for that so we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m10s)

[we'll pull that in here in a moment](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m15s)

[name description I don't like the min](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m16s)

[max players](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m18s)

[uh I'm probably gonna use it though so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m20s)

[might do it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m24s)

[oh live share is actually what crashed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m27s)

[it that's exciting I can I can kick that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m29s)

[thing back up again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m33s)

[all right if it crashes it again it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m35s)

[it's okay I can just I can watch well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m38s)

[yes but it would be cooler to have it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m40s)

[not suck](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m42s)

[okay so link to you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m45s)

[and there it goes I do like how it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m48s)

[doesn't like just blindly expose the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m51s)

[link to everybody on screen which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m52s)

[great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m54s)

[as exciting as it would be to all of a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m57s)

[sudden have a bunch of visitors coming](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h16m59s)

[in and editing the code that would be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m00s)

[less than thrilling okay and then we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m02s)

[need to decide really quick on the idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m05s)

[of how do we want the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m07s)

[how do we want to actually do the ad so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m10s)

[couple choices we could do kind of a a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m14s)

[dialogue pop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m17s)

[what is your problem](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m19s)

[non-nullable](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m20s)

[oh yeah we don't need that anymore](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m23s)

[like yeah I know there's no ability](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m25s)

[warnings ignore them we are using that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m27s)

[glass yet](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m31s)

[we could either do like a dialogue pop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m33s)

[and like you know maybe have an ad](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m35s)

[button that pops a dialogue here that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m37s)

[you fill out or we could do something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m39s)

[kind of in line where you just bring](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m41s)

[them in thoughts preferences](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m43s)

[I kind of hate dialogues or like modals](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m47s)

[at least in like web stuff I find that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m50s)

[you'll you'll have like the full screen](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m52s)

[modal with eight like 20 different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m54s)

[fields and then you accidentally click](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m56s)

[off and it you lose everything](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h17m58s)

[the the more web stuff I do the the less](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m01s)

[modals I reach for so this isn't web but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m04s)

[I let's just go inline inline okay so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m08s)

[we're gonna have this view model then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m11s)

[kind of drive all of the the stuff right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m13s)

[so let's have a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m17s)

[uh public game view model we'll call it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m21s)

[new game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m24s)

[and actually we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m26s)

[and we'll make you notable and we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m29s)

[to bind to you so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m32s)

[observable property proof Source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m34s)

[generator all the things I win okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m36s)

[and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m39s)

[let's go down here and go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m41s)

[do that maneuver](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m44s)

[do that maneuver no that's not how you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m46s)

[spell new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m49s)

[okay you'd be fine and then we're gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m52s)

[do The Binding operations uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m54s)

[uh Naval collection synchronization](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h18m58s)

[games so I had mentioned this on my last](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m00s)

[stream is that this is how this is how](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m03s)

[we tell](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m07s)

[the WPF binding engine that we're gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m08s)

[update this from multiple threads](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m11s)

[and to please lock this is technically](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m13s)

[new object it's just not obvious](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m16s)

[um but to lock on this object instance](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m19s)

[before doing any mutations to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m21s)

[collection that way we don't have a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m24s)

[cross threading problem](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m26s)

[so this will just say here's an object](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m27s)

[to lock on please do the needed locking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m30s)

[make it all work the really unfortunate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m32s)

[thing you must call this from the UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m34s)

[thread or it will fail silently which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m37s)

[just except and fail silently is the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m40s)

[wrong words but it won't work the way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m43s)

[you want and your world will end and no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m45s)

[one will be happy and they'll be crying](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m47s)

[and that kind of thing so we won't do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m49s)

[that so this this lock object is just an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m51s)

[arbitrary object it's really just an a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m54s)

[single instance of what you of to pass](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h19m58s)

[it and I generally will just new up a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m00s)

[new object and feed something in I'm a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m03s)

[little disappointed that there isn't an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m06s)

[overload that just doesn't take an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m08s)

[object and just news one up for you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m10s)

[that would have made me much happier](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m13s)

[but that's apparently not a thing so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m16s)

[I've seen projects where people have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m21s)

[written various extensions to be able to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m22s)

[go through and do it okay and then we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m24s)

[register up our our di thing so that our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m26s)

[di container knows that hey we want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m30s)

[do this catalog V model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m32s)

[and then the last thing we're going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m34s)

[do is we are going to plug that thing in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m35s)

[on our UI itself](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m38s)

[so we've got all of these tabs](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m40s)

[and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m44s)

[all of these tabs that we've put in here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m45s)

[already](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m47s)

[have these views slapped into them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m48s)

[where we've kind of built out like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m53s)

[ad rental view user control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m54s)

[so I think we'll just go through and do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m57s)

[the same thing uh in games we'll do like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h20m58s)

[a catalog View](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m01s)

[and keep it simple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m03s)

[do you typically are you writing your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m05s)

[your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m08s)

[xaml from scratch or are you using like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m09s)

[a UI Builder tool that is a wonderful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m12s)

[question so visual studio has a UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m16s)

[designer it's a nice wysiwyg designer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m18s)

[that you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m21s)

[well I've even I don't even know where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m22s)

[there's the toolbox I don't as you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m25s)

[tell I use the toolbox very often like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m28s)

[never](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m31s)

[um and I don't know why it's thinking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m32s)

[it's initializing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m34s)

[because you've never never opened it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m36s)

[yeah so there are people who enjoy being](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m38s)

[able to come in here and grab a button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m41s)

[and say okay I'm going to drag a button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m42s)

[into here great I'm going to put the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m44s)

[button here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m45s)

[um I'm gonna pull in the various you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m48s)

[see I use the material design Library](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m50s)

[um because it is awesome and wonderful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m53s)

[and you can see the various things that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m55s)

[it affords you and then the common WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h21m57s)

[controls the problem I have is that most](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m00s)

[of the time it's quicker for me to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m03s)

[edit by hand than to use this designer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m05s)

[the other drawback is when you position](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m09s)

[things it positions them by hard coding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m11s)

[your horizontal and vertical alignment](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m15s)

[and then setting an absolute position](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m16s)

[with margin which is potentially the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m18s)

[worst possible way to position a control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m21s)

[you can come up with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m23s)

[and I hate it so very much so I don't do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m25s)

[that hardly at all uh gotcha okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m30s)

[but in here we are going to need to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m35s)

[something right so let's do something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m37s)

[along the lines of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m41s)

[trying to think of how we want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m44s)

[display our games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m45s)

[uh I'm thinking we have our entry field](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m47s)

[at the top and the list of games below](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m50s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m52s)

[or do we want the games up top and maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m54s)

[an ad field that that expands up when we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m56s)

[want to add something we could do a flat](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h22m59s)

[on the side that could be fun oh like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m01s)

[file from the right yeah I like that you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m04s)

[like that idea okay so let's do that so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m07s)

[uh we call that a not a dock panel a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m10s)

[drawer post](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m14s)

[which not a hamburger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m17s)

[well sort of we can depends on how we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m19s)

[want to open it like we've got so the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m22s)

[drawer host is something from the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m24s)

[material design project but it gives you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m26s)

[that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m28s)

[fly Audi effect from any side that you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m29s)

[want so we'll do the inside content](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m31s)

[around it first I usually like my grids](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m34s)

[and then inside the grid let's do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m37s)

[actually do we want a group no let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m41s)

[just do a scroll viewer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m43s)

[is grid comparable to like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m46s)

[CSS grids](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m49s)

[Yes except for they don't suck](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m51s)

[um okay sorry was that my out loud voice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m55s)

[also do you let me ask you this do you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m57s)

[prefer writing uis an example or in like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h23m59s)

[HTML and CSS](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m05s)

[my preference is xaml but that's more of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m06s)

[a biased of experience rather than a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m08s)

[saying that it's better like CSS and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m10s)

[styling in HTML is incred is a lot more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m14s)

[powerful like there's a lot you can do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m17s)

[xaml is incredibly verbose](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m19s)

[um and I usually tell people there's a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m22s)

[steep learning curve and it's worth it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m24s)

[gotcha okay one of our one of our newest](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m26s)

[colleagues who just came onto a WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m29s)

[project with me he just told me a couple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m32s)

[days ago he's like you were right it is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m34s)

[a really steep learning curse](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m36s)

[it's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m37s)

[I rest my case but yeah so I prefer it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m40s)

[but that's more of a thing of I'm very](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m44s)

[familiar with it and so I'm fairly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m47s)

[confident in what I'm going to do with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m49s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m51s)

[um so we're going to do an items control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m52s)

[um and then you know we'll come back and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h24m57s)

[we'll come back and add a soon let's do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m00s)

[it so it's everything that's not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m02s)

[prefixed with material design just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m03s)

[kicked in or part of the like standard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m06s)

[library of controls yes and actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m10s)

[this is one of the nice things okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m12s)

[we're gonna run into a box that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m14s)

[annoying this is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m15s)

[I actually like about xaml it's so even](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m17s)

[though it's verbose once you understand](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m19s)

[the syntax it's incredibly easy to read](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m21s)

[in my opinion so let so C sharp has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m23s)

[using statements at the top to tell you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m26s)

[kind of what name spaces and things that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m28s)

[you're bringing into reference xaml has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m30s)

[the same thing but they're these XML](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m32s)

[namespaces and with XML every type is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m34s)

[always namespace colon type name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m39s)

[and so every namespace or using](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m42s)

[statement that you bring in you have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m45s)

[give a name to it except for whatever](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m46s)

[one you bring in without a prefix so all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m49s)

[of like the scroll viewer items control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m53s)

[these ones these ones happen to live](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m55s)

[inside of this namespace](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m57s)

[so that's the that's the magical](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h25m59s)

[incantation so it's yes it's baked in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m01s)

[but the only reason these things are in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m04s)

[the default namespace is because the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m06s)

[default file template defaults it that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m08s)

[way if we were doing something that was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m10s)

[purely material design there's nothing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m12s)

[actually stopping us from making this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m14s)

[the default namespace and then you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m16s)

[see then this freaks out and goes uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m18s)

[so what's the is the X colon class](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m21s)

[is that for styling stuff line two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m25s)

[uh or is that just sort of a unique](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m29s)

[identifier ah so this is actually down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m31s)

[so let's do let's order it like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m34s)

[so this is actually coming from this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m38s)

[name space here so once again a common](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m39s)

[built-in namespace the x namespace is a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m42s)

[lot of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m46s)

[it's almost like built-in stuff that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m48s)

[kind of extensiony a little bit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m50s)

[um so for example the most common one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m52s)

[that you'll see down on these guys is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m54s)

[like X colon name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h26m57s)

[um and what this actually ends up doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m00s)

[is in your code behind file if you give](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m02s)

[something a name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m04s)

[then here I can do this dot boo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m06s)

[and it now shows up whereas the rest of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m10s)

[my elements are are pretty much just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m12s)

[unnamed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m14s)

[um and all that X colon is doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m16s)

[this x colon class is saying hey the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m18s)

[code behind file for this bit of xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m21s)

[lives here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m23s)

[that's it okay it's no more magical than](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m25s)

[that it's it's literally just Mappy to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m27s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m29s)

[um you can do there's a thing called a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m30s)

[resource dictionary and oftentimes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m32s)

[people don't realize resource](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m33s)

[dictionaries can have code behinds as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m35s)

[well if you specify an X class on it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m37s)

[do you need that almost never but can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m41s)

[you do it yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m43s)

[that's okay well to round out I think I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m45s)

[understand the height and width what's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m49s)

[that MC ignorable](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m51s)

[uh so this one down here is saying for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m56s)

[um designer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m58s)

[ignore the following namespace stuff so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h27m59s)

[D is always pointed at this expression](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m02s)

[blend which is an old product](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m05s)

[technically still around where Microsoft](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m06s)

[that had this Grandeur idea that UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m09s)

[developers would edit all of the xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m11s)

[and this thing called expression blend](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m13s)

[and then developers would write the code](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m15s)

[and then everybody could work in harmony](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m16s)

[that hasn't really panned out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m19s)

[the so you have to still include it or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m21s)

[is it is that like the default uh it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m24s)

[the default you don't have to include it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m26s)

[but the one thing that we want it for is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m28s)

[this so the because expression blend is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m29s)

[so tightly built in it allows you to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m33s)

[designer time thingies so for example](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m35s)

[you'll note that this control currently](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m38s)

[is showing up as 450 high at 800 wide](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m39s)

[and it's only doing that because of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m43s)

[these design ones](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m46s)

[um the other thing we can do is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m47s)

[something like say say we have a button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m49s)

[right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m51s)

[and we do content Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m53s)

[right so I now have a button I'm just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m55s)

[going to make this go away](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h28m58s)

[that has a content of Joe but if I do D](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m00s)

[colon Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m04s)

[it looks the same here but at runtime](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m05s)

[the content won't be set](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m08s)

[so you can use it to set up design time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m10s)

[only data and you can apply it to any](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m13s)

[property you want you can say okay in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m15s)

[design time I want you know D](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m17s)

[um vertical alignment top now should you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m21s)

[do this no it's going to confuse The](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m24s)

[Living Daylights out of you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m26s)

[um can you do it yes it's really common](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m28s)

[for setting up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m30s)

[um like text boxes and that sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m32s)

[thing so that you can kind of pre-can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m34s)

[some data and get a feel of okay here's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m36s)

[the wrapping does that look right and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m39s)

[that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m41s)

[and sometimes it's useful to be able to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m42s)

[say you know especially if you have a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m44s)

[dynamically sized thing to just like say](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m46s)

[okay for the designer purposes show me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m47s)

[what this looks like at 40 High](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m49s)

[sorry so those that design height and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m53s)

[width that isn't actually controlling it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m56s)

[at runtime correct it's designer only](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h29m59s)

[the other big thing that we get inside](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m01s)

[of here is we want a catalog view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m04s)

[so we can also set this data context](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m07s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m10s)

[um and the key thing with the data](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m12s)

[context is this drives the source for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m14s)

[our bindings so I'm gonna get rid of our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m16s)

[food here real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m18s)

[so for example when I say my item Source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m19s)

[when I go binding space I now actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m21s)

[have visibility into the properties on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m24s)

[my view model so I can go oh okay I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m27s)

[to bind to my games property so by](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m30s)

[telling it what the view model will be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m33s)

[at runtime I now get nice intellisense](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m34s)

[inside my xaml so even if you don't use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m37s)

[the designer I oftentimes will at bare](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m39s)

[minimum be setting this much on it just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m42s)

[for the intellisense otherwise the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m45s)

[intellisense has nothing to work with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m47s)

[and it's just confusing and no one likes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m48s)

[that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m51s)

[okay that makes sense uh okay so we did](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m53s)

[that we did that we did that let's make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m56s)

[sure we plug in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h30m58s)

[this guy uh your data context no longer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m00s)

[exists so go away](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m03s)

[um okay so this is our nope this is our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m05s)

[second tab](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m08s)

[the space there white space is important](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m09s)

[and then this has a text block so you'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m12s)

[know this has a text box of D text to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m14s)

[but yeah when we launched the app there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m17s)

[was no text there so that no worked uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m19s)

[so let's do games uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m23s)

[game catalog view oh you are not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m26s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m31s)

[I'm sure yeah I know it's an error in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m33s)

[the style stop freaking out and do what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m35s)

[I tell you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m37s)

[no no I understand I understand invalid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m41s)

[xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m44s)

[eval demo there we go yeah does it auto](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m46s)

[format for you so sorry Imports and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m50s)

[stuff um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m53s)

[on mine yes normal people know so I am](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m55s)

[running an extension called](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h31m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m01s)

[uh xaml Styler that's what it is and it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m03s)

[goes through and does it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m07s)

[uh that just is like on save or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m10s)

[something yeah I have it set up somewhat](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m12s)

[aggressively but yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m15s)

[uh extensions manage extensions](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m17s)

[the the other nice thing about xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m20s)

[Styler is you can actually check in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m23s)

[config file similar to your editor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m25s)

[config into a repo and then everybody](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m27s)

[who has the extension picks up the same](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m29s)

[settings that's the preferred way to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m31s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m33s)

[um aggressive code formatters prevent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m35s)

[like stem style Awards yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m37s)

[Minnie 4G welcome we're continuing on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m41s)

[from last week](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m43s)

[uh okay so I want to figure out why we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m45s)

[aren't compiling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m48s)

[main window view model doesn't exist so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m50s)

[it turns out if you have tests that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m52s)

[Target main window view model and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m54s)

[you delete it the tests are meaningless](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m56s)

[so let's try this again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h32m58s)

[uh let's see catalog game view does not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m00s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m03s)

[oh that's because it's not catalog game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m05s)

[view catalog View](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m06s)

[all my Mountain Dew out that would be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m47s)

[bad yeah not work not worth it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m48s)

[syntax the highlighting colors I chose](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m54s)

[and the visual studio icon that I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h33m56s)

[to working and launching we aren't doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m07s)

[anything useful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m09s)

[um and then one other thing so I'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m11s)

[point this out to you there is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m13s)

[there is a wonderful app for WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m15s)

[developers called Snoop Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m18s)

[does have some built-in support they](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m20s)

[call it their live uh their live visual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m22s)

[tree](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m25s)

[but for example I can now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m27s)

[control click in and I can see that I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m30s)

[all the way inside of my game catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m32s)

[view I don't know if you can catch this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m34s)

[it's kind of hard to see uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m36s)

[there is a there's an itty bitty little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m40s)

[red borderline around the outside edge](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m44s)

[see my views loaded up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m50s)

[I can look at my data context and my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m52s)

[data context is not set so I know I'm an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m54s)

[idiot and didn't set it so we're going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m55s)

[to go back and fix it so it's like Dev](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m57s)

[tools for WPF correct](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h34m59s)

[um the visual studio ones exist](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m06s)

[say snooper](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m08s)

[yeah and if you search for it you want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m10s)

[to do Snoop WPF because if you just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m13s)

[search Snoop you end up with things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m15s)

[Snoopy and Snoop Dogg neither of which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m17s)

[will help you with your WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m19s)

[in case you were considering music I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m24s)

[mean I guess you could try](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m26s)

[you never know Peter boys he is the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m28s)

[creator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m31s)

[Peter boys what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m32s)

[Bastion Smith](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m35s)

[is the current maintainer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m38s)

[ah okay Carry Fourth then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m40s)

[uh okay so data context di all the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m45s)

[things we're good okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m48s)

[okay so we got this thing built up we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m50s)

[are going to do some sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m53s)

[pop in and out thingymabobber what do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m56s)

[you want the the trigger to be to open](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h35m59s)

[up the fly out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m01s)

[should we slap a button on or what are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m03s)

[we doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m05s)

[uh wait can you can you run the app yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m06s)

[it's going to be very boring though](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m10s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m14s)

[I go here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m16s)

[I got nothing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m17s)

[right like a yeah like a little button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m19s)

[in the top right little button in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m22s)

[top right arrow pointing left just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m24s)

[begging to be opened begging to be open](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m26s)

[Okay so let's do something like a grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m28s)

[and we're gonna do a grid with a couple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m33s)

[rows and you'll note I haven't stopped](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m36s)

[my debugger yet because I'm going fast](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m38s)

[and loose](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m41s)

[reloading yes you do well let me phrase](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m42s)

[you get it when it works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m47s)

[um and when your formatter actually has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m51s)

[it and so this scroll viewer is going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m55s)

[go in Grid Row one and then we're gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h36m58s)

[do a button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m03s)

[uh let's see the content we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m04s)

[a a pack icon kind I don't know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m07s)

[Arrow left](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m10s)

[that sounds great to me so you define](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m12s)

[your Grid at the top but you're not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m16s)

[actually nesting stuff within your your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m18s)

[rows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m21s)

[by like nesting the XML that I could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m22s)

[xaml elements correct so in this case uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m26s)

[and I don't technically need to do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m29s)

[because the the default value of an into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m31s)

[zero but we set them up with attached](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m34s)

[properties so as long as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m38s)

[or I should say typically an attached](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m40s)

[property will not have any behavior on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m43s)

[its own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m44s)

[I I put a little star next to that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m45s)

[because some people very much Implement](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m47s)

[things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m49s)

[behaviors with attached properties it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m50s)

[weird it can be done should be done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m53s)

[fairly generally attached properties](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m55s)

[don't have any behavior on their own and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m57s)

[so this grid row uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h37m58s)

[uh property here only has meaning if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m01s)

[it's inside of a grid right if I go and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m04s)

[slap this same grid row up on my dialog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m06s)

[Host this is meaningless it's not inside](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m08s)

[of a grid like does it do anything no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m10s)

[does it hurt anything I mean it causes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m13s)

[confusion but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m15s)

[and like I said technically row doesn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m18s)

[matter so now we can look we got a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m20s)

[button oh that's spanning the whole](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m22s)

[thing oh hang on let's do one more thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m24s)

[real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m26s)

[one other thing uh if we do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m27s)

[topmost true now it'll sit on top of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m30s)

[Visual Studio while I edit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m33s)

[oh nice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m35s)

[and then we'll just put you up here and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m36s)

[so we'll do something like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m38s)

[horizontal alignment right generally I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m40s)

[do this on multiple monitors but it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m43s)

[really hard to stream and show that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m44s)

[like usually I'll just set the app on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m47s)

[monitor two and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m48s)

[and then so now we got a button and we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m50s)

[want to open up the theme of bobber](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m53s)

[I want to click it I I agree](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h38m56s)

[um and so we can actually pop the thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m00s)

[open without doing any work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m02s)

[uh well and by by doing no work what I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m05s)

[clearly mean is doing a little bit of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m07s)

[work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m09s)

[uh see there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m13s)

[your host](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m19s)

[uh what is it open drawer command and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m20s)

[want to pass it a parameter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m23s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m25s)

[and I want it to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m28s)

[do I have to do an X I can't remember if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m30s)

[I have to do an X static here if I can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m32s)

[get away with just specifying it uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m34s)

[uh doc](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m37s)

[right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m39s)

[so if I do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m42s)

[whoop okay well we should probably put](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m43s)

[hang on let's let's put something in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m46s)

[in the the host so that we can actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m48s)

[see it hold on go pilot are you gonna be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m49s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m52s)

[come on Copilot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m54s)

[tell me that's pretty good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h39m58s)

[copilot you win for the night oh copilot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m00s)

[you are on point okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m04s)

[uh that didn't do what I expected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m07s)

[and I'm not sure if that's a hot reload](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m11s)

[problem so we're just going to relaunch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m14s)

[because I think that's correct would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m15s)

[that be right your content if we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m16s)

[opening it from the right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m19s)

[oh you know what we should probably put](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m21s)

[it on the right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m23s)

[so uh so is is that X colon static is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m28s)

[that just basically saying I'm just hard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m32s)

[coding the value here and not like it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m34s)

[not in my C sharp](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m37s)

[uh it is more akin to the static keyword](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m39s)

[in C sharp it's I want to reference a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m43s)

[static member of something directly and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m46s)

[sometimes static member will be like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m49s)

[enum value for example like in this case](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m51s)

[this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m54s)

[um this right dock](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m56s)

[Doc is an enum and right is just a value](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h40m58s)

[on it okay that makes sense so now we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m01s)

[have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m04s)

[nice yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m06s)

[so as long as you you both put the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m09s)

[content in the right drawer that you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m11s)

[talking about and then you open that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m12s)

[drawer it works the other thing that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m14s)

[that's really cool here that I'll point](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m17s)

[out for for people is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m19s)

[um we bound this up without actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m23s)

[doing a ton of work because of the way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m25s)

[this command property works so this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m29s)

[what's called a routed command in WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m32s)

[and this is one of its this is one of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m34s)

[its cool cool features is when this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m35s)

[command executes routed commands walk up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m38s)

[your xaml tree looking for somebody to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m41s)

[handle them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m44s)

[and so because this is inside of a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m46s)

[drawer host when this thing walks up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m48s)

[when it gets up to the drawer host the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m50s)

[door host goes hey I know how to handle](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m52s)

[that command and it goes great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m54s)

[doc right please and it goes yep and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m57s)

[opens the right dock for us so because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h41m59s)

[this is inside of the drawer host we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m01s)

[only have to do this if we wanted to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m04s)

[this and the drawer host wasn't in our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m06s)

[direct parent there is another parameter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m08s)

[called command Target that you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m10s)

[specify and you basically then just have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m13s)

[to Target the drawer host or something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m15s)

[inside of the drawer hose because the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m17s)

[command Target by default is yourself](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m18s)

[but you can make this command Target](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m20s)

[someone else if you need to like walk up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m22s)

[a different tree](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m24s)

[so which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m26s)

[just awesome and amazing and so so with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m28s)

[with the best practice there be to use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m31s)

[command and command parameter that stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m34s)

[if it's all like static data](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m36s)

[that you you can't like basically if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m39s)

[can do it in using those than to use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m41s)

[them otherwise use like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m44s)

[do things with commands they're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m46s)

[generally better oftentimes and we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m48s)

[get to this in a minute you're going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m50s)

[use commands that forward to methods in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m51s)

[your view model because most of the time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m54s)

[when a command gets executed you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m57s)

[probably want to do something in this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h42m59s)

[case it's really just UI type stuff that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m01s)

[we're doing so not having it hit the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m04s)

[view model is no big deal right we just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m06s)

[basically want to say yeah go on in and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m08s)

[maybe at some point we're going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m11s)

[change that and say well we'll do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m12s)

[something different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m13s)

[but for now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m14s)

[for now this much works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m16s)

[so let's put something in here and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m18s)

[think we're going to make this guy have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m22s)

[a bigger width to start with so how](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m23s)

[about a Min width of 300.](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m26s)

[yeah something like that maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m29s)

[can you so that's like an INT which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m31s)

[pixels can you do things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m34s)

[percentages or other types of ah so it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m36s)

[not actually pixels uh WPF does device](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m40s)

[independent pixels which means this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m46s)

[300 if your DPI on your monitor is set](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m48s)

[to 100 percent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m51s)

[so if you have like a high DPI screen](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m53s)

[it's going to get multiplied around for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m55s)

[you by the according percentage](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m57s)

[um but you are correct you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h43m59s)

[um in terms of doing percentages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m02s)

[cert you can't just arbitrarily slap in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m06s)

[like a 50 here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m08s)

[that's not a that's not a valid value](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m10s)

[um there are certain controls that allow](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m14s)

[it though and this is one of the things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m17s)

[that I like about grids because grids](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m18s)

[you'll note I set the height to Auto](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m21s)

[here Heights on things like grids and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m23s)

[let's close this so you can see it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m26s)

[um this I could set to do uh star sizing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m29s)

[which is effectively percentages so the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m33s)

[default behavior of each of the rows is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m35s)

[one star so one one piece of the pie](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m38s)

[which in this case is going to mean](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m41s)

[fifty percent unless we add a third row](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m43s)

[and then it means 33 percent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m45s)

[yeah very similar the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m49s)

[um the other thing you have is Auto and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m53s)

[then you also have fixed value so if I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m56s)

[say a hundred it's going to be a hundred](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h44m58s)

[no matter what and you can kind of see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m00s)

[it it's really hard to view but the oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m02s)

[the thing is sitting on top](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m06s)

[the the little scroll bars here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m09s)

[so you can kind of tell that that one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m11s)

[got moved down because I know the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m13s)

[default is one star for everything I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m15s)

[oftentimes will just omit it completely](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m17s)

[because this in my opinion reads fairly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m20s)

[cleanly that the first one has a height](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m23s)

[that is going to shrink to its content](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m24s)

[and the other one's just going to fill](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m26s)

[the remaining space](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m28s)

[so Auto so if you use like a few rows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m30s)

[with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m33s)

[like one star and then you had Auto like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m35s)

[Autos the least](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m38s)

[has the least priority](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m41s)

[um Auto has highest priority but it it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m45s)

[only allocates as much space as it needs](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m49s)

[to contain its children so for example](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m51s)

[if the button itself decided it wanted a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m54s)

[height of 300](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m56s)

[the auto column gets that 300 and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h45m58s)

[the the star sizing gets the the lowest](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m02s)

[priority evaluation](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m05s)

[I think it's actually fixed Dimension is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m07s)

[highest then Auto Then star sizing okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m09s)

[I can't remember it's rare that you have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m14s)

[all three in the same grid though](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m17s)

[yeah I rarely I rarely push it and I and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m20s)

[there so there's kind of side there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m23s)

[there are sort of things like that the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m26s)

[the real State the real scary thing here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m29s)

[is if you wanted to make this Min width](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m31s)

[here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m33s)

[um be a percentage the other thing you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m34s)

[we can do is we can like bind it to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m37s)

[width of the drawer host and do like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m40s)

[value converter to say well take the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m42s)

[value that's coming in and divide by two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m45s)

[or something so you can you can get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m47s)

[yourself to percentage sizing if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m49s)

[want it's just not something that you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m51s)

[get by like typing 50 percent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m52s)

[and this is somewhat of an artifact of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m54s)

[the fact that WPF is the best technology](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m56s)

[2005 has to offer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h46m59s)

[uh I'm only partly joking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m03s)

[um okay so let's do let's do a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m06s)

[bit here so usually I like a little bit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m08s)

[of margin around my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m10s)

[my stuff to give it a little bit of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m13s)

[height](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m17s)

[how about we do new game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m18s)

[to start and then I I have the material](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m20s)

[design demo app around just because I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m22s)

[might I feel like I might want it uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m25s)

[where's typography boom uh let's see we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m28s)

[might do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m32s)

[what do you think like a heading six](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m36s)

[Maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m38s)

[maybe that yeah that looks good or or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m41s)

[one one looks good too](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m44s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m46s)

[half the size of our window details](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m48s)

[details details so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m51s)

[copy that little line out come over here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m53s)

[go whoop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m56s)

[and we're gonna put space in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h47m57s)

[boom okay so we got a little styling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m00s)

[going there that looks nicer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m02s)

[um okay and so down below this so a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m05s)

[stack panel the other thing to know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m07s)

[about is it is only going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m09s)

[um it's going to compress everything to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m11s)

[fit its contents and by default stack](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m13s)

[panels are vertical but you can flip](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m15s)

[them horizontal if you need to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m17s)

[um so let's see we need probably a text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m20s)

[box or the name right text box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m27s)

[uh text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m30s)

[uh buying](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m33s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m36s)

[name and I really want this thing to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m37s)

[bound to a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m41s)

[kind of want this thing to have a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m44s)

[different data context than the catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m46s)

[I kind of feel like the contents inside](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m50s)

[of this flyout really need to be our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m52s)

[movie down here our game view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m55s)

[because that's kind of what we're going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m58s)

[to be building up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h48m59s)

[so now if I do binding I should see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m01s)

[things like our name property great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m04s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m06s)

[and then I would like it's styled a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m07s)

[little less ugly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m10s)

[so we come over here and we build fields](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m12s)

[and I go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m14s)

[which one of these looks prettiest](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m16s)

[do you like the outline the filled one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m20s)

[didn't they there's one of them that got](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m24s)

[oh they got rid of the just the naked](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m26s)

[single underline I mean I still have it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m28s)

[oh well is it it's like not part of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m31s)

[most recent material spec right because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m34s)

[if you look over confused by it the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m36s)

[material design three one yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m37s)

[um I like filled fields](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m41s)

[excellent we will do that then uh let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m44s)

[see here so we want this guy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m47s)

[and we're gonna go whoop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m51s)

[what is your problem air root level](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m55s)

[design one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m57s)

[I don't know what your problem is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h49m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m01s)

[uh levels so does an element just use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m04s)

[the closest data context to it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m08s)

[it will use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m11s)

[um like looking upwards from itself yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m14s)

[or more actually the data context flows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m17s)

[down so it doesn't necessarily look up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m20s)

[but one set at a root level will](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m22s)

[propagate down and this D data context](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m25s)

[although like doesn't actually set the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m30s)

[data context the fact that I've set this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m33s)

[here is a bold face lie](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m38s)

[that just gives you oh that was just the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m40s)

[designer thing to give you the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m43s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m45s)

[and I'm trying to figure out why it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m47s)

[unhappy air and data error](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m49s)

[oh it's because I've typed a zero at the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m53s)

[top and that is invalid XML okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m55s)

[now so when it was say in line one what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h50m59s)

[it meant is your [ __ ] look at line one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m01s)

[got it okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m03s)

[I had to blame copilot I probably did it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m05s)

[I wish I could I I'm gonna blame this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m07s)

[extra Joe person who's uh got editor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m10s)

[permissions that probably was me I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m12s)

[bleeding on my keyboard I mean it's it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m16s)

[possible okay so we've got that let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m18s)

[grab because we can do this kind of hint](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m21s)

[thing too](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m23s)

[let's give it a little let's slap a hint](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m24s)

[on there as well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m27s)

[um just so that it looks just so it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m29s)

[looks a little partier uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m31s)

[uh name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m36s)

[uh and apparently that doesn't work with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m39s)

[hot reloads that's exciting so I'm just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m41s)

[going to click the button real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m43s)

[this is one of the things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m46s)

[I prefer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m49s)

[doing the hot reload approach because it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m50s)

[shows what it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m52s)

[well that's interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m54s)

[why oh because I put the hint on the on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h51m57s)

[the text block not on the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m00s)

[so if you put it on the wrong thing it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m04s)

[doesn't show up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m07s)

[oh look at that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m09s)

[there we go so I I've got a question for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m11s)

[you is there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m13s)

[a way to basically](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m16s)

[instead of having to create your inputs](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m20s)

[like one at a time for all of your your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m23s)

[fields in like basically the form you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m25s)

[creating can you just say like here's my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m27s)

[view model look at the types and create](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m30s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m33s)

[this beautiful form for me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m34s)

[this is what's great about having](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m38s)

[somebody who knows nothing of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m40s)

[framework that would be a wonderful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m42s)

[feature](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m43s)

[that does not exist](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m44s)

[but it actually wouldn't be that hard to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m48s)

[build so in in Django I'll take it back](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m50s)

[to python because that's what I'm done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m54s)

[in Django there's this there's uh this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h52m56s)

[popular package called crispy forms](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m00s)

[where you basically it's kind of similar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m02s)

[like you have a context for your whole](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m04s)

[template which is like the equivalent of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m06s)

[this xaml file but HTML typically and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m09s)

[you can basically just pipe like a form](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m12s)

[object from your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m16s)

[context into this like it's crispy form](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m18s)

[function and it just like renders all of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m21s)

[your your form for you it makes it look](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m25s)

[real nice yeah mini 4G comments and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m27s)

[items control with data templates that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m30s)

[actually exactly what I was thinking of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m32s)

[is like it would not be terribly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m35s)

[difficult to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m37s)

[it require a minor amount of reflection](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m40s)

[but it's it's totally doable](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m44s)

[next live stream I mean I mean it's it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m49s)

[not a bad idea to build out the really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m52s)

[the the question being right like it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m55s)

[would not be hard if the I I immediately](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h53m57s)

[see the complexities coming with form](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m01s)

[layout and people wanting to customize](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m02s)

[it like well I want these two Fields](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m04s)

[side by side and then these next ones on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m06s)

[the next line like how do you start](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m08s)

[allowing that type of customization](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m10s)

[that's where I see things getting weird](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m12s)

[and so it like the way that crispy forms](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m16s)

[one works is it sort of gives you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m18s)

[different levels of granularity I guess](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m19s)

[where you can like just render the whole](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m22s)

[form and it'll just give you like you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m24s)

[can do some like setup in your settings](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m27s)

[file to kind of do Global level settings](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m29s)

[yeah but it'll just render the whole](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m32s)

[forum for you in whatever element you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m34s)

[plop it in or if you like you're saying](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m35s)

[like want to put two elements by each](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m37s)

[other you can like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m39s)

[give it just a specific field in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m40s)

[form and just plop it to the function](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m42s)

[it'll like render like instead of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m44s)

[deciding to use text box in the material](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m46s)

[design stuff it would just like do that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m49s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m51s)

[yeah I can see that being really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m52s)

[powerful I've contemplated going through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m54s)

[and building out some more complex WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m56s)

[controls like that like the other thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h54m59s)

[that I wish existed is I wish stack](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m01s)

[panel had a property to say hey put this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m03s)

[much margin between each item in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m06s)

[stack panel that's something that exists](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m07s)

[in some newer xaml Frameworks like Maui](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m10s)

[um but it doesn't really exist like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m13s)

[that's not a WPF thing and so people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m16s)

[have built like attached properties and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m19s)

[those are an example where people will](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m21s)

[put Behavior to it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m22s)

[um and I've thought about building some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m24s)

[of those things out because the number](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m25s)

[of times I've wanted that is kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m27s)

[high](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m29s)

[have you heard of uh or sorry go ahead](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m30s)

[no that was it carry on the uh the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m32s)

[lobotomized owl](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m35s)

[I I've heard all of those words in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m37s)

[isolation](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m40s)

[well it's just it's just two lobotomized](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m41s)

[an owl it's uh correct I know what each](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m44s)

[of those words mean independently but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m46s)

[this feels like one of those cases that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m48s)

[so if you it's the first link I I can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m50s)

[almost guarantee the first link you if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m53s)

[you Google that is this this article on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m54s)

[this front-end design website called the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m57s)

[list apart and it's basically this like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h55m59s)

[CSS thing where you do like Splat plus](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m01s)

[splat](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m04s)

[and it's like how you get like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m05s)

[space between your objects without](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m07s)

[actually like having to go into find it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m09s)

[on every object](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m12s)

[or you could do like a div plus div and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m15s)

[then you would do like margin top](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m18s)

[whatever and then I assume you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m19s)

[talking about this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m21s)

[my guarantee fell flat sorry no it was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m24s)

[not that one but it's probably the same](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m27s)

[idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m29s)

[um it's the reason you do that probably](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m30s)

[lobotomized owls are out there it's so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m32s)

[it's like basically like if you just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m36s)

[added margin to the top of all of like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m38s)

[class or an element then your top One's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m40s)

[Gonna Have margin and you probably don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m42s)

[want that you just want it in between so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m44s)

[it's selecting only elements that are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m47s)

[consecutive elements of the same type](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m50s)

[ah ah or class or whatever yes this see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m53s)

[this feels like the same idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m57s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h56m59s)

[yeah and that's one of the things that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m01s)

[like WPF styling engine is is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m03s)

[to some degree showing it's showing its](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m07s)

[age that's 2005-ness correct like it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m09s)

[there and things like Maui you have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m13s)

[added features like that to make it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m16s)

[better because people have wanted it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m19s)

[but yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m22s)

[oh there's okay thank you that's that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m24s)

[the one I was but it's probably the same](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m26s)

[so as far as the uh the like a component](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m29s)

[that just sort of you give it a field](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m32s)

[and it figures out what to render](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m34s)

[doesn't coalesce have something like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m36s)

[that for like it's it's view stuff it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m38s)

[does it does](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m41s)

[a c select or something and it just kind](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m43s)

[of knows what to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m47s)

[yeah I know it's not WPF no it so it and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m49s)

[it's totally fine](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m52s)

[um I'm just going to show this off for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m54s)

[people who who want to see it so for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m56s)

[anybody interested in the coalesce thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h57m58s)

[that he's talking about There's the link](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m00s)

[and then there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m01s)

[YouTube there is uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m11s)

[yeah top hit booyas Booyah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m12s)

[um you mean when you Google our name and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m17s)

[our framework we're at the top yeah but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m19s)

[notice whose channel it's on oh nice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m22s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m25s)

[so if anybody's interested there was I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m26s)

[at one point in time I I there was a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m29s)

[bunch of people interested in the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m31s)

[coalesce framework so I conned Grant and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m33s)

[Andrew arguably the uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m35s)

[the Creator and the the person who's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m39s)

[done the most work on it to go through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m42s)

[and actually uh build it out and they](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m43s)

[they came on and did a stream on it uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m46s)

[the stuff on the stream is mildly dated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m48s)

[because it's I think it's still back on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m50s)

[view too but if you look at the repo it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m52s)

[is updated to view three for anybody who](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m54s)

[cares Andrew very much likes to be on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m56s)

[latest greatest stuff and will actively](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h58m59s)

[update](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m01s)

[uh whenever given the freedom okay so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m02s)

[let's actually build okay so I want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m05s)

[do a couple things here one should this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m07s)

[thing be light dismiss](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m09s)

[like click to collapse yeah I mean as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m13s)

[long as it doesn't clear out the form](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m16s)

[okay like nothing worse than](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m18s)

[accidentally clicking off a form that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m20s)

[you've typed in a ton of information on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m22s)

[right and it's not it's not going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m23s)

[clear but because we can do uh the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m25s)

[there's a property we can set to turn](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m27s)

[the other Behavior off if we don't like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m29s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m30s)

[um let's come down here and then rather](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m31s)

[than having this guy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m33s)

[close the drawer this is this is where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m35s)

[we actually get to do something fun](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m38s)

[because at this point now we want to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m39s)

[some saving of thingies right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m40s)

[um and so now we run into a question of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m44s)

[how do we want to do this and I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m46s)

[actually wondering if this data context](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m48s)

[is even the right place to do it I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m49s)

[kind of thinking it's not so we might](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m51s)

[kill that off and in this case this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m53s)

[going to be something like new game name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m56s)

[all right so let's go back into our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=00h59m58s)

[catalog view model and I don't actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m00s)

[think I want this new game property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m02s)

[anymore I want an observable property I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m04s)

[want it to be a private string](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m07s)

[uh new game name boom new property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m11s)

[exists everyone's happy that's at a name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m15s)

[game name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m18s)

[in your C sharp](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m20s)

[thank you I'm glad to see you are living](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m23s)

[up to your role of correcting my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m26s)

[spelling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m27s)

[uh okay and then and then we have this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m30s)

[issue of we don't want this thing to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m33s)

[just close the drawer we want this thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m35s)

[to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m36s)

[save to the database and then do the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m37s)

[needful right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m41s)

[so let's let's go let's go ahead and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m42s)

[make something that does that so we do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m44s)

[uh private and it's going to be an async](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m48s)

[method so async task uh I don't know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m51s)

[save game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m54s)

[I can't decide if that's a reasonable](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m57s)

[name or not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h00m59s)

[we'll do it okay relay command poof](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m00s)

[bippity boppity boo yeah we have a save](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m02s)

[game command](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m04s)

[so now over here we go binding save game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m05s)

[command done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m10s)

[and this should probably be called](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m12s)

[something more like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m13s)

[save and you'll note I put an underscore](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m17s)

[in front of the s](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m19s)

[this is because Kevin likes accelerator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m21s)

[keys](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m25s)

[so what that means is if I type in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m26s)

[name here like Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m29s)

[and then I hit alt you see how the S](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m32s)

[gets an underscore under it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m34s)

[I can now go alt s so if you if you uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m36s)

[any of the content controls in WPF if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m42s)

[you just put an underscore in front of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m44s)

[the name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m46s)

[it will give you an accelerator key](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m47s)

[there this is the cause of much](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m49s)

[confusion online because so many people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m51s)

[are like why are my underscores not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m53s)

[showing up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m55s)

[well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m56s)

[that's why I assumed it was like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h01m58s)

[translation thing like to allow for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m01s)

[other languages oh no that would be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m06s)

[clever no no it's much simpler than that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m09s)

[okay so let's actually build out saving](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m10s)

[the game so the first thing we need is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m14s)

[our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m17s)

[let's see board game context so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m18s)

[I don't know and then let's slap it into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m23s)

[property add an old check do the needful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m26s)

[make you private because you don't need](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m30s)

[to be exposed outside put you at the top](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m32s)

[because I'm paranoid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m35s)

[and then okay so first thing we should](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m37s)

[do is we should probably not let](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m40s)

[somebody save if they haven't typed in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m41s)

[name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m43s)

[right that checks so private pool can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m44s)

[save game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m49s)

[and then we're gonna do with uh not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m51s)

[string is nolar white space uh new game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m54s)

[name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h02m58s)

[so you have private string underscore](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m00s)

[new game name down line 18 and then in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m03s)

[your xaml I think you were referencing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m07s)

[new game name yep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m12s)

[so is that that observable property is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m16s)

[what's adding that for you correct if we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m18s)

[go and look at the analyzers from the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m21s)

[community toolkit and we look at their](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m23s)

[Source generators or that's analyzer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m24s)

[where is their service generator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m27s)

[uh Community toolkit Source generator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m32s)

[observable property generator and I look](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m36s)

[at what they did to my catalog view](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m39s)

[model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m41s)

[this is the code that they generated so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m42s)

[I slap that little attribute on the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m44s)

[field and they generated up all of this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m46s)

[for me right right okay that's like so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m49s)

[that's how that's how I'm able to get it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m52s)

[so I just happen to know the convention](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m53s)

[and it's got all these partial methods](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m55s)

[and everything so you've got all these](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m58s)

[injection hooks if you want them you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h03m59s)

[know that's really cool that you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m02s)

[just go look in inside that folder and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m03s)

[see that yes it's not like hidden away](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m06s)

[from you yeah well more than that folder](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m09s)

[is I will say this oftentimes I run into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m11s)

[problems if the compile is failing for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m14s)

[some reason these often are out of date](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m16s)

[so I will just make that comment that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m20s)

[don't like and that could be the cause](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m22s)

[of a bit of confusion there is a an MS](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m25s)

[build property you can set on your CS](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m29s)

[project to also dump the generated files](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m30s)

[out to your OBG directory if you want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m33s)

[go look at them there as well which if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m35s)

[you're running into like compile issues](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m37s)

[caused by Source generators is often](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m40s)

[needed but these these things even](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m41s)

[though they look like files they aren't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m43s)

[real files](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m45s)

[like Source generators don't write to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m46s)

[disk because that would make them slower](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m48s)

[and sucky and we don't we are we are net](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m50s)

[dance we don't do that kind of crap so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m54s)

[think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m57s)

[just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m58s)

[I think go coalesce uses the dot g dot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h04m59s)

[CS naming convention for its generated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m03s)

[files but that that must be kind of a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m06s)

[totally different thing uh so the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m08s)

[dot g dot CS convention for the naming](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m11s)

[actually is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m13s)

[um something that a lot of tooling is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m16s)

[built around inside of visual studio in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m18s)

[ye olden days with like T4 Source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m21s)

[generators and like resx that was the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m23s)

[the convention that like because this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m27s)

[pre-source generators being a thing when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m30s)

[people actually like wrote code the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m31s)

[generated Source not Source generators](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m33s)

[things that generated Source very](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m35s)

[different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m37s)

[um they would oftentimes tack that dot g](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m39s)

[dot Cs and so there's a bunch of tooling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m41s)

[that's been built up to say oh if I see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m43s)

[that extension I know that this was a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m45s)

[generated file and not a user created](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m48s)

[file now there's nothing stopping you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m50s)

[from just making your own files with dot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m52s)

[g dot CS just don't do it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m53s)

[makes sense so for what it for what it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h05m57s)

[worth okay and then we want to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m00s)

[something like uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m02s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m05s)

[can execute so because we want this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m06s)

[method to be invoked uh name of can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m10s)

[save game so this can method I own this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m15s)

[is a kevinism I prefer to have my my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m20s)

[methods that determine if the relay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m23s)

[command can execute to be prefixed with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m25s)

[the word can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m26s)

[this is so how often is it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m29s)

[um running that method uh once when the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m32s)

[command is first bound and never again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m35s)

[which is a problem](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m39s)

[because we would like it updated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m41s)

[whenever this property changes so we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m43s)

[going to come up here and go notify can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m45s)

[execute change for name of save game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m48s)

[command now it's been edited every time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m51s)

[this property changes which is also not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m53s)

[good enough but I'll demonstrate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m56s)

[because this should probably this is one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h06m59s)

[of those things like there's so much](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m01s)

[magic and when you know the magic It's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m03s)

[amazing And you can do stuff quickly and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m04s)

[when you don't know the magic you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m06s)

[just left confused and banging your head](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m08s)

[against the wall](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m10s)

[so you'll note button disabled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m11s)

[rightfully so there's no name specified](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m13s)

[I type in Joe Buttons still disabled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m15s)

[this is not good I press tab](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m19s)

[button enable oh so it's yeah it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m22s)

[waiting for you to blur the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m25s)

[element](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m27s)

[in WPF we call it lost Focus but yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m28s)

[you are correct](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m32s)

[um but we can change this to because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m34s)

[this is expected to be a very short](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m38s)

[field like there's not going to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m40s)

[paragraphs of text written the easiest](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m42s)

[thing to do is say you know what I would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m44s)

[like you to update your Source on every](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m46s)

[single change](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m50s)

[so it's now going to Ping that property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m52s)

[every time you do a keystroke press](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m54s)

[which then triggering the property is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m57s)

[going to re-query that command and so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h07m59s)

[now as soon as I type J it updates](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m02s)

[nice and so now we can do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m05s)

[Twilight Imperium](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m08s)

[arguably one of the largest footprint](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m12s)

[games that I own okay uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m14s)

[we've got that see what this game is uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m18s)

[Twilight Imperium fourth edition](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m20s)

[there's an expansion that has recently](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m22s)

[come out my my set has been partially](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m25s)

[updated to the expansion](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m28s)

[for the like three people who care](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m30s)

[if you ever want to kill off a good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m34s)

[eight to ten hours let me know because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m36s)

[that's roughly how long a full a full](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m38s)

[game takes I like the worst Sun](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m41s)

[yes the the not a death star yes uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m45s)

[uh so we get in here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m51s)

[we should probably go through and we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m53s)

[have a game context and we have games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m55s)

[right board games yes so I need a new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h08m58s)

[board game object because I want to call](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m00s)

[add here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m02s)

[uh is this like Katan in space](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m03s)

[oh you see if I say yes to that people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m07s)

[are good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m10s)

[so I can't I can't say I can't say yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m12s)

[to that because it is significantly more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m15s)

[complex than that there is space combat](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m17s)

[there's diplomacy there's trade area of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m21s)

[control like there this game is massive](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m24s)

[have you ever live streamed your board](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m27s)

[games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m30s)

[no and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m31s)

[the the gaming group that I typically](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m34s)

[play with we've actually joked about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m36s)

[live streaming at times but we're also](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m37s)

[very conscious of the fact that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m40s)

[Sometimes some of the things that get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m43s)

[said during the board game we would not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m45s)

[want to be broadcast because sometimes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m47s)

[sometimes the arguments get a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m49s)

[heated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m51s)

[gotcha that that may or may not go well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m52s)

[I have done a grand total of I think two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m54s)

[board game streams and I think there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m57s)

[were ones on tabletop simulator if I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h09m59s)

[remember correctly with my buddy James](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m03s)

[I've contemplated it I've really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m05s)

[contemplated it's just if we do that I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m07s)

[have to go into it with the idea of okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m10s)

[everybody nobody get heated on this like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m12s)

[because there's especially in games like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m16s)

[Twilight Imperium there's backstabbing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m19s)

[there will be backstabbing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m21s)

[there will be people who make agreements](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m24s)

[and then promptly backstab their allies](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m26s)

[and it's glorious](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m28s)

[uh okay so board game we want name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m30s)

[gets a new game name so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m36s)

[this much here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m39s)

[and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m41s)

[I'm gonna just I'm just in a no call](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m44s)

[lesson so I don't have to think too hard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m46s)

[board game projects save changes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m49s)

[let's do it async save changes async oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m52s)

[wait we made this we made this an async](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m56s)

[method we might as well do the needful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h10m58s)

[okay so we got all that that's built](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m00s)

[that's wonderful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m02s)

[the things disabled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m04s)

[now the pro we have two problems with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m06s)

[what we've built](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m09s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m11s)

[we will demonstrate the problems](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m13s)

[problem one if I type in Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m17s)

[and I hit save](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m21s)

[one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m23s)

[because I've switched the command that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m24s)

[being executed actually I'll put a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m26s)

[breakpoint here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m27s)

[just to prove that we're actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m28s)

[getting in here right whoop so break](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m29s)

[point yay break point we create we do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m32s)

[the needful we save changes everyone's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m34s)

[happy great I've now inserted two rows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m36s)

[into my database with the name of Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m38s)

[my flyout is no longer closed this thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m41s)

[should probably clear on success](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m44s)

[none of that interaction we've broken](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m48s)

[all of the interaction right exactly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m50s)

[none of it happened I mean we saved it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m53s)

[we saved it to the database but we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m55s)

[not populating the collection anywhere](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h11m57s)

[like none of this stuff is actually like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m00s)

[doing what we want so if you if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m02s)

[start up the app and I don't know if we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m05s)

[got to the point where we're rendering](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m07s)

[like the game titles](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m09s)

[but those two games the objects would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m11s)

[show up if we were listing those in that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m14s)

[Grid at this point let's populate those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m15s)

[real quick shall we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m17s)

[um and I think we did something similar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m19s)

[on The View rentals](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m21s)

[right is we did a on refresh and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m24s)

[believe we just invoked this guy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m28s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m30s)

[s didn't we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m32s)

[oh we did it we just went through the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m36s)

[command I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m38s)

[yeah so we did we did this on loaded so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m40s)

[this is one of the things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m44s)

[when the control is loaded we go through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m46s)

[and populate those so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m48s)

[I think something similar here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m50s)

[is we'll go in here and we'll say](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m52s)

[uh loaded new event handler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h12m56s)

[great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m00s)

[code behind we got an event handle oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m02s)

[file sculpted namespace boom yay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m04s)

[indentation okay uh if data context is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m07s)

[uh catalog remodel remodel right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m13s)

[view model and then we need to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m18s)

[something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m20s)

[um I don't know if we want a refresh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m23s)

[button on these or if we just wanted to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m25s)

[do have a method that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m27s)

[public](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m29s)

[async task uh load games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m32s)

[because we should probably do something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m36s)

[to load the games right I think yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m37s)

[so and then I think we can do away for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m40s)

[each](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m45s)

[uh board game game in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m46s)

[in contacts board games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m51s)

[do the needful and then we need to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m54s)

[uh games dot add new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h13m57s)

[game view model passing in the game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m01s)

[we don't have a Constructor that's a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m05s)

[problem but we'll come back to that in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m07s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m08s)

[this guy would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m09s)

[go ahead how come you prefer doing the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m11s)

[for each Loop over like link methods](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m14s)

[could you do that in link using like an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m19s)

[async uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m22s)

[or for each I don't know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m25s)

[yeah so this will this is actually this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m28s)

[is actually not a 4-H loop I can see the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m32s)

[confusion by because I use the word for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m34s)

[each in the name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m36s)

[whoever said C sharp was either](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m39s)

[this is abusing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m45s)

[um a a newish language feature so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m47s)

[similar to how like you would hinted at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m50s)

[link doing the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m52s)

[um deferred execution where you have the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m54s)

[um enumerator and you just iterate one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m57s)

[at a time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h14m59s)

[there's a weight in front of the four](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m00s)

[each is turning this into a async and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m01s)

[numerator so this is actually just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m06s)

[pulling out one row from the database at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m08s)

[a time so under the hood depending on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m11s)

[your database implementation EF core](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m14s)

[will grab a cursor to your database](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m16s)

[table](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m19s)

[and database cursors are very similar to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m19s)

[link](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m23s)

[I enumerator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m24s)

[objects where they have a move next give](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m27s)

[me current type pattern where it's just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m30s)

[iterate iterate iterate so what this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m32s)

[actually doing is creating up one of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m34s)

[those pulling one of them back and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m36s)

[adding into it a lot of people will do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m39s)

[things like you know to list async or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m41s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m44s)

[the problem is is that re builds up a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m45s)

[list in memory first and then dumps this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m48s)

[out whereas this will start populating](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m51s)

[immediately so in the event that we have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m54s)

[a large board game collection we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m56s)

[start to see records getting added going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h15m58s)

[really quickly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m00s)

[and they'll come in as as the individual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m02s)

[row is ready now do you want that or do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m05s)

[you want it to be a full drop in that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m07s)

[kind of a judgment call](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m10s)

[so is this um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m11s)

[so this is making a database](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m13s)

[call yep using cursors for every board](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m16s)

[game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m20s)

[using a single cursor for the board](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m21s)

[games table and iterating over each row](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m24s)

[that seems like it could be problematic](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m28s)

[if your database was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m30s)

[far](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m35s)

[it's possible versus versus bringing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m36s)

[back the whole thing is one big set or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m39s)

[like paging through it like give me a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m41s)

[hundred at a time or something like that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m43s)

[certainly certainly certainly so if we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m45s)

[if we wanted to actually implement](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m47s)

[um paging or similar right you would do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m50s)

[something you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m53s)

[take a hundred or what is it uh does not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m54s)

[contain](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h16m59s)

[yeah so this take will end up breaking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m00s)

[it there's a I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m03s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m04s)

[you have to be careful between which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m06s)

[extension methods you use for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m08s)

[pulling back for between which ones are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m11s)

[I queryable and which ones are I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m14s)

[innumerable because the queryable ones](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m15s)

[send the expression to the database to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m17s)

[be evaluated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m20s)

[right versus the enumerable ones which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m21s)

[pull it back](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m23s)

[um and then and there are is it chunk](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m25s)

[that does it no that's my own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m29s)

[no it's not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m31s)

[there are there are various ones that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m34s)

[that go ahead and bring different ones](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m37s)

[back for doing it in general the cursor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m39s)

[is not actually that expensive for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m41s)

[bringing back one record at a time it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m44s)

[usually fairly efficient because it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m46s)

[going to be bringing back one especially](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m48s)

[if what you care about is seeing the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m50s)

[initial collection populated quickly and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m53s)

[you like say there's 50 000 right if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m56s)

[like user hasn't scrolled yet we can if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h17m59s)

[if it takes me a while to get the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m02s)

[subsequent you know forty thousand to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m04s)

[load up not a big deal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m06s)

[wow fifty thousand board games I don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m08s)

[know how you even store that many](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m10s)

[there's a physical limitation even on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m12s)

[the tiny board like 50 000 decks of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m14s)

[cards that's a lot of decks of cards](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m16s)

[I have two yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m19s)

[I don't even have that many okay let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m22s)

[real quick get this Constructor going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m24s)

[uh board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m27s)

[all right uh let's see argument null](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m31s)

[exception throw if no okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m34s)

[so isn't there like the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m38s)

[I don't know maybe it was in like C](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m43s)

[sharp eight or something where you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m44s)

[like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m46s)

[enable a it's like a null free region or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m47s)

[you don't need to do these null checks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m51s)

[all over yes so we do have no ability](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m52s)

[enabled I am paranoid though because the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m55s)

[knowable reference types are only as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h18m59s)

[good as they are documented and so one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m00s)

[could make a very compelling argument](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m04s)

[that inside of this app this null check](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m05s)

[is completely meaningless because I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m08s)

[control every invocation of this method](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m11s)

[if you're building a library](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m13s)

[unless you can control the consumers in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m16s)

[some way you can't make that assumption](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m18s)

[because somebody could consume your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m19s)

[library and not have that turned on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m22s)

[um gotcha I'm still paranoid and I I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m25s)

[still null check things coming in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m27s)

[because I would much rather get an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m29s)

[argument no exception with a useful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m31s)

[parameter name then a no reference](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m32s)

[exception and a line number](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m34s)

[makes sense](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m37s)

[um and does c-sharp have uh what is like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m39s)

[zero cost exception handling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m41s)

[I don't know that I could explain that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m45s)

[very well but I know it's a it was a big](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m47s)

[deal in Python land that they added it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m49s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m52s)

[I'm gonna go with I don't think so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m54s)

[only because I know exceptions are one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h19m58s)

[of the most expensive things we can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m00s)

[create](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m04s)

[because instantiated an exception is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m05s)

[actually fairly expensive because it has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m08s)

[to go back and build up the stack Trace](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m10s)

[that's one of the biggest hits like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m12s)

[sorry I didn't explain that very well so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m16s)

[it's basically like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m18s)

[the way it works in Python is like if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m19s)

[you have like a try catch or it's in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m21s)

[Python's try except the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m25s)

[there's zero cost if it doesn't hit the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m29s)

[accept Clause whereas there used to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m32s)

[some level of overhead however small got](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m35s)

[it uh so yes we do have what I assume to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m39s)

[be the equivalent without fully](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m43s)

[understanding the feature](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m45s)

[um they would call it or I should say we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m46s)

[would call it exception filters right so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m49s)

[try catch exception e](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m51s)

[um we would do a when e you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m56s)

[uh e Dot message](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h20m59s)

[contains](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m03s)

[Joe oh that's pretty sweet right so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m05s)

[can do I can do this or or something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m07s)

[similar to this and so we can then then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m10s)

[we don't eat the cost of stopping at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m14s)

[this catch block because if you have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m17s)

[stop at the catch block do some work and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m19s)

[then do a throw](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m21s)

[you eat that cost versus an exception](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m23s)

[filter where if you can tell it to not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m25s)

[stop there and it it can then just keep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m28s)

[looking up the stack for where it needs](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m30s)

[to be handled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m32s)

[um a really great way to make a really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m34s)

[horrible bug is if the code inside of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m36s)

[this wed method itself throws an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m39s)

[exception that's bad](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m41s)

[don't do that you will not like the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m44s)

[results you end up with losing your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m47s)

[original exception and you're you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m50s)

[going down like it's it's bad don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m52s)

[don't yeah if you write an exception](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m54s)

[filter make it not throw exceptions](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h21m57s)

[and that does not mean wrap it up in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m00s)

[method and try to catch the whole thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m03s)

[that's that's also not this if you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m05s)

[trying catching inside of an exception](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m07s)

[filter you're doing something wrong](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m09s)

[very very very wrong but the exception](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m11s)

[filters can be quite good for when you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m15s)

[want to filter down it's like I would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m16s)

[like to catch exceptions a b or c type](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m18s)

[right rather than the other syntax and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m20s)

[have them all hit the same method](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m23s)

[okay gotcha so we have all that we've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m25s)

[built this up we've got load board games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m28s)

[now if we launch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m30s)

[it's going to be ugly so let's make it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m33s)

[not ugly really quick so this items](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m35s)

[control is going to show all of our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m38s)

[um all of our games and we're gonna do a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m42s)

[real quick data template](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m45s)

[um this is this is in my opinion one of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m48s)

[the the awesomeness things of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m51s)

[WPF flame okay we're just going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m55s)

[collapse that I want all of my space so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m57s)

[in this case I want to use local colon](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h22m59s)

[game view model great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m03s)

[so this this explicitly has or I should](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m05s)

[say has implicitly told it what I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m12s)

[what the data context will be because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m14s)

[this is going to be a template for each](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m16s)

[item in the collection so we've subtly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m17s)

[switched data context inside of this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m20s)

[and in this case we're just going to go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m23s)

[with text block text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m25s)

[uh binding name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m27s)

[just so that we have something to see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m30s)

[this template probably needs to be built](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m31s)

[out a little more to be cooler and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m34s)

[prettier and happier](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m36s)

[and then we launch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m38s)

[and that binding is is two ways if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m43s)

[you're doing something like an inputs](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m47s)

[value where you can change it ah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m50s)

[or is it one way that is a great](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m53s)

[question it depends](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m55s)

[um so see we got two Joes yay so we have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h23m58s)

[managed you twice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m02s)

[um so the the mo so buy needs themselves](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m04s)

[do have a mode property on here uh WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m07s)

[we have a lot more than one way we have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m10s)

[one way two way one way to Source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m13s)

[because we like one-way streets going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m16s)

[both directions it's like downtown](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m18s)

[Spokane we have one time for if you just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m19s)

[want to do it once to be done and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m22s)

[you have default which is what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m24s)

[everything defaults to now the beautiful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m26s)

[thing about default is you actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m27s)

[don't know whether it's one way or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m30s)

[two-way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m31s)

[under which The Binding is sent to so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m36s)

[the the text property on a text block](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m39s)

[if we go here and find](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m42s)

[uh uh text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m45s)

[where are you it was it was there it was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m48s)

[I realized the this is this is the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m51s)

[um this is not the actual hang on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m55s)

[this is not what I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h24m58s)

[um this is the my decompiler is lying to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m00s)

[me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m02s)

[so if we go here and go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m03s)

[text block dot text property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m06s)

[so and maybe I should actually switch so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m12s)

[here is how it's actually implemented](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m15s)

[is there's the thing that we set it up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m18s)

[against](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m20s)

[but our binding engine isn't actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m21s)

[going to this property that would make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m23s)

[sense no no our binding engine is going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m25s)

[against this dependency property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m28s)

[and this dependency property has a has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m30s)

[additional metadata that calls out the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m34s)

[type of the property and all of that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m36s)

[this is how the binding engine is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m38s)

[fundamentally implemented at the base](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m40s)

[level of WPF is this whole thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m41s)

[declares extra stuff about the property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m44s)

[and the the property metadata is what uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m48s)

[ultimately declares your your binding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m52s)

[mode and you'll know this one's not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m55s)

[explicitly setting anything but if we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m56s)

[look at text box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h25m58s)

[to poop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m02s)

[you'll note here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m04s)

[this guy very similar I've switched to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m07s)

[text box not text block but you'll note](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m09s)

[there's this extra thing down here that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m12s)

[says hey here's the default](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m14s)

[for it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m16s)

[so yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m19s)

[okay yes that makes sense so the the D](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m21s)

[the the default mode of your binding is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m23s)

[governed by the property under which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m27s)

[it's bound to which you have to look if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m29s)

[it's dependency property declaration to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m31s)

[know its default state in general though](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m34s)

[if it's an interactable property it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m37s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m39s)

[um to two-way and if it's a uh oh I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m40s)

[sorry this guy I highlighted the wrong](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m44s)

[thing bytes two-way by default if it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m46s)

[an interactable property it'll bind](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m48s)

[two-way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m51s)

[um by default if it's not a an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m52s)

[interactive property it will generally](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m55s)

[be one way and that's true for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m57s)

[everything in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h26m58s)

[um WPF land but that doesn't stop some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m01s)

[third-party developer from going that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m03s)

[dumb I'm changing it from my property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m05s)

[because my property should be two-way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m07s)

[for reasons](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m09s)

[does does C sharp not have a way to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m12s)

[like passing arguments by their keyword](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m17s)

[or like the parameter name because I see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m20s)

[all these comments it's like the name of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m22s)

[the parameter oh this is I I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m24s)

[probably uh artifact of the age of it so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m28s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m31s)

[youth code that's been around for a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m33s)

[while yeah so like for example here uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m34s)

[let's go and find a method that actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m38s)

[has a parameter so if I do a new uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m39s)

[catalog see this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m45s)

[learning moment right I can do game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m47s)

[context colon and then you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m49s)

[something like this so you can always](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m52s)

[specify the names of your parameters if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m54s)

[you want to pass them in that way oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m56s)

[okay which is it like uh do you have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h27m58s)

[do positional ones first and then named](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m01s)

[yes yeah it's uh it's oftentimes used](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m03s)

[for methods](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m06s)

[um that have a bunch of optional](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m08s)

[parameters where it's like I only want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m09s)

[to specify this optional one over here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m11s)

[okay but yes all the positional or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m14s)

[non-optional ones first and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m16s)

[and then you you only have to specify](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m19s)

[the name the name is only required when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m21s)

[you want to jump like if you if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m24s)

[declare everything in order by type the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m27s)

[cloud goes oh I'm fine that's that works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m29s)

[but sometimes people will still specify](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m31s)

[the name just for clarity like if you've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m34s)

[got a method that takes five ins](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m35s)

[um what like I don't know like so maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m38s)

[if it's something like a point and you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m40s)

[take in two ins I can probably infer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m42s)

[what they are but like some of like the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m44s)

[opencv libraries they invert their X and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m46s)

[y's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m49s)

[like I always think X comes before y](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m50s)

[' right but some libraries do y the next](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m54s)

[and I I realize they actually call it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m56s)

[row column it's like but that means y](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h28m58s)

[comes before X and my brain hurts and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m02s)

[get them backwards and on the like every](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m05s)

[time I interacted with those I always](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m07s)

[would specifying the names because my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m09s)

[brain couldn't Rock](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m11s)

[that makes sense okay so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m14s)

[uh next thing we want to do is we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m17s)

[to clear this guy out on a successful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m20s)

[save so that'll be easy we'll just do a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m22s)

[new game name gets null](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m25s)

[boom done because if we get past the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m27s)

[save changes that means the database](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m30s)

[save worked](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m31s)

[so that should be able to get us yet one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m33s)

[more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m35s)

[is there any reason you would want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m35s)

[set that to an empty string over a null](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m37s)

[um it won't actually matter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m40s)

[um at the end of the day The Binding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m43s)

[like the text box itself is gonna not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m46s)

[send a null it's going to put in an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m49s)

[empty string so as soon as any change](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m51s)

[occurs it's going to just push empty](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m52s)

[string down it'll push either empty](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m54s)

[string or whatever's in there so if we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m56s)

[do Foo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m58s)

[right at least now it's at least now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h29m59s)

[it's clearing and the last thing we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m02s)

[to do is close up this this guy here and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m03s)

[we also don't have a good way of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m07s)

[reloading that list yet so we just have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m09s)

[to relaunch the app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m11s)

[and then Foo shows up and everyone's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m13s)

[happy yay Foo okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m18s)

[so this is where oftentimes people get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m19s)

[really confused because they're like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m22s)

[well what do I do and there's a couple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m24s)

[ways to go through and handle this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m25s)

[situation so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m28s)

[option a drawer host has a property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m30s)

[that's like is Right drawer open so we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m33s)

[could just give ourselves a property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m36s)

[that's a Bool that we could drive that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m38s)

[goes open close open close open close](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m42s)

[right like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m43s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m46s)

[drawer open](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m48s)

[right and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m50s)

[The View model comes in here and we do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m51s)

[something like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m53s)

[observable property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m58s)

[uh private pool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h30m59s)

[open boom right we can come over here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m02s)

[and go draw open gets false](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m06s)

[all right this is option A](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m09s)

[it is so cool I've just got to say that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m13s)

[you're getting intellisense over](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m18s)

[Source generated stuff yeah it's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m22s)

[and it's because it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m25s)

[what like compiled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m29s)

[I don't know I don't know if that's the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m30s)

[right word there I would say it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m32s)

[generated well it's the tooling support](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m34s)

[around it because the source generators](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m36s)

[are executed as part of the the compiler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m39s)

[itself but actually getting that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m42s)

[intellisense requires kind of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m45s)

[language service to do its job which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m48s)

[it's doing background compilations which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m49s)

[is how it then knows all the information](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m51s)

[to be able to push it through I like my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m53s)

[opinion is dot net devs we have been](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m56s)

[spoiled for years with awesome tooling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h31m59s)

[like a lot of languages Maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m02s)

[superior but on my our tooling's awesome](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m05s)

[like yeah frankly flat out awesome](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m09s)

[this is like I always like the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m12s)

[the one of the double-edged swords if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m16s)

[you will of like python or more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m19s)

[specifically Django is Jango does like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m21s)

[bunch of dynamic stuff like it adds](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m24s)

[things to your model classes but the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m26s)

[horrible part of it is you get no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m30s)

[intellisense or like you're if you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m32s)

[using a type checker](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m35s)

[it basically just like you either have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m36s)

[to do sort of some weird workarounds](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m40s)

[or just like kind of do the eject which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m42s)

[is just add like a type ignore and it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m46s)

[basically just disables like the typing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m48s)

[the type checking for the whole line](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m50s)

[right it kind of mitigates the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m51s)

[usefulness of the feature yeah so like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m53s)

[yeah but C sharp it's like you've got](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m57s)

[your cake and you're eating it too here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h32m59s)

[you've got Dynamic stuff in a different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m00s)

[way but you still get your intellisense](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m03s)

[consider this like recovery session one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m06s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m09s)

[uh okay so that Boolean works and we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m11s)

[could certainly drive it that way as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m14s)

[well the only thing like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m16s)

[this is a pattern I see people do a lot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m19s)

[and it totally works like this this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m21s)

[works the only thing that gives me a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m24s)

[small twitch factor is this is sort of a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m26s)

[very leaky abstraction where now the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m31s)

[view model is making assumptions about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m32s)

[what the view needs and to some degree](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m35s)

[it's the fact that I've named it drawer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m38s)

[open right like view models should never](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m40s)

[contain UI objects in them but I've now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m42s)

[named a property with a UI class name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m45s)

[and so it's like yeah like you could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m47s)

[argue that maybe if I renamed it it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m50s)

[cleaned it up and I'm like it like it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m52s)

[works it totally works like this it yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m54s)

[it's just a twitch fact so another](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h33m57s)

[approach that I like and this this works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m00s)

[because the property in question is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m04s)

[bindable this this pattern also falls](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m06s)

[apart if the thing you want to toggle](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m08s)

[isn't a bindable property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m10s)

[so the other option is doing something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m12s)

[and I might even do it down in my data](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m15s)

[level](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m18s)

[right so I could do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m23s)

[uh student new class here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m25s)

[and do something like uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m28s)

[board game created](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m32s)

[right and we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m35s)

[public record class file scope and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m37s)

[namespace and clean this up and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m42s)

[you do because we don't even need curly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m44s)

[braces anymore we are that cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m46s)

[um okay so we got basically an empty](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m49s)

[class that doesn't do anything which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m52s)

[exactly what we need](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m54s)

[um and if we come over here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m57s)

[nope not you you and we give ourselves](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h34m59s)

[one more itty-bitty little dependency](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m02s)

[called an eye messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m04s)

[so where is that coming from uh it is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m07s)

[Magic](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m10s)

[um or but like where's that interface](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m13s)

[Define ah so that interface is something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m15s)

[that is also coming from the uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m18s)

[Community toolkit mvvm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m21s)

[and then specifically our di](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m23s)

[registration for it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m25s)

[um is right here so I specifically have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m28s)

[said hey for anybody who asked for an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m31s)

[iMessenger we're gonna feed them the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m34s)

[weak reference messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m36s)

[it's a also a strong reference messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m38s)

[um and the whole idea with this is he's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m42s)

[a pub sub model right he can publish](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m43s)

[messages people can subscribe to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m46s)

[messages and by being a weak reference](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m48s)

[one he's not going to hold references to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m50s)

[those people who have subscribed to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m52s)

[messages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m54s)

[right because we don't want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m55s)

[accidentally have him hold because he](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m56s)

[tends to be a very globally type object](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h35m57s)

[I really don't want him holding on to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m00s)

[references to things because that could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m02s)

[keep things alive for ages and I just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m03s)

[don't want that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m05s)

[so we use the weak reference one but in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m06s)

[this case all we're going to do is we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m09s)

[going to save him and down here what we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m10s)

[can do is we can go messenger send new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m12s)

[board game created](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m17s)

[okay and again this is It's a minor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m20s)

[thing minor thick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m24s)

[um we can then come up here in our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m26s)

[um in our view and say you know what it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m29s)

[would be really nice if we could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m31s)

[register for this guy right like I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m32s)

[I want this messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m35s)

[and I'm intentionally doing it this way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m38s)

[just so that I have a reference I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m39s)

[to do something like messenger uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m42s)

[register all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m45s)

[this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m46s)

[and then this guy here as long as he](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m48s)

[implements an i recipient](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m50s)

[of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m53s)

[board game created](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h36m55s)

[don't fix formatting Implement interface](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m00s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m02s)

[down here what this guy can do is he can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m03s)

[say okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m06s)

[if I give my my drawer host a name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m07s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m11s)

[we will call our drawer host drawer host](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m12s)

[because that won't be confusing at all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m14s)

[then this guy here can go uh is right or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m17s)

[open false](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m20s)

[so this is a lot of the direction to set](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m23s)

[the exact same property just to be clear](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m27s)

[a lot of indirection for the exact same](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m30s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m32s)

[so if you're actually going to do it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m34s)

[that way you would add iMessenger as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m35s)

[like using di like you would just move](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m37s)

[it to the Constructor of the catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m39s)

[view correct and then have this go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m42s)

[through and do it and then the only the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m44s)

[only net the only thing we've gained by](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m46s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m48s)

[is now the catalog view model isn't this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m49s)

[leaky abstraction all it knows is that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m52s)

[hey when we've saved a game I clear out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m54s)

[my previous state and then I just notify](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m57s)

[the rest of the app that I created at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h37m59s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m01s)

[I don't think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m02s)

[and actually we might even go as far as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m05s)

[to say a weight load games AC](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m07s)

[right and this guy should probably](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m10s)

[GameStop clear](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m12s)

[that way when we add one we can reload](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m16s)

[so why did you put it I'm surprised you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m17s)

[chose to put the board game created](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m21s)

[inside your data folder ah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m23s)

[because I secretly have aspirations](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m27s)

[because I secretly have ideas that it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m34s)

[might be cool to rather than have it no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m36s)

[bad copilot that's not what I wanted try](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m39s)

[again](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m43s)

[because I was kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m44s)

[on some other projects I've done things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m46s)

[where I do like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m49s)

[save changes right and then based upon](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m51s)

[what has changed here we go through and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m54s)

[post out messages to say hey by the way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m57s)

[the following stuff was created that way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h38m59s)

[the view model doesn't need to remember](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m00s)

[to post the message](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m02s)

[The View model can just be blind and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m04s)

[stupid and say I saved to the database](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m06s)

[but then the DB context goes I got you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m09s)

[let me go ahead and post some messages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m12s)

[out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m13s)

[secretly I've already done this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m15s)

[you're gonna pull the the cake out of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m20s)

[the oven](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m22s)

[well so this whole this whole thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m23s)

[started](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m26s)

[um remember how we we had this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m28s)

[discussion at one of our meetings about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m29s)

[building budget applications because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m31s)

[every developer apparently this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m32s)

[something every developer must build at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m34s)

[some point is their own budgeting app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m36s)

[um I've I've clearly done that already](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m38s)

[because and it's a WPF app because my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m40s)

[user base all one of them really wanted](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m43s)

[a WPF app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m45s)

[but on my DB context here you'll note it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m48s)

[takes in a messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m52s)

[share link if anybody's interested](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m53s)

[um it takes in a iMessenger and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h39m57s)

[down inside of my save changes you'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m00s)

[note that it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m03s)

[it I arguably jumped through some hoops](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m04s)

[that were probably more than needed to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m07s)

[be jumped through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m09s)

[but it it then goes through all of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m10s)

[items that were changed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m12s)

[it's got this whole like I did code](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m14s)

[based DB triggers](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m18s)

[because reasons](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m21s)

[I yes I'm aware that there's third party](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m23s)

[libraries yes I did it anyway right but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m25s)

[then I go through and I look at the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m28s)

[event type of oh is this a new record](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m30s)

[are we updating an existing record and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m31s)

[then it goes through and registers up a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m34s)

[bunch of messages to be posted about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m37s)

[where they're going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m39s)

[I don't know if this is necessarily](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m42s)

[better but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m44s)

[the this seems to me like if you went](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m46s)

[really heavy on this sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m50s)

[uh like event driven design it could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m54s)

[start to get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m58s)

[somewhat complex like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h40m59s)

[where stuff is coming from absolutely a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m02s)

[hundred percent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m05s)

[um and that's where this this is also](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m07s)

[something that I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m10s)

[necessarily scales out well for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m11s)

[cloud-based setups this is also where a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m13s)

[lot of people will push for like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m16s)

[repository pattern](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m18s)

[where rather than having your view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m20s)

[act on the DB context directly there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m22s)

[some sort of say board game repository](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m25s)

[class](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m28s)

[and it exposes methods like create board](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m30s)

[game right and it's responsible for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m33s)

[building up the the data objects saving](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m36s)

[it to the database sending the message](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m38s)

[and all of that through and then and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m40s)

[then nothing else goes to the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m43s)

[database directly everything flows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m45s)

[through these uh repository patterns and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m47s)

[so there's a centralized place to wrap](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m49s)

[up all of that logic this arguably](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m51s)

[flattens that all into one place and you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m53s)

[are correct could get very confusing at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m56s)

[times](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h41m59s)

[so for what it's worth that's the only](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m01s)

[reason I put it there is because that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m03s)

[was the the structure](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m05s)

[I don't know which way we actually want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m07s)

[to do this like one could argue that a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m09s)

[cleaner option is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m13s)

[to pull this guy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m15s)

[and just use the The View model the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m19s)

[other thing that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m22s)

[is I can't do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m25s)

[oh oh okay that's that's what I was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m28s)

[thinking how you would add that that is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m31s)

[that is exactly what we want to do but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m33s)

[this doesn't actually work right now and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m34s)

[the only reason this doesn't work right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m36s)

[now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m38s)

[is because I don't have these views](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m39s)

[being di injected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m43s)

[um and specifically because these views](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m45s)

[live at this level](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m47s)

[right now we could go and fix that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m50s)

[that's a thing we could change but WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m52s)

[was built before a lot of di well I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m56s)

[won't say before di was really a big](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h42m59s)

[thing it wasn't a a driving pattern](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m01s)

[right the idea of the view models and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m03s)

[the data context being di injected was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m06s)

[sort of one of the things that WPF went](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m10s)

[yeah that's not our problem to solve](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m12s)

[which is really unfortunate because like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m15s)

[when they shipped they shipped without](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m18s)

[things like arguably they should have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m20s)

[had a relay command in the Box the facts](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m22s)

[that I had to like there's no relay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m25s)

[command implementation in the box with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m28s)

[WPF everybody either rolls their own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m29s)

[implementation of I command or pulls a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m32s)

[third party Library you should pull the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m34s)

[third party Library](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m36s)

[um is there a newer version or uh like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m38s)

[newer way of doing desktop apps using](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m42s)

[c-sharp there are so the the current](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m46s)

[Forerunner options are so Maui is one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m49s)

[because Maui Maui's the the cross](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m52s)

[platform the multiple you what is it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m55s)

[multiple application UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h43m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m02s)

[and it will let you build a desktop app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m02s)

[with their version of xaml because xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m05s)

[is versioned itself and they've got the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m08s)

[latest 2009 I think is the version and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m10s)

[it adds things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m13s)

[um compiled bindings and generics which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m15s)

[is cool because WPF saml doesn't even](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m17s)

[have generics because it came out before](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m19s)

[generics did so that's not a thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m21s)

[um which is kind of unfortunate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m25s)

[um the other front runner is Win ui3](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m28s)

[which is what the Maui application](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m31s)

[actually produces for the desktop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m34s)

[um win ui3 is is supposed to be the WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m38s)

[killer because it has the xamli setup](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m41s)

[you can do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m45s)

[basically all the same stuff that you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m46s)

[would do in WPF only when you I3 the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m48s)

[problem is it hasn't quite reached](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m51s)

[feature parity and some of the stuff is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m52s)

[just a metric pain in the butt to use](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m55s)

[the Windows app like WPF is Trivial you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h44m57s)

[you install the workload in Visual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m00s)

[Studio you go file new project you give](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m02s)

[it a name you hit enter and you're done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m05s)

[when ui3 a little bit bigger of a pain](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m09s)

[in the butt](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m11s)

[um and for a lot and that's a first](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m13s)

[party Library yes and it's supposed to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m15s)

[be it's so it has some features in it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m18s)

[that like for example if we take the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m20s)

[calculator app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m23s)

[right you'll note that uh the calculator](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m25s)

[may be a bad example especially in Dark](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m27s)

[theme the some of the Windows apps](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m29s)

[you'll note you get that acrylic it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m31s)

[not a transparent look through because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m33s)

[that's a security thing of all things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m35s)

[um but you can get that acrylic look in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m39s)

[the background that's something WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m41s)

[struggles to have you have to pull](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m43s)

[basically a third-party Library if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m44s)

[want anything like that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m49s)

[and that's that's an something that it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m49s)

[comes with the problem I have with win](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m52s)

[ui3 is Microsoft has said that they're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m55s)

[putting out a WPF killer when they did](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m57s)

[uwp win UI and win ui2](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h45m59s)

[and I think none of those kill wpfs so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m04s)

[I'm not holding my breath on win ui3](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m07s)

[only because they've said it three times](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m09s)

[now already and I'm starting to feel](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m12s)

[like a boy who cried wolf scenario](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m14s)

[uh Mr X does point out if you want to go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m17s)

[third party rather than first party the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m19s)

[the two common options avalonia has been](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m22s)

[getting very very popular](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m26s)

[um and then Uno is the other big one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m28s)

[um and they both build on a lot of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m31s)

[newer stuff to be able to to build out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m34s)

[technically something like Unity is also](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m37s)

[an option but that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m40s)

[it's really heavily focused on Game Dev](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m42s)

[and not like line of business type](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m44s)

[applications so depending on what you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m47s)

[doing pick your favorite so gotcha but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m50s)

[if you want to go third party that that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m53s)

[is an option and avalonia did roll out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m56s)

[like some material design stuff too](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h46m59s)

[heavily based on on my library which I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m01s)

[thought was hilarious](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m03s)

[um okay which way do we want to do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m06s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m09s)

[or just a simple property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m11s)

[it feels like the property is uh like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m13s)

[it's interesting to see the messenger in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m15s)

[use unless you were you're trying to set](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m17s)

[something up with your board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m19s)

[created nope nope we can kill it we can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m21s)

[kill it at some point all at all at some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m24s)

[point I wanna at some point I think I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m26s)

[going to update so the other thing I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m28s)

[going to point out self self-promotion](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m30s)

[moment for just a second I have gotten](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m32s)

[annoyed at the amount of effort that it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m35s)

[takes me to create new projects](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m38s)

[so I have built.net templates out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m40s)

[for for actually doing all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m44s)

[like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m47s)

[so for example I've got three at the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m48s)

[moment and I'm working on a Blazer one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m51s)

[as well because I want it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m53s)

[because I wanted to be able to go.net](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m55s)

[new WPF app and be happy so I can do.net](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h47m58s)

[new kabu WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m01s)

[and I get out a WPF application that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m03s)

[basically specced out in my opinion what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m07s)

[a modern WPF app should be laid out with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m10s)

[so it's got the full genericos di setup](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m13s)

[it's got the unit testing plugged in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m16s)

[it's got the directory build props it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m17s)

[set up to use centralized package](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m20s)

[management nullable reference types are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m22s)

[enabled all the goodies](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m24s)

[are in the box and I've been thinking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m26s)

[about adding more to it because there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m29s)

[a I've been using this template now on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m31s)

[several apps and there's a few more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m33s)

[things that I find myself adding to it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m35s)

[that I keep poaching for my other apps](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m37s)

[and I'm like you know what I should just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m39s)

[put it in my template if people don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m40s)

[like it they can delete it but I've been](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m42s)

[I like this and now every time people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m45s)

[ask me how should I start my new app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m48s)

[rather than trying to give them a line](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m50s)

[of directions for setting all this stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m51s)

[up because it takes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m53s)

[I think I think it takes me like 25](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m55s)

[minutes to do which is annoying I can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m56s)

[just go.net new same for like nuget](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h48m59s)

[packages I I was annoyed when you want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m01s)

[to build a new class Library](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m03s)

[and deploy as a nuget how much of a pain](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m05s)

[in the butt it is so I built one out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m08s)

[that has all the setup that I like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m10s)

[or console apps nice same thing so okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m13s)

[Shameless self-promotion okay there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m17s)

[there there we're going with property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m20s)

[let's just make sure it works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m22s)

[and ship okay what's that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m25s)

[and you added the load games async call](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m31s)

[okay so it should like dynamically](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m34s)

[update now yep so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m36s)

[uh please update](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m38s)

[does it give you a control enter to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m44s)

[submit out of the box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m50s)

[not exactly we can do that though](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m52s)

[because that might be that might be kind](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m56s)

[of nice there's certain areas where you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h49m58s)

[get the the enter key behavior](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m00s)

[um there's a property called uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m03s)

[uh is it accepts return](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m06s)

[default key I'm trying to remember the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m09s)

[name of it but it's mostly around like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m11s)

[they Nabbit copilot stop spoiling and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m36s)

[hey you do something like that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m39s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m41s)

[so we can we can wire it up to make sure](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m43s)

[that it goes through and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m45s)

[can it do um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m47s)

[like right now that's just enter what if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m49s)

[you want to do like control enter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m51s)

[oh no it's not keys](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m57s)

[a gesture](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h50m59s)

[as you can see it's horribly complicated](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m05s)

[yeah uh Mr there thank you Mr X reminds](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m10s)

[me is default is the magical property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m13s)

[you can set on a button that will tell](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m15s)

[it that it is the default action for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m17s)

[being able to do it I I can't remember](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m19s)

[if his default Works inside of a drawer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m21s)

[host we should test](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m25s)

[so control enter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m27s)

[oh yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m29s)

[wonderful so if you want to do if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m31s)

[want to do custom things like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m33s)

[wire it up to something else](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m35s)

[that works just fine and you can you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m38s)

[obviously mix and match to your heart's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m40s)

[content for any key stroke and whatnot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m42s)

[um text box gets a little weird if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m45s)

[set this thing up for like a multi-line](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m48s)

[text box because now you have to deal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m49s)

[with what does Enter key mean if I'm in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m52s)

[a multi-line text box and like a button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m55s)

[has an is default like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m57s)

[there's some fun combinations that you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h51m59s)

[can get yourself into where you might](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m01s)

[need to tweak some properties around in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m03s)

[order to make it work but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m05s)

[for the most part it just just works I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m07s)

[like the way I think browsers handle it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m10s)

[pretty well natively like in a text area](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m12s)

[enter adds a new line but then actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m16s)

[I think they text area elements might](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m19s)

[even eat a control enter so you have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m21s)

[like tab to the next it's like a normal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m24s)

[right input and to do it and you can you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m27s)

[can get yourself into that same](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m30s)

[situation with WPF because of like order](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m31s)

[of Precedence and different things so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m34s)

[you just kind of made](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m36s)

[you have to decide what you want that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m38s)

[gesture to mean](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m40s)

[but a simple input binding is is an easy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m42s)

[way of making it go through and work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m44s)

[okay nice I'm going to propose that we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m47s)

[do a commit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m49s)

[uh how many files do we have edition of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h52m50s)

[hopefully nobody pulled in that period](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m21s)

[of time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m23s)

[it's gonna quickly scan what we did](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m30s)

[oh I probably shouldn't have included](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m33s)

[the topmost in there oh well we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m35s)

[revert it in a minute](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m37s)

[for the most part it's fine okay cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m38s)

[so we could go through and see about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h53m58s)

[slapping in some sort of like styling on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m00s)

[these guys here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m03s)

[to make them be a little more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m05s)

[interesting and not you know as ugly as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m07s)

[what we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m11s)

[can you add a new rental oh oh we didn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m24s)

[hook it up two actual games we do not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m27s)

[actually have that we could go we could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m29s)

[go plug that in we now have a games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m30s)

[catalog](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m32s)

[yeah I guess it's it's probably worth](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m33s)

[getting the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m36s)

[current screens all wired up to each](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m39s)

[other](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m41s)

[before moving on to something too crazy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m42s)

[so you're proposing adding the list of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m44s)

[games in here right is that the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m47s)

[oh so you did like a modal here no I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m50s)

[didn't it's actually just a card oh it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m53s)

[just uh oh with margin yeah it's just a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m55s)

[card with a margin sitting around it and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h54m58s)

[like in retrospect I probably should](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m00s)

[consider something similar on all of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m02s)

[them because it is a difference in UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m04s)

[between each of them yeah but I was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m06s)

[having fun and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m09s)

[enjoying can you do like uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m11s)

[template inheritance type stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m15s)

[with your xaml files](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m18s)

[uh uh to some degree yes you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m20s)

[definitely do composition](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m23s)

[of pulling things together and you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m25s)

[do re-usive templates wherever you would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m27s)

[like there's not templates themselves](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m30s)

[don't have an inheritance hierarchy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m33s)

[though](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m35s)

[styling does like sort of like how CSS](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m37s)

[you can kind of group things together](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m40s)

[um but in xaml we have a single](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m43s)

[inheritor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m46s)

[so we can't do like polyglot things of I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m47s)

[want to base my new style on Styles A](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m50s)

[and B it's like no no you got to kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m52s)

[put those in in a list going straight](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m54s)

[down there's not a there's not a way to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m57s)

[mix and match them so okay interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h55m59s)

[kind of like the these things here is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m02s)

[I've got a style it's targeting a text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m04s)

[block](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m06s)

[um or I should say it's based on the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m08s)

[previous text block style so you can get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m11s)

[these things where it's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m13s)

[you can you can only be based on one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m15s)

[thing at a time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m18s)

[um but you wanted to go here right and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m21s)

[do and do the list of games in this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m23s)

[so we actually had this in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m27s)

[as as a side note I'm I'm curious I was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m29s)

[just thinking about it uh when we were](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m32s)

[looking at some DB context stuff did you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h56m34s)

[I don't know if I I think this came](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m13s)

[through at a point where I was busy and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m15s)

[I never actually dug into it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m17s)

[yeah I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m20s)

[I think Andrew](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m24s)

[he pointed out that it was a uh most of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m26s)

[what this article talked about was was](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m29s)

[not necessarily orm problems but more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m31s)

[like problems with bad orms](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h57m34s)

[button down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m14s)

[to row three this is one of the things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m15s)

[some some tooling will do like when you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m17s)

[um what type of interface for picking a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m33s)

[list of games because this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m36s)

[theoretically multi-selection we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m37s)

[like a list with check boxes or I so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m39s)

[I built this stupid custom component](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m46s)

[that was like a it was like for uh uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m48s)

[select like a multi-select and instead](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m52s)

[of being able to type in to search to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m54s)

[like filter it down easily you have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m56s)

[like vertic or horizontally scroll and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h58m59s)

[like Click on each thing that you want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m02s)

[to toggle on and the more I use it the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m04s)

[more I hate it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m07s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m09s)

[so I wouldn't recommend oh you wouldn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m12s)

[recommend a horizontal scroll to go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m14s)

[through but I agree with you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m15s)

[um let's see they there are some is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m19s)

[material offer](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m21s)

[uh so there's various things so they've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m23s)

[got styling for like your regular check](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m26s)

[box we do have toggles we do have we do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m30s)

[have these Maneuvers here where we can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m33s)

[go me like we got toggles we got yeah we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m35s)

[got those types of toggles we've got](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m38s)

[like lists](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m41s)

[of things](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m43s)

[like because we can we can combine the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m46s)

[toggles into here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m48s)

[can we do something like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m50s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m56s)

[on teams](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=01h59m57s)

[thanks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m12s)

[um I send you a screenshot on teams to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m14s)

[Andrew's cat Gallery oh that's terrified](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m17s)

[but it's got this like a tags](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m21s)

[multi-select thing you're going to make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m23s)

[this hard for me okay so you wanna you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m26s)

[wanna combo box drop down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m28s)

[with check boxes on a multi-list thingy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m31s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m35s)

[for reference is this in the Box no can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m37s)

[we go and slap this together really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m41s)

[quick yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m43s)

[okay we're gonna have to piece together](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m45s)

[some pieces so I think what we're gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m47s)

[do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m49s)

[I think the easy because people have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m50s)

[asked for this multiple times the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m52s)

[biggest issue I have is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m54s)

[I don't like the idea of styling out a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m57s)

[combo box and I probably should right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h00m59s)

[because this is what what people are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m02s)

[expecting is they want this this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m04s)

[Behavior the problem is is the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m06s)

[behavior in WPF is built around single](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m09s)

[item selection which is why I go you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m11s)

[want something that looks like a combo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m14s)

[box but you don't actually want the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m16s)

[behavior of a combo box and in WPF could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m18s)

[the the look of a control and the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m21s)

[behavior of the control are separate so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m24s)

[if all you want is a control to look a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m26s)

[different way trivial that Mark that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m27s)

[much they made easy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m30s)

[but because the behavior here is so much](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m32s)

[focused on single item selection I don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m34s)

[think it's what we want and I think what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m37s)

[we would what we want instead](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m39s)

[is what a is one of these guys here is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m42s)

[we want something like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m45s)

[that's a pop-up box where the button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m47s)

[looks like a combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m50s)

[but when you click on it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m52s)

[it opens up one of these and obviously](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m54s)

[this has stuff on the left but we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m56s)

[check boxes over there and then they'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h01m59s)

[say so I think that's ideally type in in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m01s)

[the input filters your your elements in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m04s)

[your list see now you're immediately](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m07s)

[making this hard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m09s)

[because how do you do typing in your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m11s)

[input](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m14s)

[oh hang on hang on Alternate proposal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m15s)

[then alternate proposal what if rather](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m17s)

[that what if we did go with a regular](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m20s)

[Cobble box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m21s)

[combo box where did they go right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m24s)

[because regular combo boxes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m27s)

[um have this like how you have this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m30s)

[search right because you want to be able](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m32s)

[to do like Apple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m33s)

[right yeah and have it get picked what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m35s)

[if we do a combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m38s)

[that way we can get this kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m40s)

[behavior but when an item is selected we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m42s)

[clear it from the combo box and then we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m45s)

[add in a where's the the little picker](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m48s)

[thingama uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m51s)

[because we've got the little chips](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m53s)

[[ __ ] it's under chips](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m56s)

[so you put those in the combo box we put](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h02m59s)

[we don't necessarily put those in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m02s)

[combo box but I'm wondering about](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m03s)

[putting a row of those Above So as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m04s)

[things are selected in the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m07s)

[these things show up in a list and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m08s)

[maybe we let the user like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m11s)

[close them out if they want right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m13s)

[because like there's the delete](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m15s)

[I'm wondering if maybe something like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m17s)

[that works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m22s)

[yeah I'm down for it I'm trying to see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m23s)

[if I can find a better like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m25s)

[something like this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m29s)

[uh here we go so here's another example](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m32s)

[of the good old](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m37s)

[select two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m40s)

[select two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m43s)

[okay so let's see this one doesn't show](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m46s)

[the inputs but you as you type you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m48s)

[use arrows to like select stuff and it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m51s)

[sort of using like a chip ish thing but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m52s)

[you can also like delete them by doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m55s)

[backspace](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m57s)

[ah um let me see if there's a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h03m59s)

[multi-select pill box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m03s)

[multi select](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m05s)

[oh okay so angular's material components](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m08s)

[don't seem to let you type you can only](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m11s)

[you could only pick and that doesn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m13s)

[surprise me the ability to type and have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m15s)

[this kind of behavior](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m18s)

[because this is definitely not something](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m22s)

[that's in the box but I but I like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m24s)

[because I I do like this idea of giving](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m27s)

[the combo box for the selection but then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m29s)

[doing the the chips or the pills for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m32s)

[for showing them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m36s)

[I think that works well there's not one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m37s)

[in here is there I don't think so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m40s)

[think the chip is the closest one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m42s)

[and the chip says what the uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m46s)

[what that cat gallery does if you select](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m50s)

[some so actually you have access to this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m53s)

[let me just send you the link](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h04m55s)

[so I'm looking to see if there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m00s)

[because people have asked for various](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m04s)

[controls to be added for the material](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m05s)

[design library to do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m07s)

[yeah I I feel like I used it at one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m09s)

[point so I thought they were it was more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m12s)

[common than it was but it actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m14s)

[doesn't seem super common to have both](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m16s)

[the like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m19s)

[check box or like kind of toggles with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m20s)

[the chips as well as like the textual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m24s)

[input yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m25s)

[well the other thing that I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m28s)

[about is these types of inputs seem](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m29s)

[really focused on the idea of a small](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m32s)

[number of selections right like if I had](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m35s)

[an input like this and I wanted to put](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m39s)

[in a dozen items](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m41s)

[as soon as the width as soon as these](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m43s)

[items fill up the width I feel like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m45s)

[that's mildly problematic for me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m47s)

[and I'm not sure I like that anymore](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m49s)

[yeah it seems like it's really good for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m51s)

[a small if you only expect a small](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m54s)

[number of selections and I think in at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m55s)

[least in my use case here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h05m58s)

[loading out board games it's fairly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m00s)

[common for somebody to borrow half a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m02s)

[dozen](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m04s)

[yeah it does so this one like starts to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m05s)

[Vertical wrap and looks a little meh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m08s)

[yeah but I do so okay so let's let's go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m11s)

[down this route though because I kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m15s)

[like the idea of having the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m16s)

[plus the the list of chips](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m19s)

[so we could slap that together that that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m22s)

[will that that we can do right I like it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m25s)

[so item Source binding okay so actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m27s)

[before we get too carried away maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m31s)

[let's build this out for the view model](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m33s)

[side first so add rental view model so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m35s)

[we're going to need a couple things uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m37s)

[first thing we need we need a public](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m39s)

[observable collection of board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m50s)

[uh games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m51s)

[do the needful](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m53s)

[it's going to look real similar here in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m55s)

[a minute uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m57s)

[uh binding operations enable collection](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h06m59s)

[synchronization](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m02s)

[board games new okay perfect got that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m04s)

[let's see another suggestion is maybe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m10s)

[two lists boxes with a move Left Right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m12s)

[makes sense here too](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m14s)

[um I could see something like that of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m16s)

[you know pick the ones](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m19s)

[can you put images in uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m20s)

[oh yes oh yes Twitter or not the Twitter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m23s)

[the twitch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m26s)

[uh we so the beautiful thing about WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m28s)

[is most of our things are content](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m32s)

[controls which means we can embed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m35s)

[arbitrary content citable it's my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m36s)

[favorite thing when winforms developers](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m39s)

[start mocking WPF is I tell them to put](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m41s)

[an image inside their button with some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m43s)

[text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m45s)

[and then watch it and then watch them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m46s)

[struggle it's great because for for us](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m48s)

[we do a stack panel an image and a text](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m50s)

[block we're done it's like have fun](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m52s)

[so yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m56s)

[um but let's start here because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h07m59s)

[regardless of what we do we need this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m01s)

[um we're going to need some sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m04s)

[observable property and this is where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m06s)

[uh let's see private board game let's do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m10s)

[selected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m15s)

[board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m16s)

[I kind of want to build it this way just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m18s)

[just to show how to do it and then we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m19s)

[want a public observable collection](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m22s)

[board game I don't know selected games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m26s)

[right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m30s)

[this is the most beautiful thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m31s)

[selected Games boom okay so we got that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m37s)

[we got that we got that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m41s)

[we're gonna need to load these thingies](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m43s)

[up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m45s)

[I'm gonna just straight up steal some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m47s)

[code here real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m49s)

[because it's not plagiarism if you steal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m52s)

[from yourself](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m54s)

[um let's see what did I call it oh this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h08m57s)

[one's called DB context](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m00s)

[uh and then we want uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m03s)

[or games clear](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m07s)

[or games and this is just going to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m11s)

[straight up ad of the DB object](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m13s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m18s)

[we're going to do a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m20s)

[do a little loaded thing here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m23s)

[hang on come on autocomplete there you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m29s)

[go boom okay copilot here's your chance](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m32s)

[be awesome](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m35s)

[copilot you are not impressing me there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m41s)

[we are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m45s)

[no you fail](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m48s)

[that was too much to hold for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m50s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m52s)

[uh I wanted you to impress me co-pilot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m55s)

[you did not impress me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h09m57s)

[I mean I left you an app with multiple](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m00s)

[examples in it I wanted it to figure it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m02s)

[out okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m04s)

[okay so that guy launches that guy loads](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m05s)

[does not need a task return](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m07s)

[ah great question uh it can't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m09s)

[so async void in most c-sharp is bad bad](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m14s)

[bad bad bad bad](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m18s)

[um however there is one case where AC](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m20s)

[void is acceptable and it is top level](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m22s)

[event handlers so this is an event](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m25s)

[handler an event Handler's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m28s)

[um have to have or depending on the the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m31s)

[delegate type of the event in this case](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m35s)

[routed event handler routed event](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m37s)

[handler has a return type of void so you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m39s)

[can't make it task returning so this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m42s)

[the one case where async void is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m45s)

[allowed and the reason why async void](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m49s)

[was added as a feature](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h10m51s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m00s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m04s)

[it's it's a lot of more modern](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m05s)

[Frameworks don't necessarily USE events](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m07s)

[because an event is just basically a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m10s)

[list of delegates to be invoked](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m12s)

[um and the problem being is most of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m15s)

[time people want to start getting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m17s)

[fancier with order of operations](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m18s)

[because you don't necessarily control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m21s)

[the order of the list you do plus equals](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m23s)

[which says](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m26s)

[add item to list you do minus equals](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m27s)

[which says remove item from list if it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m30s)

[exists](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m32s)

[but you don't really control the order](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m33s)

[like you can go get the delegate list to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m35s)

[do some magic yourself if you want but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m37s)

[it's it's a little more unusual more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m38s)

[modern things favor more directed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m41s)

[vocation rather than the indirectness of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m44s)

[events](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m46s)

[or is that loaded is that loaded thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m47s)

[coming from like a global using no so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m49s)

[this is coming from the Base Class of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m52s)

[rental view so it's not obvious because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m54s)

[I've deleted the Base Class definition](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m57s)

[but the Base Class of AD rental view is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h11m59s)

[user control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m03s)

[so if we if we chase down the the UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m04s)

[hierarchy all the way down I believe it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m08s)

[loaded exists up framework element if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m10s)

[I'm not mistaken](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m12s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m14s)

[so that's where it exists oh I see so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m18s)

[it's like four levels deep in our](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m21s)

[hierarchy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m22s)

[but it is there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m24s)

[um okay so that will go there that will](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m26s)

[load](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m28s)

[now we'll put everything in place okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m29s)

[now combo box time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m31s)

[uh let's see combo box grid row and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m34s)

[we'll put the chips above it I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m38s)

[yeah that way the drop down doesn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m40s)

[cover above](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m42s)

[I think that makes sense so you're going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m44s)

[to go in Grid row two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m46s)

[uh you're gonna have an item Source we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m48s)

[are going to bind you to the board games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m49s)

[we're going to do a display member path](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m52s)

[of name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m55s)

[and we are going to do a selected item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h12m56s)

[we'll be bound to selected board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m00s)

[done okay so there's the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m03s)

[two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m07s)

[when people say wpf's hard it's easy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m09s)

[uh let's see I kind of like the outline](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m14s)

[Style](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m16s)

[what do you think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m18s)

[oh do we want to go with a filled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m19s)

[approach one again I I think outline](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m21s)

[looks better for a combo box I agree](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m23s)

[with you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m26s)

[let's grab his style](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m27s)

[be Purdy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m31s)

[okay so you go there you go there that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m34s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m37s)

[um why is my button moved up so much](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m39s)

[grid row zero one oh because I added two](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m42s)

[and I only incremented that once okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m46s)

[uh there is a fun thing on grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m49s)

[go grid lines true this makes your grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m52s)

[look](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m55s)

[uglier than all get out but it shows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m56s)

[blue and yellow dashed lines on where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h13m58s)

[your rows and columns are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m00s)

[for debugging should never be used](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m02s)

[outside of debug oh that's not one of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m05s)

[those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m07s)

[uh like this design time once uh well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m08s)

[well so it so show grid lines](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m11s)

[true right this is now applying to your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m15s)

[real app but if I were to do D colon](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m17s)

[now it's only design time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m20s)

[so you can put anything after d colon](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m23s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m27s)

[and make it a design time only property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m28s)

[so if you only want to see grid lines in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m30s)

[design time that's an option](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m32s)

[that's one of those features that I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m36s)

[don't feel like gets enough love](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m37s)

[or enough attention it's rather clever](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m39s)

[okay so uh next thing we need to do is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m42s)

[when the uh not you go away](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m46s)

[when this guy gets a value we want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m50s)

[actually pop him into into the selected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m54s)

[games so remember how I showed you how](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m57s)

[there were all of those partial methods](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h14m59s)

[that the source generator did for us](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m01s)

[so on selected board game changed and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m04s)

[think we only care about the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m07s)

[new value](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m10s)

[so we'll just do this one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m12s)

[all right so when the value change](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m13s)

[selected games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m15s)

[dot add](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m17s)

[value](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m19s)

[we should probably note check it to you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m21s)

[so if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m22s)

[value is not null](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m24s)

[then we'll add it because I don't really](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m28s)

[want to add null when we clear it right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m29s)

[and then I think what we'll do is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m31s)

[selected uh board game gets no so this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m34s)

[is one of those things that you should](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m39s)

[be careful with this is how you cause](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m40s)

[stack overflows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m42s)

[yeah it's calling back on yourself](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m44s)

[repeatedly however the nice part with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m47s)

[property changes is the built-in thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m50s)

[the first thing that that thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m53s)

[generates is an if check of is the new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m54s)

[value different than the old value if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m56s)

[the answer is no it stops](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h15m58s)

[thank goodness so you don't just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m00s)

[yeah because that so we'll do this we'll](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m03s)

[add it in we'll know that out and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m07s)

[what we need we need to remove it if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m08s)

[it's null from the list oh from here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m11s)

[front yeah from there or good question](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m15s)

[let's try it without and then let's come](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m18s)

[back because we it probably would make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m21s)

[most sense to because it doesn't make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m23s)

[sense to let somebody pick the same game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m25s)

[multiple times](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m26s)

[and we might want a distinct list or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m28s)

[similar so we're going to do an items](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m31s)

[control again so uh an items control in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m33s)

[WPF is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m37s)

[uh no not selected board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m39s)

[um an item's control is sort of the most](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m44s)

[basic of Selections in WPF it it allows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m47s)

[you to basically just uh repeat over a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m53s)

[set and apply a template to them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h16m57s)

[which is great it but there are a lot of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m01s)

[controls that derive from items control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m04s)

[like list view list box data grid all of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m06s)

[those things are similar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m09s)

[um but sometimes we just want the low](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m11s)

[level stuff the big disadvantage of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m13s)

[items control is it doesn't have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m15s)

[built-in selection or scrolling if you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m17s)

[want that you have to add it it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m19s)

[literally just the repeat but in this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m21s)

[case I think that I think that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m23s)

[actually to our advantage](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m24s)

[um and then I want to go grab that chip](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m27s)

[so I think I want this one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m31s)

[yeah sure you probably aren't going to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m34s)

[use the icon bit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m36s)

[uh oh so hang on data template data](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m38s)

[data type uh board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m43s)

[that is not the right data type but I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m47s)

[just want to paste it real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m49s)

[so this is going to be X type and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m51s)

[don't think we've actually included the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m54s)

[namespace for our data directory yet](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h17m55s)

[I don't see it so XML and S](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m00s)

[data gets CLR](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m05s)

[I might well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m12s)

[that one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m17s)

[yeah it is CLR namespace](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m19s)

[why are you why are you being mean to me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m23s)

[okay so this is data colon or game and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m25s)

[now it's happening okay so that's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m29s)

[changing your context for that item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m31s)

[correct yeah and we may want to put an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m33s)

[icon in at some point but we don't have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m36s)

[an icon right now so we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m38s)

[drop that we don't have a tool tip uh is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m40s)

[deletable we'll leave it to be true](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m46s)

[uh we'll leave that for now I don't want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m49s)

[to delete click we want this to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m51s)

[binding on the name of the game and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m53s)

[we don't need to click on that either so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h18m57s)

[we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m00s)

[and now it just works like a chart](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m01s)

[oh wait we did do it we did it hang up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m05s)

[we got to change one thing we gotta](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m08s)

[change one thing so the only other thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m09s)

[I didn't like is the items control it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m11s)

[the the layout that it's doing I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m14s)

[we want it to go horizontally](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m18s)

[not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m19s)

[vertically so if we do we change its](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m21s)

[items panel up and we do a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m24s)

[uh items panel template and we do a wrap](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m27s)

[panel](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m31s)

[boom there that's better](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m31s)

[so around that wrap to the next line](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m34s)

[when it hits its maximum width yep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m37s)

[sure okay so come here come here new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m40s)

[rental loan to Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m43s)

[and Joe would like to borrow Foo oh uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m46s)

[right we put that in the wrong grid rows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m51s)

[so hang on hang on we can fix this we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m52s)

[can fix this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m57s)

[grid row](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h19m59s)

[one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m02s)

[boom okay so you now it didn't clear](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m03s)

[that out which is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m06s)

[a little annoying to me that that didn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m09s)

[propagate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m12s)

[didn't we clear it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m17s)

[I want to make sure that we're actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m21s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m22s)

[show so selected board game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m24s)

[the operation is not legal in its](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m31s)

[current state](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m34s)

[what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m36s)

[I am confused what was not legal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m40s)

[it seemed like something on top of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m43s)

[reload was yeah it was like my cursor](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m45s)

[it didn't okay so if I go Joe](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m49s)

[step](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m56s)

[wow edits were made which cannot be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h20m58s)

[compiled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m01s)

[if you disable hot ruler does it work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m04s)

[so that's there I wonder if it's the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m13s)

[live share messing with the debugger](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m15s)

[so that cleared that out I'm a little I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m19s)

[I so we're gonna we're gonna Snoop this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m22s)

[guy real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m24s)

[here I'll leave the live shark so that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m25s)

[we're on these actually it looks like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m28s)

[I don't even know if I'm so you are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m31s)

[still in it I see you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m33s)

[um okay so I want to look at this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m35s)

[uh tooth okay so I want to take a quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m39s)

[Gander at this combo box let's see combo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m42s)

[box we're going to look here and I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m46s)

[to look at his](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m47s)

[uh selected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m49s)

[item so his selected item is nulled out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m52s)

[but he still has](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m55s)

[that oh is this what I need to know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h21m58s)

[about to clear uh okay hang on I got you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m01s)

[I got you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m05s)

[selected value boom I think that works](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m08s)

[interesting what's the difference there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m11s)

[so the difference being the there are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m13s)

[multiple ways to display a list of items](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m17s)

[in a combo box I'm gonna make sure this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m21s)

[works nope that didn't work out either](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m24s)

[why did you not do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m30s)

[the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m32s)

[typically selected item because you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m35s)

[set display member path and then you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m39s)

[do selected value path because sometimes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m42s)

[you want your selected value to not be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m43s)

[the whole object itself but a property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m45s)

[on your object which generally selected](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m48s)

[value will then end up being the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m51s)

[the the value not the whole item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m53s)

[in this case because we haven't set that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m57s)

[up selected item and selected value I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h22m59s)

[would expect to end up being equal](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m01s)

[um but clearly that is not happening](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m05s)

[and I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m13s)

[interested so those things are just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m15s)

[sorry I don't remember the order under](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m23s)

[which this does it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m26s)

[oh so that triggered twice oh so it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m28s)

[going through multiple times](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m31s)

[that's annoying I think I think what's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m34s)

[biting us is that recursive nature of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m37s)

[what we've set](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m39s)

[because it's setting it to null yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m41s)

[yeah I think that's what's biting us so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m44s)

[let's go back to there and I think all](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m46s)

[we need to do is just set it back to no](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m49s)

[after the update occurs so we just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m53s)

[basically need to queue it up to occur](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m55s)

[later](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h23m57s)

[um and we can do that fairly easily do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m00s)

[we have a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m03s)

[we do okay I normally don't like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m04s)

[bringing dispatcher in directly but in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m08s)

[the interest of Simplicity and time](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m10s)

[we're just going to bring in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m12s)

[dispatcher directly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m13s)

[because he's already registered in the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m21s)

[in the DI container normally I would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m24s)

[wrap this guy and slap him behind an](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m26s)

[interface because this is very much a UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m28s)

[object that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m30s)

[really has no place of Landing in here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m32s)

[but inside of here if we do dispatcher](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m34s)

[uh begin invoke](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m37s)

[oh so this like kind of cues it up for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m40s)

[like the next](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m42s)

[cycle correct](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m44s)

[specifically on the UI thread so this CH](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m48s)

[this property change because it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m52s)

[occurring from a combo box selection is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m53s)

[coming in on the UI thread this will](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m55s)

[then kick it to be the next pass around](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m57s)

[and I think that will probably handle it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h24m59s)

[is I'm willing to bet the combo box is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m01s)

[the the order of operations problem of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m04s)

[it's making a change and the change is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m07s)

[coming back through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m09s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m11s)

[well this is an uneditable combo box we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m14s)

[need to make you editable so I can type](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m16s)

[uh combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m18s)

[is editable true okay so I want to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m21s)

[able to type in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m25s)

[oh that's actually somewhat problematic](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m28s)

[because as soon as it matches it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m31s)

[immediately selecting the item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m33s)

[oh that's that's an interesting problem](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m36s)

[so we might want to do selected item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m39s)

[I wasn't matching because it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m44s)

[because there's only for example well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m46s)

[there's only one one thing that starts](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m49s)

[with f so if I type in F](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m50s)

[it's immediately matching Foo and adding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m55s)

[and that becomes the selected item and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h25m57s)

[then it's immediately going all the way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m00s)

[in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m01s)

[uh I see so it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m02s)

[um like the autocomplete is selecting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m06s)

[that first scratches](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m10s)

[uh oh I want update Source trigger and I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m14s)

[think I want to do this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m18s)

[and now it's not setting it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m23s)

[until I explicitly Tab out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m26s)

[that's better for that purpose but it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m29s)

[would be nice if I didn't have to have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m33s)

[it lose focus I wanted to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m36s)

[an auto I wanted to basically commit on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m38s)

[enter of selection right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m41s)

[like you when you press enter or click](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m46s)

[on one of the combo box items yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m48s)

[because the question is is when is the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m50s)

[user done right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m52s)

[is if I type in j-o-e am I done here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h26m55s)

[if I hit space am I done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m00s)

[because I have a feeling what we're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m02s)

[going to end up needing to do is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m04s)

[actually wire is actually watch the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m06s)

[relevant events when we want the user to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m09s)

[be done](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m10s)

[because we don't actually get notified](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m12s)

[of item click inside the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m14s)

[one thing that I've seen before](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m18s)

[is like as your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m23s)

[typing in this sort of input as you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m26s)

[press space it sort of converts the last](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m28s)

[word from just text into like a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m31s)

[chip and it'll render in the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m34s)

[or whatever element right so you can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m37s)

[hear space should actually trigger it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m39s)

[assuming this is a fully completed thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m42s)

[yeah I guess if you had sort of you know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m45s)

[basically two-way binding then as you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m47s)

[typing in that combo box and you're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m49s)

[adding spaces it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m51s)

[adding oh man this seems like a tricky](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m54s)

[yeah well it's like this thing can get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m56s)

[complex well and it could but I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h27m59s)

[wondering if something like in our case](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m01s)

[the the like if we had food and food too](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m04s)

[as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m06s)

[a game names right that's that's not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m08s)

[likely to occur](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m11s)

[like you're gonna have to disambiguate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m15s)

[at some point](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m17s)

[I'm just not sure where the right point](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m19s)

[is I'm somewhat tempted to have to just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m21s)

[wire up on the enter key](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m24s)

[and when the enter key is hit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m26s)

[commit it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m29s)

[or if you click on something but you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m32s)

[said you don't have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m35s)

[you can't hook into that yeah well I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m37s)

[don't well let me confirm I'm so the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m40s)

[hard part is the pop-up for a combo or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m42s)

[the the drop down for a combo box is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m45s)

[displayed in a pop-up and that shows up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m47s)

[in a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m49s)

[separate window so if we click here if I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m51s)

[click Foo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m54s)

[the combobox item handles it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h28m57s)

[we could grab this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m02s)

[so the nice part so in WPF events have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m05s)

[what are called uh tunneling and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m09s)

[bubbling so when you actually do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m11s)

[something in Windows like click that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m13s)

[event starts at your top level window](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m15s)

[and tunnels down through your xaml until](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m17s)

[it finds the element that it hits and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m20s)

[then it bubbles back up through your](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m22s)

[xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m24s)

[indicating what it was so the preview](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m25s)

[Mouse down is your tunneling one where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m27s)

[it started at the top level window and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m29s)

[then worked its way all the way down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m31s)

[until it got to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m33s)

[um the combo box item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m36s)

[and then it bubbled back up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m38s)

[all the way from the combo box I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m41s)

[uh item back up through the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m44s)

[um stack or I guess technically it went](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m48s)

[all the way down to the text block](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m50s)

[inside then bubbled up the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m51s)

[item marked it as handled but it does](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m54s)

[bubble all the way up through this like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h29m57s)

[it continues bubbling even after it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m01s)

[handled correct the the thing is is if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m03s)

[all you do is register for like say](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m05s)

[mouse down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m07s)

[it doesn't uh you won't see the event](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m10s)

[now there's a special registration you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m13s)

[can go and do where we could register up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m16s)

[on the combo box and say give me all of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m18s)

[the mouse click events even if they're](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m21s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m22s)

[and I don't think there's a special](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m24s)

[combo box one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m25s)

[yeah I don't let me check I don't think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m28s)

[combo box has anything specific to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m31s)

[itself to indicate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m33s)

[that it was handled I mean to some](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m37s)

[degree though we could we could watch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m40s)

[the the click event and say](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m42s)

[if this was handled by a combo box item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m45s)

[inside of the combo box we know what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m49s)

[what was clicked on but I don't think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m51s)

[there's an actual because it knows when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m54s)

[it's opened it knows when it's closed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m55s)

[the other thing is you almost want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h30m58s)

[pop the drop down as the user's typing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m00s)

[right like the default behavior of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m02s)

[combo box doesn't show it expanded and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m04s)

[you almost wanted expanded anytime the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m07s)

[focus is inside of here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m10s)

[yeah because it's you can't just type in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m13s)

[any old string it has to be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m16s)

[one of the specific values well let's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m20s)

[let's turn that on real quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m24s)

[so you can do that that part's easy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m26s)

[relative Source uh self and then I want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m29s)

[to bind on is drop down uh no not his](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m33s)

[drop down is keyboard Focus Within](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m37s)

[so now if the keyboard focuses inside of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m41s)

[here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m44s)

[we're going to restart because I don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m47s)

[think it's able to pick that up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m48s)

[keyboard focus is inside of here the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m50s)

[drop down is open should follow that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m52s)

[uh uh let's see a two-way to one-way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m56s)

[suit uh oh this one's a two-way binding](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h31m59s)

[now we ain't two-way binding the sucker](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m06s)

[mode](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m07s)

[one way](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m10s)

[because it's saying when the drop down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m14s)

[closes it wants to set that value back](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m16s)

[into is keyboard focused within it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m18s)

[like no no oh I see so that is drop down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m20s)

[open is by default two-way yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m23s)

[because is drop down open is a user](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m26s)

[interactable property right the user can](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m29s)

[interact to toggle that property](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m31s)

[therefore it defaults into it but now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m33s)

[does it give you arrows](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m35s)

[here like the drop down here uh like on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m38s)

[the keyboard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m41s)

[did I do this yeah okay cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m43s)

[yeah so I could go through here and then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m47s)

[I could hit enter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m49s)

[and that closes it and sort of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m50s)

[right and right now because I've set it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m54s)

[as](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m56s)

[on Lost Focus](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h32m59s)

[but I am wondering if maybe what we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m01s)

[to do is handle the click](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m03s)

[and handle like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m05s)

[uh oh how am I inside of here and not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m07s)

[have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m10s)

[oh interesting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m12s)

[um I was able to get with the click I'm](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m15s)

[able to now get inside of here the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m18s)

[pop-up closes and the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m20s)

[the binding's not re-triggering because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m24s)

[it doesn't know that it needs to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m27s)

[which binding the the is drop down open](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m32s)

[oh I see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m36s)

[like and this might just be one of those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m38s)

[cases where we have to set this guy up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m40s)

[so that we watch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m42s)

[clicks and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m45s)

[enter](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m47s)

[to be able to do what we need](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m49s)

[that's probably not that bad let's just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m53s)

[do that really quick](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m55s)

[because we can we can do that very](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m57s)

[easily](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h33m59s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m00s)

[oh we can't do it here we have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m02s)

[because I just finished telling you you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m04s)

[can't do a normal registration](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m06s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m09s)

[um I need to give that combo box a name](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m12s)

[so I can reference it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m15s)

[uh game](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m17s)

[drop down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m21s)

[game drop down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m24s)

[what is it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m30s)

[add Handler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m32s)

[and then we need to tell it the routed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m36s)

[event this is going to be Mouse down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m38s)

[event](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m41s)

[uh let's see on Mouse down handled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m44s)

[events to true](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m49s)

[so you specifically have to do that and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m51s)

[then we have to create ourselves a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m53s)

[routed event handler so private deployed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m55s)

[on Mouse down and you have to go and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h34m58s)

[then memorize the signature of what this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m02s)

[event is so this is a routed event so I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m05s)

[just know that it's going to be a routed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m08s)

[event handler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m10s)

[which](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m11s)

[we should go here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m14s)

[uh actually where's the easiest way if](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m16s)

[we just do routed event handler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m18s)

[you can then](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m21s)

[F12 on it that's your signature](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m23s)

[void return](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m27s)

[on Mouse down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m29s)

[okay so if e Dot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m32s)

[uh handled equals true](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m35s)

[and E Dot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m39s)

[let's see uh I think trying to remember](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m42s)

[which one comes through](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m45s)

[I think it's source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m49s)

[Source will be the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m53s)

[yeah we I don't know if we're gonna see](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h35m59s)

[the handle Buy in here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m01s)

[let's just let's just catch it see what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m04s)

[happens why is it is that just an old uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m07s)

[warning uh well I guess not that on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m13s)

[Mouse down on 14. oh uh new routed event](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m17s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m23s)

[because it doesn't the the signature on](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m24s)

[ad Handler wants a delegate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m27s)

[and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m29s)

[uh people often forget when registering](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m31s)

[events like I just did](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m34s)

[that you actually have to instantiate a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m36s)

[delegate instance the problem is is the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m39s)

[compiler team has done too much work to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m41s)

[make that hidden from you and behind the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m43s)

[scenes in most cases where you don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m46s)

[have to think about it and so people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m47s)

[forget that it's actually a thing that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m49s)

[you're supposed to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m51s)

[okay so I want to do this with keyboard](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m52s)

[so I don't trigger this now if I click](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m55s)

[here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h36m58s)

[okay so what do I get inside of this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m00s)

[one of you I want to be the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m02s)

[I guess we could get much](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m06s)

[better if we cast the event args we get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m08s)

[more information](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m12s)

[uh let's see suppressed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m14s)

[original sources the grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m16s)

[source is the combo box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m19s)

[we don't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m22s)

[is that what you were looking for the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m24s)

[combo box or no I was kind of hoping to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m26s)

[know that they clicked on an item and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m28s)

[what the item was itself and we could we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m31s)

[could walk up the tree and find it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m34s)

[and this is where it might get ugly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m39s)

[wouldn't it be going down the tree well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m45s)

[so original Source I believe will be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m49s)

[coming from uh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m51s)

[uh oh actually original source is huge](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m54s)

[no actual height 31. so this grid I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h37m57s)

[believe is the grid of the that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m01s)

[holding the content inside of the combo](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m05s)

[box item](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m06s)

[because this original source is only 31](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m08s)

[pixels tall](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m11s)

[oh device independent pixels but yes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m17s)

[so this is the one that was actually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m18s)

[that like that actually triggered the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m21s)

[mouse down event the one that started](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m23s)

[the whole bubbling event back up now](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m25s)

[walking goes through row](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m28s)

[correct](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m31s)

[yes because if I let this breakpoint go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m33s)

[and we go and Snoop this thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m36s)

[if we go and look at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m40s)

[oh stop it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m43s)

[why are you not wanting to stay open](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m46s)

[anymore](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m48s)

[uh if I look here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m52s)

[um you'll see this here I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m55s)

[bet it's this grid right here or this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h38m58s)

[grid wrapper so one of these two going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m00s)

[up my hierarchy is likely the original](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m03s)

[one when I click on it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m06s)

[and if we look at the event on here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m11s)

[Mouse down](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m13s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m16s)

[grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m20s)

[I'm surprised I would have expected to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m25s)

[be one of the individual grids the fact](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m28s)

[that it showed that it didn't show a oh](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m29s)

[I wonder if it's because before I didn't](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m32s)

[click I clicked like here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m34s)

[and I missed there that's probably what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m37s)

[it was if you click on the text portion](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m40s)

[of it the text block itself will be the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m42s)

[original Source but if you click and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m45s)

[don't hit the text you end up hitting](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m47s)

[the grid behind it which is this grid](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m49s)

[here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m52s)

[so either way can you work up from those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m53s)

[elements to your we could work up to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h39m56s)

[combo box item from them](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m00s)

[right so if original source is here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m09s)

[so there's a thing called the visual](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m09s)

[tree helper](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m11s)

[get parent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m13s)

[and then you do e dot original source](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m16s)

[right and then you end up we we have to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m20s)

[slap this guy in a loop basically to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m23s)

[start walking up the tree to stop either](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m25s)

[when he returns no because get parent](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m28s)

[returns null once you get to the top at](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m29s)

[like your window](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m31s)

[um or if we've hit a combo box item or](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m33s)

[our combo box which the fact that this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m37s)

[is coming from a mouse event that we](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m38s)

[know is bubbling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m41s)

[we should hit ourselves before we hit](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m43s)

[the top of the window](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m45s)

[otherwise I question how this router](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m46s)

[event got triggered](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m48s)

[so that would be one option I'm just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m51s)

[wondering if it makes sense to keep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m53s)

[trying to beat the combo box into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m55s)

[submission versus roll our own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m56s)

[pop-up box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h40m59s)

[oh I see like a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m01s)

[because like an input that you manually](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m05s)

[control to pop-up correct yeah because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m08s)

[that's that's the thing is if we like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m11s)

[the behavior of combo box and we just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m14s)

[want it to look differently we could](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m17s)

[restyle it easy enough but I think the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m18s)

[issue is we're fundamentally struggling](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m21s)

[against the behavior of it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m22s)

[which means we may want a different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m25s)

[control that has behavior that we want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m28s)

[and since pop-up box](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m30s)

[is something a little nicer to work with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m32s)

[that may be a cleaner solution where](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m35s)

[where is pop-up box so pop-up box is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m38s)

[over here](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m41s)

[so ignore the way this button looks](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m42s)

[but it allow it basically pop-up box is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m45s)

[a very simplistic control that's a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m48s)

[combination toggle button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m50s)

[and uh pop-up](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m53s)

[and we and we could even abandon the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m56s)

[pop-up box itself and just roll our own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h41m58s)

[pop-up control and build kind of a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m01s)

[custom control out for this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m04s)

[not a bad idea](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m07s)

[a custom control for picking the games](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m09s)

[yeah you could have a new component for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m13s)

[your material design](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m15s)

[yeah okay I don't know that it would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m17s)

[actually fit the how closely do you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m19s)

[adhere to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m21s)

[because there's like a spec for material](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m23s)

[design right and then there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m25s)

[as close as possible I will show you one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m28s)

[other](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m32s)

[actually I probably have it uh that's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m33s)

[not the right folder hang on the there](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m35s)

[is a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m38s)

[because the material design they threw](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m41s)

[that curveball at us with um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m45s)

[um with the material design three](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m49s)

[we do have material design three](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m52s)

[variants as well that are available to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m55s)

[us they're just in a separate demo app](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h42m57s)

[so you'll know it remarkably similar but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m00s)

[there's not there in terms of yeah go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m06s)

[away](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m10s)

[um there's not a lot](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m12s)

[there's not a lot of controls that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m19s)

[changed for the material design three](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m21s)

[stuff I mean obviously you you commented](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m23s)

[on the field stuff we left the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m26s)

[underscore one in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m31s)

[like we didn't remove it we left it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m32s)

[there and we just implemented the new](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m34s)

[stuff on top of it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m39s)

[I wonder why toggles is empty](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m40s)

[interesting I'll have to look at this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m44s)

[and this is still showing some of the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m45s)

[old material design two things because](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m47s)

[versioning then became a bit a little](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m50s)

[bit of a nightmare](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m52s)

[because everything's still in one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m54s)

[package and so all you have to do to get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m55s)

[the material design three stuff is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h43m58s)

[add add a single reference to material](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m01s)

[design three and you're Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m04s)

[but I don't gotcha I don't think there's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m06s)

[anything in here that necessarily helps](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m08s)

[that much like these things are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m11s)

[different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m12s)

[between them right there's that that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m14s)

[first animation fun little thing yeah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m16s)

[like WPF is not bad to do animation type](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m19s)

[stuff with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m22s)

[it's kind of convenient and for example](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m24s)

[we've got](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m25s)

[custom size](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m28s)

[for our check boxes something not](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m30s)

[trivial to do might I add](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m36s)

[surprisingly](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m37s)

[was the third one disabled](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m39s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m43s)

[but I am wondering if it would make more](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m45s)

[sense to build a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m47s)

[kind of a picker for that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m49s)

[could have a whole nuget package](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m53s)

[dedicated to the single](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m54s)

[single control don't joke people have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h44m57s)

[built derivative packages off of my](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m00s)

[material design library to basically add](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m03s)

[in controls because there's a long list](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m05s)

[of controls that people want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m07s)

[and the the there's a high bar for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m09s)

[putting them into the library](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m12s)

[because I need them to work in all cases](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m14s)

[not just in one particular use case so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m17s)

[if you do a custom control that's just](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m20s)

[for one thing in your app you can make](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m21s)

[assumptions](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m23s)

[but if it goes into the library I kind](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m24s)

[of need to work in a lot of different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m25s)

[cases I need to be re-templatable and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m27s)

[play nice and all of those things it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m29s)

[can't just have one template](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m31s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m33s)

[um that may be something worth chasing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m35s)

[I'm going to put this on a branch](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m40s)

[because we are closing in on midnight](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m42s)

[and I don't want to keep you up too late](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m44s)

[um yeah it seems like uh that component](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m47s)

[might be](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m50s)

[games relatively non-trivial](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m52s)

[I don't know](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h45m55s)

[and in games oh I want to go turn off](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m01s)

[the topmost thing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m03s)

[um you you're on top of everything stop](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m07s)

[it go away knock it off](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m11s)

[because it would be a it would be a nice](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m15s)

[thing to go in and add in and I I do](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m17s)

[agree it would probably make for a good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m19s)

[example of building out a custom control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m21s)

[I've done streams in the past of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m23s)

[building custom controls](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m25s)

[and they can get](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m27s)

[what did you uh what kind of controls](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m30s)

[did you build so the the stereotypical](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m32s)

[example is building out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m34s)

[no date oh my word don't scare me date](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m38s)

[Pickers are](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m41s)

[here let me if you do not understand the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m42s)

[pain and suffering the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m45s)

[people who build date Pickers are a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m49s)

[special type of crazy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m53s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m56s)

[I feel like every day picker I've ever](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m57s)

[used Works quite different](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h46m59s)

[from each other](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m01s)

[hey Texas is such a complex](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m04s)

[yeah well and it gets worse like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m07s)

[the the date picker control itself is a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m11s)

[a control that's built into WPF](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m15s)

[so remember that the control defines Its](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m18s)

[Behavior not necessarily its look so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m21s)

[we've put a different template on top of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m23s)

[it to give it a very material designy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m25s)

[look which is great and there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m27s)

[there's a lot of components that go into](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m29s)

[this this whole thing especially when](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m31s)

[you start saying oh let's just back out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m34s)

[to the year and let's do a year picker](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m36s)

[and then we want to do blackout dates](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m38s)

[and then we want to be able to go in and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m39s)

[pick a date like there's a lot that goes](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m41s)

[into that and then heaven forbid people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m43s)

[throw in right to left languages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m45s)

[and your World falls apart and then they](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m49s)

[decide that right to left languages](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m52s)

[aren't confusing enough let's throw out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m54s)

[the Gregorian calendar let's bring in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m56s)

[the Persian calendar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h47m58s)

[oh boy let me tell you things get crazy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m00s)

[gotta crack open another man dude for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m04s)

[that real crazy yeah so the moment you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m07s)

[say it needs to work in all cases](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m09s)

[thankfully WPF just doesn't support the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m10s)

[Persian calendar](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m13s)

[which is a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m14s)

[arguably a bug in WPF but I think it's](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m17s)

[more of an artifact of its age rather](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m21s)

[than anything else but there's there's a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m23s)

[number of bugs that I know people have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m25s)

[flagged my date picker for on the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m27s)

[Persian calendar and I'm going I like I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m28s)

[don't control the control like I would](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m31s)

[have to roll my own custom control that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m34s)

[handles the Persian calendar that does](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m36s)

[all of the same stuff that their date](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m38s)

[picker does like this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m41s)

[panic mode if you want if you want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m44s)

[how deep does the Rabbit Trail go](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m47s)

[date](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m50s)

[uh presentation framework yeah this is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m52s)

[what you would end up rebuilding and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m55s)

[there are a handful of things in here so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h48m58s)

[not terrible there's some dependency](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m00s)

[properties blah blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m02s)

[where's the scary stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m04s)

[selected date changed](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m05s)

[this is where somewhere in here this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m08s)

[thing jumps off the deep end where it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m11s)

[goes into culture info and figuring out](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m13s)

[all the appropriate date stuff and it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m17s)

[may be nested down several levels deep](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m19s)

[um and my head started spinning large](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m22s)

[class](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m25s)

[this is small for some of those](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m27s)

[but this is everything that's needed for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m29s)

[the date picker and you'll Note](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m31s)

[Everything in here is agnostic of what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m32s)

[the xaml view is like you could take the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m35s)

[entire template and if you decide you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m37s)

[know what](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m40s)

[I don't like this header this header is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m41s)

[dumb okay copy the existing template](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m44s)

[literally just delete the header out of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m46s)

[the xaml](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m48s)

[you're Off to the Races and you work](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m49s)

[well unless the control defines that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m50s)

[there's a particular thing in the UI](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m53s)

[that's critical for it to have](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m54s)

[everything's optional and so you can you](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h49m57s)

[can take things out of the controller](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m00s)

[even if the control says I really want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m01s)

[you to have this element you can say](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m03s)

[okay I add the element and I make it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m05s)

[invisible](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m07s)

[problem solved](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m09s)

[can you uh the support ranges](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m11s)

[uh this one does it that is actually one](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m15s)

[of the things that people that people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m18s)

[have asked for on here is being able to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m20s)

[go through and and pick out a range](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m22s)

[there there are a handful of people that](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m25s)

[have built date range Pickers](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m27s)

[and it's oftentimes a composite control](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m29s)

[of multiple date Pickers so like a start](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m32s)

[and end because oftentimes when people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m34s)

[want to arrange picker they really want](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m36s)

[that like hotels.com experience right](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m39s)

[where it shows like the month before the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m42s)

[month after and you kind of want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m44s)

[build out something that looks kind of](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m46s)

[like a date picker-ish but you want to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m48s)

[have a start date and an end date and it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m50s)

[gets it's not terrible to build we built](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m51s)

[it on one of our apps](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m56s)

[but it is kind of a pain](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m57s)

[yeah so and I it's one of those I've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h50m59s)

[contemplated building a control like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m02s)

[that out for people but I'm I still](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m04s)

[struggle on where is the appropriate](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m07s)

[level to build because every time I've](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m09s)

[built one of those things the how the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m11s)

[control works has been specific to the](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m14s)

[app that I've been building right and so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m16s)

[that's that's where it's like](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m19s)

[maybe other people would find usage in](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m20s)

[this but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m23s)

[maybe not I don't know I go back and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m24s)

[forth](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m27s)

[cool well this has been](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m31s)

[a fun intro for me into WPF and and](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m33s)

[hopefully the first of many you get to](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m36s)

[do more.net stuff](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m39s)

[and thank you for coming on it's always](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m41s)

[better to have somebody to to chat with](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m43s)

[and work with rather than me just going](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m45s)

[and doing this because I will talk for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m48s)

[three hours on my on my own](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m50s)

[yeah well thanks for having me](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m53s)

[especially last minute it's uh I](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m55s)

[probably slowed you down quite a bit but](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m57s)

[it's been fun being able to ask](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h51m59s)

[questions and stuff no I think I think](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m00s)

[like oftentimes I worry I go too fast](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m02s)

[for people and it's like ah fire hose](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m05s)

[nothing gets retained and so having](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m07s)

[somebody who's asking those questions is](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m09s)

[good for me I need it](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m11s)

[right on cool](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m14s)

[well](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m17s)

[oh not that button I I can't uh I need](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m18s)

[to I need to press the right button](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m22s)

[so let's go that button there we go okay](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m24s)

[thank you Joseph thank you everyone for](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m27s)

[coming and hanging out it's been a good](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m29s)

[time if anybody's interested in checking](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m31s)

[out the repository feel free I'm happy](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m33s)

[to take pull requests issues](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m35s)

[um again one of the objectives of this](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m37s)

[project is hopefully to be a learning](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m39s)

[area so maybe a custom control for doing](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m42s)

[this picker would be helpful for people](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m44s)

[to to see how you might build out a](https://youtu.be/QBeIdK95d9c?t=02h52m46s)
