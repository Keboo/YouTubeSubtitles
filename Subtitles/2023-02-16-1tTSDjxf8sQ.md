[hello everyone welcome back uh so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m01s)

[tonight I figured I'm going to do some](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m04s)

[PR review answer some questions go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m06s)

[through some issues](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m08s)

[answer any other questions that people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m09s)

[have uh basically](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m11s)

[it's been a long day and I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m14s)

[a chill night coding is my relaxation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m16s)

[activity so we're gonna write a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m18s)

[code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m20s)

[solve some problems do some debugging](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m21s)

[have some fun we'll go with that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m23s)

[um and then we will Circle back around](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m26s)

[to the the brain teaser towards the end](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m28s)

[for anybody interested](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m30s)

[um also](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m33s)

[small amount of Shame of self-promotion](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m35s)

[time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m37s)

[I wasn't actually prepped to do shame of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m38s)

[self-promotion](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m39s)

[but I'm gonna do it anyway](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m41s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m42s)

[uh for anybody not following me on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m44s)

[YouTube link right below me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m47s)

[um I started putting out some videos uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m49s)

[specifically shorter content ones around](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m52s)

[some of the brain teaser ones so if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m55s)

[people are interested in this uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h00m57s)

[pause don't want to listen to myself as](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m01s)

[excited as this is a big me little me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m04s)

[um there's the intro one the description](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m06s)

[here has the full playlist I'm going to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m09s)

[start adding more to these as we go the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m12s)

[other thing that is linked in here stop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m14s)

[autoplay you are really annoying is the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m16s)

[um the GitHub repo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m22s)

[I've had a bunch of brain teasers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m23s)

[either I've compiled or found or people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m26s)

[have sent them to me over the years and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m28s)

[I am starting to catalog them and put](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m31s)

[them in a single place where other](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m34s)

[people can play with them too so if you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m36s)

[are interested you want the list you're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m38s)

[looking for either the brain teasers one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m40s)

[here or the spot the bug so the the big](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m42s)

[difference between these is brain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m45s)

[teasers probably require you to do a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m46s)

[little bit of typing a little bit of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m48s)

[code exploration to do something whereas](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m49s)

[spot the bug you could theoretically do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m52s)

[them in uh just the browser if you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m54s)

[wanted to go that route](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m57s)

[uh sometimes there's a gonna be a unit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h01m58s)

[test or similar to go along with them to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m01s)

[validate Your solution but at the end of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m03s)

[the day it really is just about reading](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m04s)

[code and making sure that your uh mental](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m06s)

[processing of the code actually matches](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m10s)

[what's happening and oftentimes there is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m11s)

[something slightly um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m14s)

[devious afoot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m16s)

[um I say it in the intro true don't take](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m18s)

[the code that you see in this repo as a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m20s)

[good idea oftentimes good coding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m22s)

[practices mitigate a lot of these issues](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m24s)

[um so don't do bad things and bad things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m27s)

[will not happen](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m29s)

[okay so step one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m31s)

[um there is a long chat between Nikolai](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m34s)

[and I uh going back and forth along this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m38s)

[um this padding issue so to quickly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m42s)

[summarize the the sum total of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m46s)

[problem this all came about because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m48s)

[there was a couple issues that got](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m50s)

[logged](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m52s)

[um because people would go through and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m53s)

[set padding on one of the the text box](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m55s)

[templates](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h02m59s)

[and the unfortunate part is when you set](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m00s)

[a property on a control](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m02s)

[the control can choose to just ignore](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m04s)

[the property so in WPF the the UI](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m07s)

[elements for a control are called its](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m11s)

[template and then even though I control](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m13s)

[like a text box may have a padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m15s)

[property if nothing in the template](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m17s)

[consumes that property the property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m19s)

[effectively doesn't do anything so even](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m21s)

[though you may set it if nothing uses it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m24s)

[it doesn't matter that you set it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m27s)

[and that was fundamentally the issue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m30s)

[here is we we ran into a bunch of issues](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m32s)

[back and forth the problem being is this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m35s)

[starts to get a little weird and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m37s)

[especially since we've got like a text](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m39s)

[box view margin attached property or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m41s)

[similar so some of these things start to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m43s)

[get a little a little funky and I I like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m46s)

[this uh the demo that Nikolai put](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m49s)

[together here kind of showing the the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m52s)

[behavior of the various text boxes and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m54s)

[what should happen](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m57s)

[right like should the user change the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h03m59s)

[padding Right Now the default setup for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m01s)

[things like padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m03s)

[um roughly follows the material design](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m05s)

[spec I say roughly because the material](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m07s)

[design spec is kind of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m09s)

[um generic it it was never written for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m12s)

[WPF it was written as this basic design](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m14s)

[language that says here's the principles](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m18s)

[you should follow and in some cases they](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m19s)

[get principled enough to say you know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m22s)

[here's the size of things like your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m24s)

[corner radius](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m26s)

[which is good but even though that seems](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m27s)

[really detailed it's not exactly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m30s)

[specific because there's a lot of cases](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m31s)

[in WPF where things come up and there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m33s)

[isn't a right answer so this Library](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m35s)

[really does two things one it tries to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m38s)

[follow the material design spec as best](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m40s)

[it can uh when there's not clear](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m42s)

[guidance there we tend to fall back to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m45s)

[what is the default WPF Behavior](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m47s)

[and if that still doesn't clear up the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m50s)

[confusion then we take a best guess](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m52s)

[because at a certain point there's like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m54s)

[I don't know there's we get to decide I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h04m57s)

[guess so and sometimes we put something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m00s)

[in and users come back and go no that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m03s)

[horrible okay fair enough](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m05s)

[um so let's I want to take a look at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m09s)

[um this this PR here and just and just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m13s)

[work through it so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m18s)

[so there was a couple a couple comments](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m19s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m23s)

[uh yeah so Nikolai had commented that he](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m26s)

[already knows how to fix the the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m28s)

[misalignments probably doesn't have it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m30s)

[done by now not surprising](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m32s)

[like bear in mind everybody who works on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m34s)

[this project this is basically volunteer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m37s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m39s)

[there's dead when people ask you know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m40s)

[when's the next release coming it's my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m42s)

[answer is usually whenever it's ready](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m44s)

[or whenever I decide it's ready because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m47s)

[yeah even though I have a stream every](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m50s)

[week where I tend to work on this that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m52s)

[doesn't necessarily mean it's getting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m54s)

[the same number of hours every week or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m55s)

[that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m56s)

[when it's ready that's when we ship so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h05m58s)

[Side Story](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m01s)

[um I used to work for an employer and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m02s)

[when I got hired on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m04s)

[um I was hired on because they're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m05s)

[getting ready to produce this new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m07s)

[desktop app we were putting in a bunch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m08s)

[of features and I asked you know so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m10s)

[what's the release date for for this new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m13s)

[app and they're like when it's done and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m15s)

[I went](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m17s)

[what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m18s)

[I I had come from such a strong](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m19s)

[background of here's the here's the date](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m21s)

[you got to get everything in by this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m23s)

[date and the date's the most important](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m25s)

[thing it was very weird to work for a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m26s)

[company that took the opposite approach](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m28s)

[of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m30s)

[we're we we're not scope is the most](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m31s)

[important thing we want to make sure it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m34s)

[has all of these features we ship when](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m36s)

[the features are done](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m38s)

[it was very refreshing to work in that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m42s)

[kind of environment because it was there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m44s)

[it was never high stress the only debate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m46s)

[came whether you know is that feature](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m48s)

[going to take too long should that maybe](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m51s)

[go into the next version that was the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m52s)

[only discussion it was awesome love that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m54s)

[place uh okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h06m56s)

[um yeah so specifically calling into the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m00s)

[assessment uh text field text box view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m03s)

[margin should only be used to do the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m05s)

[content host or similar not the hints](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m07s)

[validation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m11s)

[uh the fact that Nikolai thinks it's the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m13s)

[right approach](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m15s)

[Nikolai is pretty smart he usually lands](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m17s)

[on the right answer so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m20s)

[uh helper invalidation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m24s)

[yeah horizontal content alignment so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m27s)

[Nick license I know you tend to watch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m30s)

[these recordings](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m31s)

[um on the note of the content alignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m33s)

[the other case that is always sitting in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m35s)

[the back of my mind that I often forget](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m38s)

[about is uh flow Direction because most](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m39s)

[of the time we always think flow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m43s)

[direction is left to right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m44s)

[however some places it gets set to right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m46s)

[to left and that is usually the same](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m49s)

[case as horizontal content alignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m52s)

[right but we've got a lot of cases where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m54s)

[I know our templates don't handle it and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m56s)

[it just doesn't work right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h07m58s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m00s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m02s)

[yeah so that that could be fun](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m04s)

[but let's take a look let's take a look](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m08s)

[there's not a lot here there's not a lot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m09s)

[here and we made we may check it out and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m11s)

[run it you know what let's start let's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m13s)

[actually start with checking out and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m15s)

[running let's see 3086. so we come here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m16s)

[get cracking uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m19s)

[uh let's see collapse that pull request](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m21s)

[3086. I would like to check this out](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m23s)

[uh could not find ref](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m27s)

[okay this is the bug](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m31s)

[this bothers me because I am clearly in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m33s)

[this state](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m36s)

[and I had reported this to get Kraken](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m40s)

[and they came back and weren't able to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m43s)

[reproduce](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m45s)

[and sorry I'm checking the logs real](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m47s)

[quick to see if there's anything else in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m49s)

[here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m52s)

[and then I tried to recreate it on a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h08m57s)

[an another project just going from](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m01s)

[scratch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m04s)

[and my reproduction steps didn't work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m06s)

[and I then dropped the ball and forgot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m10s)

[to do it so if you run into this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m12s)

[effectively the problem is because I've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m13s)

[got the remote hidden](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m15s)

[and I do and I and I think the steps](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m19s)

[might involve add the remote hide the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m21s)

[remote then do the pr with the remote](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m24s)

[then add the commits so that this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m26s)

[doesn't show up I think that might be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m29s)

[the the kicker so I need to add](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m30s)

[additional steps into my reproduction](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m33s)

[things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m35s)

[and find it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m36s)

[because it's clearly possible I know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m39s)

[it's possible I just demoed it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m41s)

[and for reference I am on version 9.1.1](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m45s)

[I feel like I'm missing something like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m52s)

[there was something I was meaning to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m53s)

[announce](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m55s)

[of coming up and I don't remember what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m57s)

[it was](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h09m59s)

[I really should have taken a note I I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m00s)

[had this mental thing earlier today](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m02s)

[where I was](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m04s)

[going through the items that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m05s)

[make sure I talked about and then I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m07s)

[completely spaced them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m10s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m12s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m16s)

[take a look](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m18s)

[so let's because I want to fire this up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m20s)

[and see because again the whole point](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m22s)

[here is all around this padding of what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m25s)

[should happen](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m28s)

[what should the text box look like when](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m29s)

[there is padding applied to it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m31s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m34s)

[Fields line up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m36s)

[this is a wonderful little guy here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m39s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m44s)

[uh validation error](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m51s)

[uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h10m57s)

[helper](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m00s)

[and there's the hints so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m04s)

[that works](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m11s)

[vertical padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m19s)

[that doesn't look bad that looks like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m27s)

[roughly what I would expect](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m29s)

[I just wanna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m35s)

[move that along a little bit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m37s)

[I mean it's obviously a little weird](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m41s)

[um just with this layout](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m44s)

[so when you have the the helper text the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m46s)

[or I should say the hint that that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m51s)

[floats](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m52s)

[and then the error text on top of it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h11m58s)

[that's definitely awkward but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m01s)

[I mean that's only due to how we've laid](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m04s)

[this out](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m06s)

[but Behavior wise that looks](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m13s)

[pretty much like I would expect so let's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m16s)

[take a look at this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m18s)

[uh this is just the demo app bits](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m19s)

[got it don't care](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m27s)

[uh smart hit don't care](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m29s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m33s)

[uh this is also](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m35s)

[let's just quickly look I'm only](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m39s)

[noticing this because this is doing a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m42s)

[bunch of code behind stuff for like fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m43s)

[visual child](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m45s)

[uh this is just so it can get in and do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m48s)

[the Val uh oh that's clever](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m50s)

[so it's actually somewhat difficult the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m53s)

[fact that I was able to just type in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m55s)

[this air and have a validation error](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m56s)

[show up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h12m58s)

[it's actually somewhat difficult to have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m00s)

[that work so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m02s)

[it's actually kind of nice that that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m04s)

[in here oftentimes this API is not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m06s)

[something that people even know exists](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m09s)

[and they often do things with like weird](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m11s)

[binding validation stuff to make it work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m13s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m15s)

[that works rather well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m18s)

[because you'll know to Mark something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m20s)

[invalid or to clear it you actually have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m22s)

[to have the binding and the air](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m24s)

[another common approach is like the I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m26s)

[data air info](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m29s)

[path to to force things into that case](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m30s)

[binding expression getting the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m36s)

[appropriate binding based upon the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m38s)

[target type great great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m39s)

[find Visual child](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m42s)

[I'm surprised we needed this in the demo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m43s)

[app look I thought we had](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m46s)

[thought we had this in the main app but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m49s)

[it may be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h13m58s)

[but it may be internal and that could be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m01s)

[why it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m04s)

[yeah that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m08s)

[fine child yeah okay got it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m13s)

[yeah so we have it it's just internal](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m17s)

[which is why the demo app can't touch it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m20s)

[okay that's fine that's fine that's fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m22s)

[Uh custom padding converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m26s)

[great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m31s)

[so there is a clever trick and have we](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m33s)

[rev the library up for c-sharp 11 yet](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m41s)

[where's my Lane version uh probably in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m47s)

[props Lang version 11. okay I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m49s)

[show this because this this is kind of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m52s)

[cool that was what was the name of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m54s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m56s)

[a custom padding converter there's a new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m57s)

[thing in C sharp 11.](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h14m59s)

[um is called list pattern matching and I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m02s)

[think I briefly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m05s)

[demo this on a prior stream uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m07s)

[in C sharp so there's a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m11s)

[a prior stream where I went through the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m15s)

[various features in uh c-sharp 11. but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m17s)

[this list pattern is is it so if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m20s)

[anybody's interested in if anybody's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m24s)

[interested in looking at it there's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m27s)

[uh let's see putting the link up so it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m30s)

[doesn't force you to English there you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m32s)

[are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m35s)

[but there is a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m37s)

[there's a clever trick because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m40s)

[oftentimes in these uh multi-valueue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m42s)

[converters you take in an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m45s)

[array and the first step in most](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m47s)

[multi-value converters is to pretty much](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m50s)

[check the elements of the array to make](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m52s)

[sure that they are the types you expect](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m54s)

[that's that's just how it goes so a one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h15m57s)

[one so this one this value converter is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m01s)

[just straight up casting and saying you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m04s)

[know what we're we're doing the thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m07s)

[and we're just gonna go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m12s)

[but there's an another way of doing this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m13s)

[where you use the list pattern matching](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m15s)

[so you go where values](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m17s)

[is and then Square braces for the list](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m20s)

[pattern match and then we look at each](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m22s)

[element in the in the array hey Justin](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m25s)

[Bieber](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m28s)

[uh so the first one would be a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m29s)

[uh thickness](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m32s)

[uh next one would be a Bool next one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m34s)

[would be a non-nullable thickness and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m39s)

[that's it and then what we do here is we](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m43s)

[do we call this default padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m45s)

[uh apply](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m49s)

[just going to copy and paste because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m52s)

[typing is hard for me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m54s)

[and then custom padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m56s)

[goes here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h16m59s)

[like that and then we do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m03s)

[and then what we do is we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m06s)

[here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m10s)

[well we can actually](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m12s)

[so you you stop your whining](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m14s)

[it's only unhappy because we've got the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m17s)

[same value declared down below](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m21s)

[thickness is a type which is not valid](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m23s)

[in the current context](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m35s)

[uh yes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m36s)

[what is your problem](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m44s)

[do I not have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m46s)

[oh one I'm debugging that's that's not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m48s)

[helping my case oh I no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m51s)

[I don't know I should have access to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m55s)

[this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m57s)

[uh oh I what do you bet I have to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h17m59s)

[this maneuver](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m02s)

[uh there shouldn't be anything](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m05s)

[why have my syntax wrong](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m11s)

[uh let's see pattern matching](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m14s)

[nope uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m23s)

[uh collection is square brace](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m26s)

[oh it's the null ability that it doesn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m37s)

[like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m39s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m43s)

[oh because it doesn't handle null](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m46s)

[well that's interesting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m53s)

[that is interesting so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h18m58s)

[this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m00s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m02s)

[and then we're gonna go and uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m03s)

[apply custom padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m07s)

[or actually maybe we'll do the the apply](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m10s)

[custom padding so we'll do here if apply](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m12s)

[custom padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m15s)

[right so we'll do the true case uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m17s)

[return](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m21s)

[Uh custom padding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m22s)

[and then the else case is default](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m25s)

[padding or dependency property onset](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m27s)

[value uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m30s)

[uh return default padding as](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m33s)

[thickness](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m36s)

[uh dependency property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m39s)

[onset value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m41s)

[uh you can discard values or include or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m44s)

[et cetera yeah the the one what I really](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m48s)

[want to do is this and I'm not entirely](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m51s)

[clear](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m53s)

[why it's unhappy about that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h19m58s)

[I because I realize in this case](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m04s)

[thickness is a struct and so I'm doing a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m06s)

[nullable struct](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m08s)

[but I don't understand why I can't list](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m10s)

[pattern match](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m12s)

[into that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m14s)

[because that's really what I want so in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m22s)

[this case I'm just going VAR which is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m24s)

[effectively object which says I don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m26s)

[care let's let's not stress about it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m27s)

[right now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m31s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m32s)

[yeah could this be a new brain teaser](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m42s)

[it it probably should be and some of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m44s)

[these newer features do lend themselves](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m46s)

[well to uh to brain teasers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m48s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m52s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m56s)

[anybody's if anybody's late to the party](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h20m58s)

[there is the current brain teaser that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m01s)

[there and actually what I will do is I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m04s)

[will this is the best part about having](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m07s)

[my own repo for these now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m09s)

[I can just I can just link to them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m11s)

[uh brain teasers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m15s)

[and this one if people recall so it is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m18s)

[long class name](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m21s)

[so there's tonight's brain teaser for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m25s)

[anybody interested](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m27s)

[but the the whole point of going through](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m29s)

[I like I'm not going to leave this code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m31s)

[in here but for anybody interested if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m33s)

[you're doing a multi-value converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m36s)

[list pattern matching is awesome](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m37s)

[because it lets you when I first saw the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m42s)

[list pattern match even though it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m46s)

[supports things like being able to say](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m47s)

[oh any number of characters at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m49s)

[beginning or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m51s)

[or any number of uh I shouldn't say](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m53s)

[characters any number of items in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m56s)

[array at the beginning or or you can do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m58s)

[the dot dot at the end either like you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h21m59s)

[can kind of do arbitrary length but at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m01s)

[the end of the day when you're doing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m04s)

[list pattern matching it's because you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m05s)

[expect to find something specific in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m07s)

[at some index in the right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m11s)

[hey toxic Stacy how's it going](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m14s)

[so when so list pattern matching awesome](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m18s)

[for multi-value converters because the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m21s)

[vast majority of the time multi-value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m24s)

[converters you have a known number of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m26s)

[elements in the array and you have a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m28s)

[specific type of each element in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m31s)

[array that you're expecting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m33s)

[almost by definition it's really hard](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m35s)

[like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m38s)

[because of the way you declare multiple](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m39s)

[multi-bindings it's pretty rare in fact](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m41s)

[I don't know if I've ever done it where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m44s)

[I had an arbitrary number of items in my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m46s)

[values array like there's occasionally](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m48s)

[times where I make my converter handle](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m50s)

[like a couple different number of items](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m52s)

[but it's rare to have more than like two](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m55s)

[or three cases](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h22m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m00s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m02s)

[sorry](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m06s)

[Stacy that was to your married comment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m08s)

[uh okay so I'm gonna throw this away](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m11s)

[because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m13s)

[I don't wanna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m15s)

[I don't want to mess up what uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m16s)

[yes you can it was actually a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m22s)

[if I can get it to focus](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m25s)

[I don't know if I can get it to focus](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m28s)

[properly it was a custom one designed to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m30s)

[look like a circuit board that my uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m32s)

[wife designed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m38s)

[uh let's see so that goes back there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m41s)

[and then we were gonna keep looking at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m45s)

[this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m47s)

[so that's all good no there's nothing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m49s)

[wrong there uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m51s)

[yeah it was really nice I I had done a a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m53s)

[custom one for her engagement ring and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h23m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m00s)

[she took inspiration from there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m01s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m03s)

[I love when I see fix me comments](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m06s)

[because that always indicates something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m08s)

[to look at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m10s)

[um but I love this here so this is a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m11s)

[a UI test and I might just go look at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m16s)

[this in because this is kind of hard to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m18s)

[review here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m20s)

[let's look at that let's look at this in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m21s)

[code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m24s)

[is this one of the Rings of powers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m32s)

[sort of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m32s)

[but not in that same context](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m35s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m37s)

[that's a long line but whatever it's a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m41s)

[fix me comment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m43s)

[uh is in play and slightly modifies the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m45s)

[hint so this is only here to adjust it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m49s)

[got it okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m53s)

[so this entire test rips through various](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h24m56s)

[styles on the text box so you can see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m00s)

[it's building up the style attribute](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m02s)

[based upon an incoming bit of data](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m04s)

[so if you're people not familiar with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m08s)

[this this is a a dated different test so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m10s)

[X unit you do that with a theory and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m13s)

[then they've got various ways of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m15s)

[providing the parameters to your unit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m17s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m18s)

[I've heard some people say oh you can't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m19s)

[have unit tests with parameters no you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m21s)

[you can and I think all of the big uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m24s)

[the Limitless power of WPF Marvel](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m30s)

[um so let's see sets the style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m35s)

[if padding comes in with a non-no value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m38s)

[it sets a padding otherwise it does](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m41s)

[string empty and then it slaps those](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m43s)

[things into here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m45s)

[um and then Away We Go There](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m49s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m53s)

[pulls the elements out verifies the size](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m55s)

[I love everything about this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h25m58s)

[so the get coordinates is just the way](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h26m01s)

[that's largely on me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h26m52s)

[but that was the whole point of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h26m54s)

[xaml test so that we could actually deal](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h26m55s)

[with this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h26m58s)

[um fixed left fixed right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m13s)

[so this is also another good](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m16s)

[um lesson for people on value converters](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m19s)

[so oftentimes when building a value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m21s)

[converter in WPF you've obviously got](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m24s)

[the incoming bound value so whatever](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m26s)

[whatever value you bound to comes in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m28s)

[here you do also have a converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m31s)

[parameter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m33s)

[um but sometimes people ask well hey how](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m35s)

[can I pass more than one parameter this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m37s)

[question actually came up from a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m39s)

[colleague week an app ago two weeks ago](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m40s)

[um he he was wanting to build a value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m44s)

[converter and wanted to pass more than](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m46s)

[one parameter and I told them you know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m47s)

[because the the API and WPF only ever](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m50s)

[allows you to pass one thing as your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m53s)

[parameter now you can change what that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m55s)

[thing is right you can make your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h28m58s)

[parameter be some class that has a bunch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m00s)

[of stuff in it but in his case all he](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m02s)

[wanted to do was have a fixed value so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m05s)

[that one instance of the converter used](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m07s)

[one value in another instance use](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m09s)

[another I was like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m11s)

[just make a property on the converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m12s)

[and that part was the surprising bit of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m14s)

[wait you can do that and the answer is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m17s)

[absolutely so if we go let's hunt where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m19s)

[this is used](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m22s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m24s)

[oh interesting this appears to be unused](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m26s)

[I'm also noticing this shows zero](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m30s)

[references uh is this dead code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m31s)

[no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m35s)

[there oh clone edges is used so this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m37s)

[actually a way you can do it so when you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m41s)

[declare your converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m42s)

[you can't data bind these properties so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m44s)

[they have to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m48s)

[quote unquote fixed but it does allow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m49s)

[you to use the converter in a variety to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m52s)

[reuse your converter somewhat in a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m56s)

[variety of ways like in this case it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m57s)

[changing the Clone edges property from](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h29m59s)

[all to left so that when it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m02s)

[copying this thickness object around](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m05s)

[because you can see it takes in a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m07s)

[thickness and then based upon which](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m09s)

[edges it's supposed to clone or which](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m12s)

[ones have fixed values it goes through](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m14s)

[and copies them over and then makes a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m16s)

[new thickness object](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m19s)

[which this is a a perfect example of a a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m21s)

[great value converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m25s)

[I'm glad it's I'm glad it's public](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m28s)

[because I have a feeling this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m30s)

[something other people may end up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m31s)

[using I may have to actually poach this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m33s)

[for another one like this is a great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m36s)

[example of good design](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m40s)

[though I might propose this could be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m41s)

[dropped](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m43s)

[because you don't need to initialize](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m44s)

[values to non-defaults](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m46s)

[but again it allows you to uh by putting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m49s)

[straight Auto properties on your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m53s)

[converters it allows you to do things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m55s)

[like this and then if we look at a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m57s)

[different instance of it right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h30m59s)

[so I guess not all of the fixed sizes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m02s)

[are being used I picked on one of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m04s)

[ones that wasn't but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m06s)

[um for example three three instances of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m08s)

[this converter because when you declare](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m11s)

[them in the resources this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m13s)

[effectively calling new on your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m14s)

[converter three times](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m16s)

[so instantiate instance one instance two](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m18s)

[instance three give those things a key](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m21s)

[into the dictionary that they're going](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m24s)

[to be referenced by](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m26s)

[and then uh clone the edges so in this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m27s)

[case it's always picking on left and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m31s)

[then a couple of these have fixed top](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m33s)

[fix bottom things set on them the other](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m35s)

[thing to note is these converters are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m37s)

[declared inside of the control template](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m39s)

[rather than outside I suspect that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m41s)

[very intentional as to not accidentally](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m43s)

[expose these things out](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m45s)

[this one here should probably not be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m48s)

[exposed outside this is probably a bug](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m51s)

[um this is also the built-in WPF](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m55s)

[converter so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h31m57s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m00s)

[beautiful so this is a beautiful example](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m02s)

[of how to write a value converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m05s)

[um this is also while we're on the topic](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m07s)

[I'm just going to keep going Nikolai if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m10s)

[you're watching this is a perfect](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m12s)

[example of great work so what's up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m13s)

[um enums this is another thing I see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m17s)

[people get wrong and C sharp all of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m19s)

[the time so there's a general principle](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m21s)

[that when you declare Anem](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m23s)

[um you uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m26s)

[you don't do the following](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m29s)

[right this is bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m33s)

[and we'll even we'll even go through and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m36s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m38s)

[right and the reason this is bad is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m40s)

[because enums are just magically named](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m43s)

[values for for numbers and I'm using the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m45s)

[term number because you can technically](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m48s)

[change them from ins to like shorts or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m50s)

[units or whatever in general you don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m53s)

[need to change the backing type of of an](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m56s)

[enemy unless you have a good reason to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m57s)

[do so don't touch it you'll probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h32m59s)

[only make things worse](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m02s)

[um should the Indian be enclosed in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m04s)

[converter no and I'll get](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m06s)

[uh get to why that's important in a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m09s)

[moment but the with enums the thing you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m11s)

[always have to be aware of is foo foo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m14s)

[gets default right the default value for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m18s)

[an enum is always zero](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m22s)

[okay I'll say that again the default](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m26s)

[value of an enum is always zero so if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m28s)

[you declare an enume like this it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m31s)

[common to think that that these are the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m33s)

[only values your enum can have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m35s)

[the the problem is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m37s)

[that's valid I I can put any value I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m41s)

[want into the enume it just doesn't have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m45s)

[a name anymore](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m47s)

[so so don't do that so the the best](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m49s)

[practice recommendation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m54s)

[uh when you're declaring an enem always](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m56s)

[declare a zeroth member right and if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h33m58s)

[zero doesn't make sense for your enum](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m01s)

[give it a name like a known none invalid](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m03s)

[something right that way that way ever](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m07s)

[the the zeroth value of an enum should](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m10s)

[have a name I'll put it that way and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m13s)

[then Flags just means that your values](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m15s)

[are expected to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m18s)

[um bit wise or together](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m20s)

[or bitwise operators are expected on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m22s)

[your enum and the value should make](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m25s)

[sense in those cases](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m26s)

[um and then should the union be enclosed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m28s)

[in the converter uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m30s)

[I so no because if you put it inside so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m33s)

[nested types in xaml are weird](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m37s)

[in this case we might actually be able](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m42s)

[to get away with it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m44s)

[let me think about this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m46s)

[um the the uh the way you end up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m49s)

[referencing a nested class anytime you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m52s)

[need something's type is to put a plus](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m54s)

[in front of it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m56s)

[so for example right here this is the so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h34m58s)

[when we just specify left](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m02s)

[the um the type converter takes over and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m04s)

[zail and goes hang on I know the type of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m07s)

[your property it's the enum type I know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m09s)

[that this name matches a name in your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m12s)

[email so like when I pop intellisense](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m13s)

[because it can look at the enum it knows](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m16s)

[what it should be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m18s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m20s)

[um the other way you can specify these](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m21s)

[is with a static and then we can go with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m24s)

[uh converters](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m27s)

[and then thickness edges Dot and then I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m30s)

[can go through and do I can do something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m34s)

[like this right so both of these end up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m36s)

[being equivalent](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m38s)

[the problem comes if we take this guy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m40s)

[and for example I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m43s)

[I'm going to copy this just so that I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m45s)

[don't so I can show them side by side if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m47s)

[I put a nested one in here I'll just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m50s)

[call it Foo the way you end up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m52s)

[referencing this is you have to do plus](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m54s)

[Foo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m57s)

[oh and then you have to compile so that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h35m59s)

[it actually finds it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m01s)

[so another worth file thing to note the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m03s)

[the xaml designer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m05s)

[almost universally works on compiled](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m08s)

[code so if it's not finding a type that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m11s)

[you just wrote](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m14s)

[do a compile and then it'll find it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m15s)

[kind of annoying](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m18s)

[and it's only annoying because it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m20s)

[what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m24s)

[uh uh public enum](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m26s)

[oh is it because it's not a class](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m29s)

[oh it might not even get exposed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m38s)

[uh converters oh it's because I went](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m43s)

[through the wrong](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m46s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m48s)

[uh thickness clone converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h36m55s)

[uh why are you not finding thickness](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m00s)

[clone converter I know you're in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m02s)

[dot left](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m11s)

[and this is where this is why I don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m18s)

[like the nested classes because things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m20s)

[start to get weird](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m22s)

[and I'm I'm messing up on the syntax](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m25s)

[here but generally you don't want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m27s)

[have a nested a nested type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m30s)

[um Exposed on your public API especially](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m34s)

[for things like xaml it gets ugly fast](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m37s)

[so the fact that this is outside I think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m40s)

[makes perfect sense given that it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m44s)

[public](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m46s)

[if it was expected to be hidden and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m47s)

[because this type is exposed as a public](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m49s)

[property Here If This Were Made internal](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m51s)

[then this property would have to go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m54s)

[internal and things get weird so I I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m55s)

[kind of like it as it sits if we didn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h37m58s)

[want to expose the converter we could](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m01s)

[make it internal we've done this on a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m02s)

[lot of converters in the past](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m04s)

[where converters are are hidden from](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m06s)

[people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m09s)

[um the problem that has come up many](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m11s)

[times is people like to be able to copy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m14s)

[the Styles wholesale into their app and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m17s)

[then tweak](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m19s)

[and what happens is if you copy a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m21s)

[converter in that's internal](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m23s)

[you can know the style that works in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m25s)

[library doesn't work in your app and so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m28s)

[you can't copy it out so I've tried to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m30s)

[make as many of the things that are in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m33s)

[the xaml public as possible there are a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m34s)

[handful of times where I've still kept](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m37s)

[things internal because it's a very](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m38s)

[purpose-built thingy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m40s)

[and it's like I I don't want to take bug](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m43s)

[reports and responsibility for people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m46s)

[tweaking something that's public when](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m48s)

[they shouldn't be touching it so it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m50s)

[you still can make it work you just then](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m54s)

[have to also copy the internal things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m56s)

[into your project as well so it's a pain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h38m58s)

[so it gets to be annoying but it's it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m00s)

[not unworkable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m02s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m06s)

[so beautiful example of a value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m09s)

[converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m11s)

[uh let's see template binding horizontal](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m14s)

[alignment use floating](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m18s)

[that all looks as I expected and I think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m20s)

[this all actually lines up with what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m25s)

[what I reviewed last time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m30s)

[because I've reviewed this PR now a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m34s)

[couple of times and I don't think a lot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m36s)

[has changed since I looked at it before](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m43s)

[thickness clone Edge](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m46s)

[there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m52s)

[okay so and then](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m56s)

[to go back to the original question here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h39m59s)

[should only be used to manipulate uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m01s)

[part content host and similar and not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m04s)

[hints](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m06s)

[um so I want to reply to that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m08s)

[specifically](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m10s)

[uh uh quote replay uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m12s)

[let's see uh let's see so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m17s)

[um we're gonna clear that clear that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m21s)

[clear that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m24s)

[So Pro tip GitHub the uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m25s)

[the angle brace or alligator brace is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m28s)

[how you do quoted replies](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m35s)

[uh leave](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m38s)

[let's grab this guy Let's uh only using](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m41s)

[uh for the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m47s)

[content host](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m50s)

[uh is correct](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m52s)

[um the placement of help learn](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m56s)

[validation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h40m57s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m01s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m03s)

[those can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m05s)

[be uh separate uh PRS](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m07s)

[but I think they should](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m12s)

[uh move](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m17s)

[well should they](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m19s)

[I think validation should move should](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m33s)

[hint move as well oh man this is this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m36s)

[hard](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m40s)

[is there a situation where somebody](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m41s)

[would want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m44s)

[for example Center align their hint or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m46s)

[validation and not their text](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m50s)

[or Center align their text and not their](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m53s)

[hint and validation is that a thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m55s)

[people would want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h41m57s)

[I really shouldn't I feel like I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m00s)

[teeing myself up to get more bug reports](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m02s)

[when would you want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m09s)

[a validation error](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m13s)

[when would you want a validation error](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m21s)

[and not and have it not follow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m23s)

[that's the question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m28s)

[if you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m31s)

[horizontally align your text Center do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m33s)

[you want your hint centered](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m37s)

[so there's two options here we could](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m42s)

[have the hint and the validation error](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m44s)

[follow the same](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m46s)

[uh content alignment that's option one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m48s)

[and then it would end up following the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m51s)

[position of the the the text](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m53s)

[which makes reasonable sense](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m56s)

[the other option is to introduce a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h42m59s)

[individual attached properties for them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m03s)

[so that they could be directly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m05s)

[manipulated](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m06s)

[I think I'm inclined to say that they](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m12s)

[should follow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m14s)

[the content the horizontal content](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m16s)

[alignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m18s)

[we could always add an attached property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m22s)

[later if somebody wants them to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m24s)

[disjointed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m26s)

[I think that's I think that's the answer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m27s)

[uh I think they sh should](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m30s)

[follow the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m33s)

[uh alignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m41s)

[should also](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m42s)

[consider flow Direction](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m52s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m53s)

[okay so there's that there's that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m55s)

[there's that okay let's go look at some](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m57s)

[more stuff wow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h43m58s)

[apparently I've gotten GitHub in a very](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m02s)

[awkward](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m04s)

[GitHub you got a bug](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m08s)

[um okay there was some discussion items](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m11s)

[I was going to look at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m14s)

[uh let's see so there was this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m17s)

[discussion](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m20s)

[and this one caught my eye](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m22s)

[uh I signed the message of an exception](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m29s)

[to the snack bar unfortunately only one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m32s)

[line is displayed and the rest of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m34s)

[message is truncated although a line](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m36s)

[break is possible](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m37s)

[so there's a couple things going on here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m39s)

[one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m41s)

[one so a snack bar in material design is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m48s)

[not meant to expand in height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m52s)

[there's that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m56s)

[but the question here is how to how to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h44m57s)

[violate that rule](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m00s)

[that's the other thing that this Library](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m02s)

[tries a very](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m03s)

[tentative line is sometimes people want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m05s)

[to do things that are very reasonable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m08s)

[that they probably shouldn't do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m13s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m16s)

[I tried my best to make sure that the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m18s)

[library allows people enough slack to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m21s)

[hang themselves](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m24s)

[this feels like one of those cases so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m25s)

[because the the knee-jerk reaction is to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m28s)

[say don't do that but that's not that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m31s)

[not overly helpful now more importantly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m33s)

[I thought I had a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m35s)

[uh I thought I had an example of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m38s)

[we're going to just briefly go and take](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m42s)

[a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m44s)

[if we don't we might just make one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m48s)

[uh nope no sample there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m50s)

[let's look at the demo real quick](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m53s)

[because I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m55s)

[I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m57s)

[had sworn there was a sample that showed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h45m59s)

[a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m02s)

[snack bar with multiple lines](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m04s)

[uh full width](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m08s)

[and I don't remember if we](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m13s)

[let's see so this is a snack bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m22s)

[content](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m25s)

[and this guy does show multiple bits](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m36s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m46s)

[so let's back up and take a quick Gander](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m51s)

[did the original poster include a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m54s)

[version number](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h46m56s)

[it does show I mean they were convenient](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m03s)

[enough to give me this so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m07s)

[let's do we have a way where we can plug](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m10s)

[this in easily](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m13s)

[uh let's see message will hide](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m16s)

[uh this doesn't allow me to add multiple](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m21s)

[lines so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m23s)

[let's change this so that I can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m25s)

[uh example three in snack bar so let's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m28s)

[just uh let's get ourselves off of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m31s)

[Branch though I'm back on master](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m35s)

[switch back uh okay so let's go here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m37s)

[that's not the demo app let's try this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m43s)

[again](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m45s)

[demos demo app snack bars it's under s](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m47s)

[last I checked](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m50s)

[dude](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m54s)

[okay so there's a whole bunch of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h47m56s)

[now this is one thing that could also be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m01s)

[improved in here as well so when you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m03s)

[have a bunch of lines like this so a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m05s)

[text block can actually support](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m10s)

[uh multiple lines through runs rather](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m12s)

[than a single text property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m15s)

[so going that route gives you a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m18s)

[bit more control the only advantage of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m20s)

[that well I should say only Advantage a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m22s)

[mild advantage of that is then all of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m25s)

[the text moves as one unit rather than](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m27s)

[being disjointed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m29s)

[and you can put line breaks in it and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m31s)

[all kinds of stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m33s)

[that's pretty](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m34s)

[uh let's see this guy here I want to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m35s)

[what is it accepts return true](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m39s)

[okay hello world](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m42s)

[why don't you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m49s)

[what is it uh Max lines 10](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h48m54s)

[why are you not rapping](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m03s)

[why are you not rapping why am I dumb](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m08s)

[uh let's see vertical alignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m10s)

[steps return I am I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m14s)

[why am I blinking on this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m18s)

[start the app my um did hot reload just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m21s)

[failed me or that not the incantation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m24s)

[I thought that was the incantation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m36s)

[uh let's see snack bar boom hello world](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m39s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m43s)

[next line](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m45s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m50s)

[uh oh runs can get tricky with the Ido](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m52s)

[code formatting though extra line breaks](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m55s)

[and spaces can't remember which one can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m56s)

[get added due to a uh Auto formatting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h49m58s)

[that that is fair so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m01s)

[um depending on how how you go through](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m04s)

[and add them that is an excellent point](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m06s)

[um if you are putting things in with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m09s)

[so generally when I'm doing text-based](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m12s)

[stuff I prefer to keep everything inside](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m15s)

[of an attribute to avoid that problem](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m17s)

[because I I assume the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m20s)

[I think this is the the case that you're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m23s)

[probably hitting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m25s)

[um so where you do a run like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m27s)

[the moment you start putting things in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m30s)

[side of uh the content of things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m33s)

[can get really weird in the IDE](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m37s)

[especially if you turn on something like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m39s)

[xaml formatter you can get bit The Way I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m41s)

[tend to work around it though is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m44s)

[just not to use the content bit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m48s)

[because then I can then I can still do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m51s)

[something you know uh line break](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m53s)

[uh and then another run](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h50m56s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m02s)

[but you are absolutely correct and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m04s)

[that's one of those things that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m06s)

[I really wish would have gotten cleaned](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m09s)

[up with some xaml Designer work is have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m11s)

[it uh of that as have it not do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m14s)

[like I wish there was an option](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m16s)

[well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m19s)

[my My Pie in the Sky dream is I want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m20s)

[Source generators for xaml or and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m23s)

[analyzers for xaml I want what C sharp](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m26s)

[has](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m29s)

[in xaml because I would love to be able](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m29s)

[to write and analyze it that says yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m32s)

[no content between element tags](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m35s)

[right all content goes in and well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m38s)

[all literal string content goes in an](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m42s)

[attribute](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m44s)

[because of that exact point is you can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m45s)

[get bit because then you get people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m47s)

[doing weird things like with like XML](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m49s)

[what is it there's the XML space yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m51s)

[yeah you get you start to see crap like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m55s)

[that in your xaml and I start twitching](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h51m58s)

[it's like oh oh oh no no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m01s)

[oh twitch twitch that's bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m05s)

[um yeah so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m08s)

[don't do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m10s)

[but yes you are absolutely correct if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m13s)

[you put content inside of inside of your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m15s)

[element tags](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m17s)

[you're kind of asking for it a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m18s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m20s)

[um what bothers me is this appears to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m23s)

[work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m25s)

[okay so that's two lines](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m31s)

[third line](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m33s)

[ah so that my okay so there okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m37s)

[there's the limit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m44s)

[this might be what I'm remembering of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m45s)

[there was some work done on the snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m48s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m50s)

[to limit its height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m51s)

[and let me just confirm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m54s)

[material design uh design component nope](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h52m57s)

[not icons components](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m01s)

[I'm really bad at this uh I don't know I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m06s)

[don't think it's actually](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m09s)

[I think it's it might I don't know if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m13s)

[three has it so we'll check both](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m16s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m20s)

[there is one type of Snack Bar in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m23s)

[material](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m26s)

[yep uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m27s)

[uh yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m35s)

[so this one does not give a lot of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m38s)

[Direction I believe](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m40s)

[they're not a switch this into dark mode](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m43s)

[option](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m45s)

[that's disappointing I apologize to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m47s)

[everybody whose screens just got really](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m49s)

[bright](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m52s)

[snack bar banner dialogue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h53m56s)

[text label](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m02s)

[yeah this line here so this this is the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m06s)

[limitation that we implemented](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m09s)

[and this is probably so we implemented](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m12s)

[can contain up to two lines of text](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m16s)

[but I'm noticing that this says on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m18s)

[mobile](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m20s)

[and I don't think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m21s)

[I don't think we can make an argument](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m23s)

[that WPF is a mobile based framework](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m25s)

[so the question becomes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m35s)

[oh slight transparency is allowed that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m43s)

[unusual to see that it though it is with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m46s)

[caution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m48s)

[um a lot of the material design stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m50s)

[really does not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m53s)

[the it's it is they strongly limit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h54m56s)

[um opacity and strongly limit like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m00s)

[gradients](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m03s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m09s)

[uh if an action is long it can be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m11s)

[displayed on a third line so we have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m13s)

[this right we bump the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m15s)

[the label down to a third line](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m17s)

[so the question is if somebody wants to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m20s)

[bump up the snack bar message to contain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m23s)

[arbitrary amounts of text right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m26s)

[what what do you have to do to change](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m31s)

[this sizing so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m33s)

[let's let's go a spelunking because this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m37s)

[uh let's see snack bar where is well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m42s)

[what is that button bound to I guess is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m45s)

[the question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m47s)

[let's see button](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m48s)

[you straighten the code behind](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m52s)

[okay so this is just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m54s)

[grab the text and cue it and away we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h55m58s)

[okay that seems very reasonable so this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m05s)

[looks like a perfect example to play](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m09s)

[with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m11s)

[so then the question becomes what is in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m12s)

[I'm going to close some of this stuff up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m15s)

[let's go look at snack bar and see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m17s)

[what's there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m18s)

[so this would probably be a reasonable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m20s)

[example of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m22s)

[more or less the exact process I go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m25s)

[through when people ask questions on the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m27s)

[library this is also why not all](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m29s)

[questions get answered because sometimes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m31s)

[because this amount of work is often](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m32s)

[difficult and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m34s)

[slows him down what's up Robert](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m36s)

[yes lots of WPF and fun WPF](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m39s)

[who am I kidding all WPF is fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m48s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m51s)

[this is smart hit I clicked on the wrong](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m54s)

[one let's try this again](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m56s)

[so that's the action button we don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m58s)

[care don't care don't care don't care](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h56m59s)

[those are just variations on color snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m03s)

[bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m06s)

[and this is where height gets](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m08s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m10s)

[hey mini 4G thank you for the sub I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m16s)

[appreciate it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m19s)

[when you break out Snoop things are not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m20s)

[fun let's be honest with the audience](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m22s)

[Robert you're spoiling the Ed we'll get](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m25s)

[to Snoop in a minute](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m28s)

[uh okay so this Max height is likely](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m29s)

[what is constricting us](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m33s)

[uh so this is snack bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m37s)

[Max content height so that is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m40s)

[so this is on the message itself](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m47s)

[and I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m51s)

[since I don't see a direct assignment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m54s)

[there I'm guessing this attached](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m57s)

[property is set in well one I'm assuming](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h57m59s)

[it's an attached property I'm guessing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m02s)

[the default is taking place](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m04s)

[00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:15,480](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m06s)

content Max height this is probably what

[is breaking our](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m12s)

[our original poster so if we go back](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m15s)

[here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m18s)

[because we're going to just play in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m19s)

[demo app and make this work so where is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m21s)

[the snack bar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m23s)

[so what we would really like to do here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m25s)

[let's do this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m29s)

[uh material design snack bar Reese uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m32s)

[uh oh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m37s)

[uh snack bar resources](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m40s)

[style target type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m46s)

[uh material](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m49s)

[nine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m52s)

[oh come on just snack bar message thank](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m54s)

[you uh based on static resource](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h58m58s)

[uh material design what the heck was](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m06s)

[oh this does this so this style does not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m08s)

[have a key it's implicitly typed so we](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m11s)

[can do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m13s)

[so that means our key is going to be a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m15s)

[curly brace X colon type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m19s)

[snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m22s)

[bar message boom that okay so uh worth](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m24s)

[noting for people who are unfamiliar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m29s)

[with Styles when you create a new style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m31s)

[oftentimes what I'll see happen is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m34s)

[people will make a style for something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m36s)

[in the material design library and then](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m38s)

[go wait I lost all the styling probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m39s)

[because you forgot you're based on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m42s)

[because when you apply a new style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m44s)

[inheritance is an automatic you you have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m47s)

[to opt into inheritance](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m50s)

[uh okay so Setter property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m52s)

[and then we want to go after that lovely](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m56s)

[little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=00h59m59s)

[Max something another](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m01s)

[content Max height this guy and you are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m04s)

[just a straight dependency property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m07s)

[so we'll just grab you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m09s)

[uh content Max site and I think so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m13s)

[there's a there's a a little trick here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m17s)

[so when you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m19s)

[um the default value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m22s)

[is you'll note this property here is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m24s)

[being applied to the max height property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m27s)

[of content presenter so if we go and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m29s)

[look at the max height property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m31s)

[uh this is not useful I need to actually](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m35s)

[see the Declaration](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m37s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m39s)

[let's go to what's the easiest way to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m42s)

[this uh source.net](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m45s)

[and we were inside of sorry uh framework](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m49s)

[element](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m53s)

[oh here here framework element](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m56s)

[Max height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h00m59s)

[yeah that one uh let's see uh but I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m03s)

[actually want the property declaration](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m06s)

[so the the important thing to note on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m10s)

[these ones is what the default value is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m12s)

[of the property because we effectively](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m15s)

[would like to unset this so that there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m17s)

[is no Max height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m19s)

[so for me when you look at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m21s)

[dependency property declaration that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m23s)

[typically where you're going to find the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m25s)

[defaults you can also do it at runtime](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m27s)

[if you do the property dot metadata](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m29s)

[because you can get access to this and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m32s)

[then see its default value that way as](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m34s)

[well so you can do it in the debugger if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m35s)

[you don't want to look it up this way](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m36s)

[but we can see double positive Infinity](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m38s)

[is what the default is so we're just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m40s)

[going to unset that or I should say](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m43s)

[we're going to put that value back in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m45s)

[so static uh duh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m48s)

[double](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m52s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m53s)

[uh oh I need to do what is this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h01m59s)

[double](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m06s)

[positive Infinity](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m07s)

[um this needs a I believe a namespace](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m12s)

[declaration added to it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m15s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m17s)

[let's see uh let's see XML namespace](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m20s)

[system](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m25s)

[CLR](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m27s)

[game Space](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m28s)

[system boom](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m32s)

[that should then resolve that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m34s)

[so static double positive Infinity](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m40s)

[F12 confirms that it resolves to the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m44s)

[right type so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m46s)

[probably good](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m50s)

[um we need to close that so that it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m51s)

[actually applies the setter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m54s)

[okay so here's the working Theory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m56s)

[working Theory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h02m58s)

[if we apply a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m00s)

[if we apply an implicit style and snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m05s)

[bar message we can override the style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m07s)

[being applied to the message to remove](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m09s)

[the maximum content type that's the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m11s)

[theory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m13s)

[uh let's see so question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m14s)

[uh in WPF with mvvm when passing data to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m16s)

[the view model even using dependency](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m20s)

[injection why do we propagate the object](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m21s)

[from the topmost color startup](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m27s)

[uh that violates the single](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m31s)

[responsibility principle and open close](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m33s)

[principles why don't we instantiate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m35s)

[directly in the needing view model in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m37s)

[the DI case we can use dependency lookup](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m39s)

[instead of dependency injection](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m42s)

[and we look up for the object we want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m45s)

[directly in the needing class](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m49s)

[the only drawback I can think of is The](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m52s)

[View Mall knows about the DI but I think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m54s)

[it is worth it oh that is a great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h03m57s)

[question uh let me Circle back to that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m00s)

[here in just a second](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m04s)

[and then I'm going to show you a library](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m06s)

[that I wrote](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m08s)

[because of that exact thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m10s)

[and it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m12s)

[I will I'm gonna before I show the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m15s)

[library I'm just going to put a word of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m16s)

[caution I I this library is used in a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m17s)

[production app](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m21s)

[and I'm only halfway okay with that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m24s)

[because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m27s)

[I've seen the other developers on the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m29s)

[team misuse the library so many times](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m31s)

[it just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m35s)

[uh it's one of those I I added great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m37s)

[power and didn't put enough guard rails](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m40s)

[around it and it so there's that okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m43s)

[we'll come back to that in just a second](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m47s)

[uh let's see line two line three](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m48s)

[line four](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m53s)

[send](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m55s)

[that did not override so let me let me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h04m57s)

[look at where that style is coming from](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m00s)

[real quick as Robert indicated once you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m02s)

[open up Snoop the fun begins](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m04s)

[or something to that effect](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m06s)

[we're going to do this we're going to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m09s)

[this and this one may be a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m10s)

[difficult to grab but we're going to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m12s)

[it real quick](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m13s)

[okay so there is snack bar and I know if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m15s)

[I do is active](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m18s)

[I can just force that sucker open okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m20s)

[it doesn't have the content anymore](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m23s)

[obviously but that is okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m24s)

[um and I would love to find the snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m28s)

[bar message and I want to look at its](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m31s)

[style and know where its style came from](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m33s)

[so style default](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m37s)

[so why did mine not get applied](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m42s)

[why did mine not get applied](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m53s)

[I would have expected an implicit style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m56s)

[source to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h05m59s)

[handled](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m02s)

[so we can see the style key that it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m03s)

[that it was using was based on its type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m06s)

[which is what our style is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m09s)

[well let me confirm let me let me just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m20s)

[confirm that I did what I think I did](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m22s)

[so example three](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m26s)

[move this up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m32s)

[well that shouldn't make a difference](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m35s)

[right like it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m37s)

[because it it knows it knows about this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m45s)

[style it's right here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m49s)

[and it knows it is keyed on the type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h06m58s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m02s)

[snack bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m09s)

[there a bug here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m17s)

[shouldn't be a bug right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m20s)

[this thing in cues nqs nqs does a bunch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m22s)

[of stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m26s)

[inserts clears start duration](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m31s)

[uh tell the spell checker to ignore that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m37s)

[show next](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m38s)

[fine snack bar show a sink](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m41s)

[this is what's triggering](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m45s)

[create and show](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h07m48s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m00s)

[this must be doing it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m06s)

[this creates the snack bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m08s)

[sets the message property sets the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m12s)

[active property and passes it up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m15s)

[so the short version is we can certainly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m23s)

[do it by overwriting that value](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m25s)

[but it is not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m28s)

[I'm not clear why this is not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m32s)

[resolving](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m37s)

[oh is it not resolving up the tree](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m39s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m47s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h08m58s)

[sorry one more one more test and then](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m00s)

[we'll go back to that other question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m02s)

[uh working Theory working Theory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m04s)

[um if I move this into app.xamlitresults](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m09s)

[that's the theory if I do that it works](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m16s)

[I bet](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m18s)

[what did I do why are you unhappy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m22s)

[oh this is another thing that bites](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m26s)

[people a lot uh don't uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m28s)

[oh uh I brought this in and did not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m33s)

[bring in my name space](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m36s)

[you figure it out for me no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m38s)

[you're not gonna be that cool okay fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m41s)

[I'll go go copy my name space](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m42s)

[uh I need](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m45s)

[you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m47s)

[and I need you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m49s)

[oh we've already got it it's just named](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m51s)

[system](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m53s)

[uh so the uh don't always trust your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h09m58s)

[airlift in Visual Studio your air list](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m02s)

[is often defaulted to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m04s)

[um build Plus intellisense](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m08s)

[which means the the xaml designer might](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m10s)

[be contributing heirs into here and the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m13s)

[xaml designer is really bad about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m15s)

[knowing the order of things so like one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m17s)

[air can propagate into like 50 things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m20s)

[so oftentimes what I prefer to do is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m23s)

[double check the output window to know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m26s)

[which of the heirs is actually the air](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m28s)

[triggering](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m30s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m33s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m36s)

[didn't resolve](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m42s)

[okay so we'll need to look at that okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m45s)

[but let's uh let's answer the question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m47s)

[on view model independency injection](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m49s)

[so uh uh do I have a good sample](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m51s)

[uh I don't think I do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h10m58s)

[but we can go and look at things so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m01s)

[uh CD Dev](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m06s)

[uh let's just go temp what's in here uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m10s)

[help them with preview mode](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m38s)

[okay so we'll go we'll go and take a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m40s)

[quick look at this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m42s)

[so I realized I just did a ton of things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m44s)

[very quickly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m47s)

[um if anybody is interested in what the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m48s)

[heck I just did with that template](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m52s)

[so if you like what you see you can find](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m58s)

[the.net new template that I'm using](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h11m59s)

[right there directions for install yada](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m01s)

[yada](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m04s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m05s)

[running the template we end up with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m07s)

[something uh like this so this is a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m10s)

[non-common way of setting up a WPF](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m15s)

[application but it does use the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m18s)

[um the I host or the generic host as](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m21s)

[you'll see it referenced a lot to set up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m24s)

[your di so I like this template because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m26s)

[it gives you a quick a quick uh wham bam](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m28s)

[slam into doing it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m32s)

[but the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m37s)

[but this I think somewhat starts to die](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m39s)

[dive in at the point of some of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m42s)

[problems with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m44s)

[um the structure so for example my my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m47s)

[main window here uh ends up taking in my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m49s)

[view model as a Constructor The View](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m53s)

[model itself ends up taking in uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m55s)

[currently nothing but it it could have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h12m59s)

[something like I'm Messenger right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m01s)

[just because we've got the the community](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m05s)

[tool kit added in we can do that kind of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m07s)

[thing some some sort of service](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m10s)

[right and so let me go back over this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m14s)

[question to make sure I got it right uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m15s)

[uh when passing to the view model even](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m18s)

[when using dependency ejection why do we](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m20s)

[propagate the object from the topmost](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m22s)

[caller](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m25s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m28s)

[so in the DI case we can use a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m35s)

[dependency lookup instead of dependency](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m37s)

[injection](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m39s)

[so I and I believe what you're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m41s)

[describing as dependency to look up I've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m43s)

[often heard referred to as the um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m45s)

[service locator pattern](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m48s)

[so if we take a look here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m54s)

[which I believe is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h13m57s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m02s)

[that's not there's a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m04s)

[there's a better example](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m08s)

[I've seen buried in the docks](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m16s)

[uh this is not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m20s)

[uh this is not quite what I am looking](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m24s)

[for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m27s)

[this is closer to what I'm doing not for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m31s)

[what I am looking to show](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m35s)

[um I've seen it a lot with like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m42s)

[older project templates because there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m44s)

[were for a while there was a couple of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m47s)

[project templates floating around that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m49s)

[really like the service locator pattern](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m50s)

[and it's to be clear it's not bad at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m52s)

[end of the day the most important](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m55s)

[feature of your app is shipping so uh uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h14m56s)

[you want to make sure that your app](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m02s)

[ships to clarify why don't we resolve](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m03s)

[the dependencies directly in the needing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m06s)

[class](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m07s)

[that is a good question and often so the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m09s)

[the generalized answer is that anything](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m11s)

[that you resolve inside of the class](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m15s)

[adds some amount of coupling between the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m19s)

[two classes and coupling isn't always](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m22s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m24s)

[right the the general guidance is you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m25s)

[want low coupling High cohesion](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m28s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m30s)

[it those are easy words to say and real](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m32s)

[life usually has other things to say](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m36s)

[about it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m37s)

[um so backing up for a quick moment the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m39s)

[one of the key Parts about doing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m42s)

[dependency injection](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m45s)

[um and not the only reason but one of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m48s)

[the big big reasons to to use dependency](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m49s)

[injection is so that there are nice](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m52s)

[seams in your code so that you can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m54s)

[um decouple your stuff do easy refactors](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m56s)

[write tests right the the whole point of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h15m59s)

[having those interfaces is to be able to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m03s)

[segment things apart](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m05s)

[however if you aren't writing tests you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m07s)

[lose a lot of the values](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m10s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m12s)

[um one of the key way so the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m13s)

[oftentimes what what ends up happening](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m17s)

[especially with view models are similar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m20s)

[that live for a long time is this list](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m22s)

[of Constructor parameters gets big](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m27s)

[and often what I prefer to use is a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m29s)

[factory pattern rather than directly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m32s)

[instantiate so for example](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m34s)

[um uh a common pattern that I run into](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m37s)

[is for example you've got your main](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m40s)

[window maybe your main window needs to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m42s)

[pop up a dialog to prompt the user to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m43s)

[log in right so you've got a a main](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m45s)

[window view model and a login view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m48s)

[your login view model has like username](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m50s)

[and password stuff on it uh maybe](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m52s)

[related relay commands or whatnot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m55s)

[um but your view model needs to show](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m58s)

[that dialogue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h16m59s)

[and it needs to instantiate a dialog](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m01s)

[viewmod](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m03s)

[right like at the end of the day you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m04s)

[know on your main window view model the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m07s)

[users performed an action like they've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m09s)

[they've clicked a button and you need to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m10s)

[instantiate that and bring it up so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m12s)

[there's there's a couple ways to go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m14s)

[around handling those types of cases the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m16s)

[factory pattern is probably my preferred](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m20s)

[approach in a lot of these cases because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m22s)

[adding multiple](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m25s)

[dependencies to your Constructor and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m28s)

[passing everything in gets to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m31s)

[unwieldy fast](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m33s)

[and oftentimes you'll find that you're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m35s)

[passing in parameters](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m37s)

[only so that you can pass them into](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m39s)

[something else further down the food](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m41s)

[chain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m43s)

[right like if I need to instantiate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m44s)

[let's let's make this a realist thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m46s)

[right so public class dialogue V model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m49s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m53s)

[and I do uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m54s)

[and this guy has an iMessenger right and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m56s)

[and we'll pretend like this guy is using](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h17m59s)

[the iMessenger but the only reason main](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m01s)

[window view model needs a messenger is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m04s)

[because down here he wants to go VAR you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m06s)

[know dialogue gets new dialog view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m08s)

[right but he can instantiate a view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m12s)

[model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m15s)

[without a messenger so now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m15s)

[main window view model needs to have a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m18s)

[messenger so that he can give it to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m20s)

[dialog view model to have a messenger](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m22s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m24s)

[and so and then round and so in order to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m26s)

[get so and then every time you do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m28s)

[right so we'll just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m30s)

[right we'll we'll populate this up so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m32s)

[that it actually compiles](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m34s)

[right and then heaven forbid you go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m37s)

[through and decide that you're going to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m38s)

[add](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m40s)

[what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m41s)

[oh so the fact that I can't spell is a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m46s)

[problem got it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m50s)

[all right okay fine go ahead make fun of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m54s)

[my spelling make fun of my spelling yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m57s)

[yeah yeah I get it I get it I can't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h18m58s)

[spell](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m02s)

[yeah just passing down the dependencies](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m04s)

[so the way I usually like to go about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m07s)

[doing it is I usually go back to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m10s)

[challenging the idea that main window](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m13s)

[view model needs to instantiate a dialog](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m16s)

[view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m18s)

[because typically what happens when you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m20s)

[see this type of pattern happening](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m22s)

[is main window view model doesn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m25s)

[actually need](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m28s)

[it it doesn't actually need to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m31s)

[instantiate a dialog view model it needs](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m33s)

[a dialog view model to do its work but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m35s)

[it doesn't actually need to instantiate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m37s)

[it it just needs the ability to create](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m39s)

[one it doesn't necessarily need](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m41s)

[um it doesn't necessarily need a the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m44s)

[dependencies for dialog viewmodel](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m47s)

[because this like you were saying 40](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m49s)

[plus parameters just to pass down that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m51s)

[gets incredibly messy right and I would](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m53s)

[I would strongly Advocate that the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m56s)

[actual dependency of main window view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h19m58s)

[model is actually more a a dialogue view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m00s)

[model Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m04s)

[so there's so there's a couple ways to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m06s)

[go about doing this I'm going to do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m08s)

[the Long Way first and then I'll show](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m11s)

[you the shorthand because the long way](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m12s)

[is easier right so public interface I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m13s)

[dialogue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m17s)

[Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m19s)

[right and then something like uh dialog](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m21s)

[V model create](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m25s)

[all right so we do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m27s)

[public class dialogue Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m29s)

[I dialog Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m33s)

[Implement interface and now this guy has](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m38s)

[to create the new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m40s)

[uh dialog view model and he needs a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m43s)

[messenger](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m46s)

[right so this is going to be a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m47s)

[subtle but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m49s)

[I think it'll get the point](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m51s)

[uh let's see messenger](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h20m58s)

[so now this guy really only needs an eye](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m02s)

[dialog Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m07s)

[and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m12s)

[catalog Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m15s)

[oh hush now hush now you're fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m17s)

[figured out oh thank you Auto code and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m20s)

[then down here this really just becomes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m23s)

[dialogue Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m26s)

[create](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m28s)

[right so this this allows this now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m31s)

[separates the idea of who actually needs](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m33s)

[to create the view model and now if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m37s)

[dialog view model gains dependencies](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m39s)

[the factory needs to to care about those](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m43s)

[dependencies](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m45s)

[but those dependencies then don't spiral](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m46s)

[up through your your object food chain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m49s)

[all the way up right it now it isolates](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m51s)

[the thing down the problem being is that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m54s)

[these types of one-liner factories get](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m57s)

[really bloody common](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h21m59s)

[so this is the kind of the generalized](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m01s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m03s)

[um and sometimes you even need to like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m04s)

[you want to have a situation where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m06s)

[you're like well I want to create I want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m08s)

[most of my parameters to come from di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m10s)

[but then I want to pass through like an](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m12s)

[extra string or some data object right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m15s)

[to that my view model needs for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m18s)

[initialization in those cases I like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m20s)

[writing real factories they're great](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m22s)

[they're awesome well great they're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m24s)

[awesome they're overhead let's be clear](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m26s)

[um but they they at least then separate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m28s)

[and can make](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m31s)

[um they give you a DI way of putting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m33s)

[yourself between the the Constructor](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m36s)

[and the thing that you're constructing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m40s)

[right so they're they're the way of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m42s)

[adding that interface because a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m43s)

[Constructor is a static call](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m45s)

[right people don't often think about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m48s)

[Constructors as being static methods but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m50s)

[that's all they are they are static](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m52s)

[methods](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m54s)

[so and static is uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h22m56s)

[tight coupling](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m00s)

[now the the cheater way to go about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m01s)

[doing this rather than an eye dialogue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m03s)

[Factory and I'll put this along the side](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m05s)

[is you do something like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m07s)

[and you leverage a funk](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m10s)

[all right so uh you do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m14s)

[and then this becomes you know VAR](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m17s)

[dialog 2 gets a dialog Factory two and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m19s)

[you can actually just do print friend or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m24s)

[if you want you can go full on invoke](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m25s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m29s)

[which sometimes you need to do if if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m30s)

[that's nullable you no propagation is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m32s)

[the thing in this case it's not nullable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m34s)

[whatever](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m36s)

[um and then what you do in your di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m38s)

[container and this is kind of getting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m39s)

[back to the suggestion that you had](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m42s)

[posted earlier](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m43s)

[um is you can actually do something like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m45s)

[services at Singleton](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m48s)

[bunk of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m52s)

[dialogue view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m55s)

[right and then this becomes let's see uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h23m58s)

[Services](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m03s)

[uh and we do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m04s)

[uh SVC dot get required service](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m09s)

[dialog view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m17s)

[rather than going through the effort and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m19s)

[I I realized I didn't actually register](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m22s)

[the other Factory so we'll we'll do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m24s)

[here real quick just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m26s)

[comparing Apples to Apples add Singleton](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m27s)

[uh I dialogue Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m31s)

[dialogue Factory right cool](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m35s)

[we'll make them both resolved](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m40s)

[for the simplistic case for the factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m42s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m45s)

[you can register up a funk in your di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m46s)

[container instead and typically you'll](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m48s)

[your funk will be registered as a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m51s)

[Singleton because you don't need](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m52s)

[multiple instances of the funk itself](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m54s)

[what's actually then interesting is you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m56s)

[can have your funk](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h24m58s)

[capture the service provider and maybe](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m00s)

[this is better just let's rename this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m04s)

[service](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m06s)

[provider effectively service provider in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m08s)

[this case is your di container right if](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m11s)

[you're using a different uh something](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m13s)

[other than the Microsoft dependency](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m15s)

[objection abstractions plug-in insert](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m17s)

[your service or your di container here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m19s)

[but you can have the funk reference your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m29s)

[your di container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m29s)

[and just call get required service back](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m32s)

[on that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m34s)

[the other thing you can do is your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m35s)

[factory if it really does need to do a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m38s)

[lot of dynamic stuff you could](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m40s)

[theoretically have this thing be I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m42s)

[service provider right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m47s)

[and and get it in there uh how to invoke](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m50s)

[this funk uh good question so so this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m53s)

[the registration so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m56s)

[three parts to that one you register the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h25m58s)

[funk in your di container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m01s)

[two you make the funk a dependency of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m04s)

[something resolved by your di container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m08s)

[in this case main window view model is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m10s)

[resolved by the DI container so it will](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m12s)

[see this type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m14s)

[right there's no interfaces here this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m16s)

[just straight up delegate types](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m18s)

[so but it will see a funk of a funk that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m21s)

[returns dialog view model and it'll](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m24s)

[shove it into this Factory and then down](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m26s)

[here you can actually take the funk and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m28s)

[just do two parens on the end of it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m31s)

[the other thing you can do rather than](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m33s)

[the two parens is call the invoke method](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m34s)

[Some people prefer that because it gives](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m38s)

[you an opportunity to use the null](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m41s)

[propagation operator or because it they](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m42s)

[find it to be more clear rather than](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m45s)

[just seeing two parents slapped on a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m46s)

[property going uh what that's that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m49s)

[weird yeah it works they both do the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m50s)

[same thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m53s)

[but then when you invoke this it's going](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m54s)

[to call back to that funk](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m57s)

[and create a new instance](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h26m59s)

[so worth noting though when you end up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m02s)

[doing it like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m05s)

[um the especially so depending on what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m08s)

[you put in this funk](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m11s)

[um oh yeah no problem Justin Bieber](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m14s)

[depending on what you put in this funk](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m16s)

[we've registered a Singleton Funk a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m18s)

[Singleton Factory that's effectively](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m20s)

[going to return](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m23s)

[probably transient because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m25s)

[we we haven't registered the dialogue](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m28s)

[view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m30s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m31s)

[in my hypothetical example I probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m33s)

[want uh dialogue view model as transient](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m36s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m40s)

[but again there's that separation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m42s)

[between what what should the lifetime be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m45s)

[and for very simple cases like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m49s)

[which I think this is the most common](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m51s)

[case I run into is I've got a view model](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m52s)

[it needs to instantiate another view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m55s)

[model I don't want to be passing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m56s)

[dependencies all the way from the top](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h27m58s)

[all the way down I want to break it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m00s)

[um and again it's it starts with the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m04s)

[idea of challenging](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m05s)

[does your view model actually need to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m08s)

[call new insert other type here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m10s)

[right there are cases where where maybe](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m14s)

[the factory pattern is not the right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m16s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m18s)

[um but I think the first question to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m20s)

[answer is should my class be calling the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m21s)

[Constructor of this other thing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m25s)

[that's that's the first question to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m28s)

[answer is should it be doing that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m30s)

[if the answer is well maybe not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m32s)

[then I think the factory pattern is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m36s)

[definitely worth looking at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m37s)

[now again there could be cases where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m39s)

[it's like no no I really need to be the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m41s)

[one calling new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m43s)

[it really needs to be done here for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m45s)

[whatever reason right if those are the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m47s)

[cases you might be stuck going through](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m49s)

[and doing this uh dialogue yeah new is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m52s)

[glue that is absolutely true okay now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h28m55s)

[for the promised bad solution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m00s)

[now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m03s)

[bear in mind the author of this library](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m04s)

[is telling you it's a bad solution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m07s)

[so lots of disclaimers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m11s)

[Auto Di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m13s)

[so anybody who wants to look at it feel](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m17s)

[free like I said it is in a production](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m18s)

[app I've I'm currently I keep poking at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m20s)

[it because it is set a little bit older](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m23s)

[um I think latest preview nugets have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m26s)

[support for net 7. um the old one works](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m28s)

[like there's nothing there's nothing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m32s)

[wrong with it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m34s)

[um so a couple things to be aware of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m36s)

[with this Library this Library does il](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m39s)

[weaving of your assemblies to do magic](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m42s)

[so just to be clear this thing is going](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m47s)

[to muck with the IL of your assembly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m49s)

[post compile to do magic](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m51s)

[okay now that we've got all the scary](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m55s)

[things out of the way uh where is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h29m57s)

[I think the quick start's probably good](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m01s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m02s)

[so what it allows you to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m04s)

[is it allows you to declare your classes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m07s)

[like this so my example class so this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m10s)

[would be the equivalent of like that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m13s)

[dialogue uh view model that we were](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m15s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m17s)

[and rather than having a hard dependency](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m18s)

[that's a parameter that you need to pass](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m21s)

[in you do something crazy where you use](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m23s)

[this Auto di dependency attribute and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m26s)

[you make](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m29s)

[you make the parameter optional](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m30s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m34s)

[and you'll note the very first line in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m35s)

[here checks that optional parameter for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m37s)

[null](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m40s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m42s)

[this then allows you to do oh I guess I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m43s)

[didn't show it here that's a little](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m47s)

[disappointing this this then allows you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m48s)

[to go new my example class not pass in a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m51s)

[parameter at the call site](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m55s)

[which will get a default of null](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h30m57s)

[but by the time you get to this line](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m00s)

[service will be populated for you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m02s)

[so what this library is doing is it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m05s)

[looks for this dependency attribute](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m09s)

[and somewhere between this closing paren](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m11s)

[and this opening curly brace it executes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m14s)

[some extra code that goes and looks this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m17s)

[up from your di container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m20s)

[yeah magic because believe me the number](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m23s)

[of people have been confused at this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m26s)

[library because it goes hang on somehow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m28s)

[this was null and then I got to my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m31s)

[opening curly brace and it wasn't null](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m33s)

[anymore it's like correct](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m35s)

[there's the magic](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m37s)

[uh again works by absolute magic it does](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m39s)

[il manipulation to make it all work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m43s)

[it also will do IL manipulation to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m46s)

[uh this is some scary Magic](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m49s)

[oh uh yeah so yeah I should warn people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m53s)

[there's the magic gets worse it gets it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h31m59s)

[gets really bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m02s)

[um it also has the ability to be to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m03s)

[used Straight Up on uh private](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m05s)

[properties private read-only properties](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m09s)

[because it's injecting code into the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m11s)

[Constructor to do the resolution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m13s)

[it has full access to that no problem](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m15s)

[away we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m18s)

[um and then it's able to you can then go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m20s)

[through and resolve things and make it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m23s)

[work it will also let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m25s)

[yeah so there's a bunch of configuration](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m31s)

[that can be set up on this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m34s)

[um the one of the other more interesting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m36s)

[ones that it will do is if you leave it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m38s)

[alone and just turn it loose](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m40s)

[it will go through and by default it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m43s)

[will generate all your di registrations](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m46s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m48s)

[so your setup case where you usually do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m49s)

[a bunch of registrations yeah you don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m52s)

[have to do those anymore it just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m54s)

[generates them all at compile time done](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h32m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m00s)

[yeah so it doesn't work for things so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m00s)

[you may still have to add additional](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m03s)

[registrations but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m05s)

[it may not be there it's also worth](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m07s)

[noting I first wrote this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m09s)

[I started writing this before the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m12s)

[Microsoft di abstractions came out and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m14s)

[by the time I got to a V1 release the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m17s)

[abstractions Library had come out so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m19s)

[there's a little bit of that but so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m22s)

[worth noting I started this before that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m24s)

[actually came out so some of the stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m26s)

[in here is because there at the time I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m27s)

[started writing this it was back when](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m30s)

[there was a bunch of debate about what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m32s)

[di container was best and you'd have the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m34s)

[flame Wars between Auto fact ninja Rhino](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m36s)

[whatever of people going crazy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m39s)

[um and I didn't like any of them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m43s)

[personally I think the Microsoft depends](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m44s)

[the objection abstractions has won like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m47s)

[you should use that if you want a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m49s)

[different di container backing it do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m51s)

[that but in general the Microsoft one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m53s)

[it's more or less won the DI Wars](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m55s)

[because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m57s)

[people pick Microsoft by default for no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h33m59s)

[other reason](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m03s)

[but if the generate the the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m04s)

[registrations if it sees an interface](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m07s)

[and sees a single implementing class](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m09s)

[registers the Singleton done if it sees](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m10s)

[a class it'll register that class to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m13s)

[itself I believe is either scoped or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m16s)

[transient I'd have to look at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m19s)

[defaults but there's there's a whole](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m20s)

[bunch of stuff in here so this is the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m22s)

[bad library of being able to do it now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m24s)

[the use case where this library is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m26s)

[actually really helpful specifically in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m29s)

[a WPF app](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m32s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m33s)

[um I built](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m36s)

[uh let's see sorry I wish I could hang](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m38s)

[around for the full stream glad I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m39s)

[finally got a chance to get part of them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m41s)

[I'll be looking in the chat from time to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m42s)

[time take it easy hey no problem mini 4G](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m44s)

[uh feel free the recordings also go up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m46s)

[on my YouTube as well if you want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m48s)

[catch them they they go up three or four](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m50s)

[days after they go out because twitch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m53s)

[has a thing about not posting content](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m55s)

[within like 72 hours or something like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h34m57s)

[that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m00s)

[um but they the the recordings to all do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m01s)

[eventually make it out or you can catch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m03s)

[them sooner on Twitch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m05s)

[um so this uh template that I put](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m08s)

[together for using the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m14s)

[the generic host for Di for registration](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m15s)

[works great this is this is like my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m18s)

[personal now people have opinions about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m22s)

[how to structure your app this is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m24s)

[Kevin's personal opinion of the best way](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m26s)

[to structure a WPF app](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m28s)

[feedback welcome](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m31s)

[um the the problem being with this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m33s)

[pattern because this does a great job of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m35s)

[being able to de-i inject your data](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m38s)

[context into your windows into your view](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m40s)

[Models All of That Jazz](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m43s)

[where this will fall apart is if you end](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m45s)

[up needing a a DI registered service in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m48s)

[say](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m52s)

[um a markup extension](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m54s)

[or a value converter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m56s)

[you no longer have an easy way of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h35m58s)

[reaching in and grabbing those](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m00s)

[right there is no easy static resolution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m03s)

[look the thing up because you kind of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m06s)

[want that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m08s)

[and because the framework doesn't give](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m10s)

[you those injection points because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m12s)

[remember WPF is old like it is a fairly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m13s)

[old framework trying to remember when it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m16s)

[came out 2003](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m18s)

[I think give or take so we're we're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m20s)

[coming up on two two decades](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m27s)

[because there's no easy way of doing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m29s)

[that auto di can be really really handy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m31s)

[the other thing that it does is it will](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m34s)

[only it will only replace your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m38s)

[dependencies](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m40s)

[if um if it sees a null value being](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m41s)

[passed in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m45s)

[so it makes for really easy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m46s)

[um unit testing because now if I want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m51s)

[test my example class I can pass in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m54s)

[any eye service mock or any other](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h36m58s)

[Auto di goes hands off and says no no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m02s)

[I'm not going to touch it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m05s)

[I'll only I'll only try to do di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m07s)

[resolution if I see a null value coming](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m09s)

[in there's no value coming in yeah I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m12s)

[going to try but if you give me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m14s)

[something else I'll go hands off so it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m16s)

[gives you a nice easy way to still](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m18s)

[inject because there is an if condition](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m21s)

[there I thought in one of my things I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m23s)

[had a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m25s)

[uh uh let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m27s)

[I may have broken some of this in some](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m31s)

[of my release notes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m33s)

[I was doing a bunch of stuff and I may](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m36s)

[have ended up breaking some of my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m38s)

[documentation I haven't touched this in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m40s)

[a couple months and I need to Circle](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m41s)

[back to it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m44s)

[because inside of it what it ends up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m45s)

[doing is if Services null register di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m47s)

[resolve otherwise use past an instance](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m51s)

[which is then how this ends up working](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m55s)

[it does mean if you have Noble reference](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h37m57s)

[types turned on you have to do null bang](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m00s)

[on the end of this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m02s)

[which looks weirder than all get out](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m03s)

[believe me like it's confusing and ugly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m05s)

[I do want to update this with some](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m09s)

[Source generator magic because it'd be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m11s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m13s)

[um but it also you can also do this on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m15s)

[local functions](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m18s)

[which gets real weird let me tell you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m20s)

[um You probably shouldn't do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m24s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m30s)

[that was a very long answer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m36s)

[let me know if that if that fully](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m39s)

[answered your question from earlier uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m41s)

[what is it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m46s)

[yeah great thing I did a project where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m48s)

[all classes resolved directly the object](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m50s)

[it needs from the DI service I wrap the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m53s)

[DI Service uh with a factory so I can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m54s)

[change in the future did I do a bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m57s)

[thing no that's not that's not horrible](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h38m59s)

[and I've seen people wrap up their di](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m02s)

[container in like a static class as well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m04s)

[because they need access to it for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m06s)

[different places](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m10s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m12s)

[I'll put it this way people who are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m14s)

[purists will probably say yes you did a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m16s)

[bad thing and you should have refactored](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m18s)

[your code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m20s)

[my opinion is if you shipped your app](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m21s)

[and it was able to to work appropriately](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m24s)

[you couldn't have been that far off](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m27s)

[shipping is the most important feature](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m30s)

[followed closely by shipping without](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m33s)

[bugs so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m35s)

[as long as you're able to continue to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m38s)

[iterate on the code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m41s)

[and mitigate bugs it can't be that bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m42s)

[right at the end of the day the simplest](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m47s)

[thing that gets the job done is probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m50s)

[good enough](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m53s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m55s)

[um I only put that little caveat on the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h39m57s)

[end is because one of the only things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m00s)

[that remains constant is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m02s)

[your your project is probably going to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m04s)

[need to change over time any project](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m06s)

[that's under active development and not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m08s)

[just like in archive bug fix mode](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m11s)

[it should be optimized for Change and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m13s)

[that's where a lot of the design](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m17s)

[patterns come into play is they try to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m18s)

[optimize for like encapsulation so that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m20s)

[you can when you need to add a new](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m23s)

[feature you change it in just that one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m25s)

[spot and it doesn't you know sprawl to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m27s)

[the entire application](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m33s)

[but no I don't I don't think you did it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m34s)

[uh about a bad thing at all and wrapping](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m36s)

[up the DI container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m39s)

[um in a little Factory](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m44s)

[is sort of the same thing that I'm that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m45s)

[I'm showing here right like this guy](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m48s)

[could take in an iservice provider](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m51s)

[and do the creates](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m54s)

[right that that's not that bad](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h40m56s)

[and like we've uh we've done this as](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m01s)

[well for like um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m04s)

[uh Json deserialization right if you're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m06s)

[using newtonsoft you can wire newtonsoft](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m09s)

[up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m12s)

[um so that you can serialize and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m13s)

[deserialize classes that go through your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m14s)

[di container](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m16s)

[that way if your class has a DI](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m17s)

[dependency newtonsoft can get can get](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m20s)

[that resolved that's a beautiful example](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m22s)

[of when you probably pass in a service](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m24s)

[provider because the I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m26s)

[remember the class inside of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m28s)

[newtonsoft.json library it's like a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m30s)

[resolver or similar but you can feed it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m32s)

[a custom uh creation delegate and you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m36s)

[can point that at a DI container and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m40s)

[it's effectively a factory pattern for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m42s)

[deserialization to be able to populate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m45s)

[it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m48s)

[hopefully that's all useful](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m49s)

[okay now to figure out why the heck my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m53s)

[snack bar isn't working](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m55s)

[because this didn't work either](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h41m57s)

[and I'm a little surprised](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m00s)

[I'm a little surprised](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m03s)

[because I sort of thought](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m06s)

[okay so here's what we're gonna do we're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m11s)

[gonna we're gonna we're gonna start](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m12s)

[playing around Setter property](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m13s)

[background value red right we're gonna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m15s)

[go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m19s)

[I'm gonna make this ugly for a moment](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m20s)

[and then we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m23s)

[because I want to confirm that I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m25s)

[actually getting what I expect value and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m30s)

[then obviously fuchsia because fuchsia](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m33s)

[is one of the ugliest colors you can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m35s)

[pick](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m37s)

[actually I'm making a good point second](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m38s)

[ugliest](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m40s)

[lime or I'm sorry no it's lime is the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m41s)

[one that's full green channel right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m45s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m47s)

[boom okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m50s)

[I have a feeling what I am about to see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m54s)

[is a lot of lime and not a lot of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m57s)

[fuchsia](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h42m59s)

[and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m03s)

[I'm a little confused by that because I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m04s)

[would have expected this snack bar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m06s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m08s)

[to look up it oh wait a minute](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m13s)

[that one didn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m16s)

[that one just disregarded](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m23s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m27s)

[that means the background property is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m30s)

[not being bound](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m34s)

[that means the yeah background isn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m50s)

[actually being set on any of these](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m54s)

[okay fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m57s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h43m59s)

[text so this is a perfect example of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m00s)

[what I was mentioning earlier right I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m03s)

[set the background property on the snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m06s)

[bar message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m08s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m10s)

[but if nothing inside of the template](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m12s)

[leverages this property this property is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m14s)

[effectively meaningless](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m17s)

[so yeah the snack bar itself is setting](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m20s)

[a background which is what is uh where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m24s)

[we're probably getting that lighter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m27s)

[color but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m28s)

[this guy no not a thing okay so we're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m31s)

[gonna use text element foreground](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m34s)

[because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m38s)

[that will get used because this this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m39s)

[property here I know inherits all the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m43s)

[way down to text elements and I know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m45s)

[we're going to get a a text element](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m48s)

[down there so we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m50s)

[then we're going to relaunch](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m53s)

[so that snack bar on the first screen](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h44m58s)

[I'm fully expecting its text to be lime](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m00s)

[and completely unreadable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m02s)

[that's the success case right now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m04s)

[ugly color and completely unreadable of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m08s)

[success](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m10s)

[fuchsia](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m11s)

[that means my local one has taken over](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m15s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m18s)

[seeing these ones down here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m22s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m25s)

[okay so this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m31s)

[this is working](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m33s)

[but it is still not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m36s)

[okay so I resolved but it didn't work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m39s)

[okay so now the next question can I put](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m42s)

[this back inside because I'd prefer to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m44s)

[put this inside my snack bar in my demo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m45s)

[app down here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m49s)

[example three](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m51s)

[here I want to put it here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m54s)

[right so I want it to only apply to this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h45m59s)

[one snack bar I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m01s)

[putting things at the app level always](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m02s)

[um oh yeah yeah right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m09s)

[doesn't work for everybody so I wanna I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m10s)

[just wanna make sure](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m13s)

[shrink you up designer I don't want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m14s)

[look at you right now](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m16s)

[I just want to make sure this works here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m18s)

[that one yeah lime is expected because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m20s)

[I'm no longer overriding it globally](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m23s)

[but I am overriding it here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m26s)

[my style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m32s)

[but when I set the property to positive](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m34s)

[Infinity it did not do what I expected](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m42s)

[let's figure out what the magical](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m43s)

[incantation is so this Ctrl shift so for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m46s)

[people who aren't familiar with this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m49s)

[this is the Snoop app if you just Google](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m51s)

[for Snoop WPF GitHub you will find the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m54s)

[GitHub repo for it and you can download](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m57s)

[uh the installer from their releases](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h46m59s)

[page it is wonderful it is awesome it is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m01s)

[in my opinion a required piece of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m04s)

[software for anyone doing WPF](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m06s)

[development](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m08s)

[with that said Microsoft has gotten a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m09s)

[little better with the visual studio](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m11s)

[like live visual tree and whatnot](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m12s)

[um I still the amount of stuff in Snoop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m15s)

[is just so much more](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m18s)

[uh okay so there's that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m22s)

[there's that so I have a snack bar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m25s)

[message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m27s)

[now I want to look at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m32s)

[content Max height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m35s)

[is still set to 36.](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m39s)

[uh show me foreground](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m43s)

[uh did you ever make any videos on Snoop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m50s)

[here or in on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m57s)

[you know I probably should so I've I've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h47m59s)

[done a few](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m01s)

[so there's there's content about Snoop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m04s)

[on several of my YouTube videos where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m06s)

[I've dived into how to use it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m08s)

[um So Pro tip](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m11s)

[if we go here we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m13s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m17s)

[GitHub](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m18s)

[don't scare me GitHub](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m26s)

[here's the here's the link to the repo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m28s)

[but so I I cheat and I keep](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m31s)

[um the subtitle tracks of all my YouTube](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m35s)

[videos in a GitHub repo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m38s)

[and these markdown files are hyperlinked](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m40s)

[back into the timestamp on the YouTube](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m42s)

[video](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m44s)

[and so you can technically come in here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m45s)

[and do things like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m46s)

[content about Snoop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m48s)

[and then find everywhere where I've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m52s)

[talked about Snoop but I don't know if I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m54s)

[I don't think I've made it a phrase I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m57s)

[know I haven't made any dedicated videos](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h48m59s)

[on Snoop and I probably should I've](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m01s)

[started to do some more short form](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m04s)

[content on YouTube](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m05s)

[so the baby](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m07s)

[a snoop video is almost certainly an](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m10s)

[order](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m12s)

[is almost certainly an order uh let's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m14s)

[see Cheeto vendor uh how long have you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m16s)

[been a Dev](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m18s)

[that is a great question](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m19s)

[gotta do math here real quick](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m26s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m29s)

[I think I got my first full-time job](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m33s)

[in two](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m38s)

[I think it's been close to well hang on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m42s)

[because I'm coming up on my 10-year](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m45s)

[anniversary with my current employer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m47s)

[I think that's this year](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m50s)

[and so it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m52s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m57s)

[young WPF video](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h49m57s)

[wants to be okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m00s)

[okay request submitted I will I will](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m02s)

[look at doing some Snoop specific videos](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m06s)

[um I think I've been a developer close](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m09s)

[to probably like 18 19 years](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m11s)

[is it been that long 16](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m15s)

[. wait how old am I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m18s)

[think I'm coming up on 16 years](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m27s)

[I think but math is hard and I don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m32s)

[know if I've had enough Mountain Dew yet](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m35s)

[tonight to do math and double digits](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m37s)

[I only got a math minor at University](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m41s)

[which means I can only count on one hand](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m43s)

[I'm not allowed to use the other hand](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m46s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m51s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h50m55s)

[a long time uh still in school](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m00s)

[so the one thing I will say for for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m06s)

[people still in school they there's this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m08s)

[idea in a lot of fields that the longer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m10s)

[somebody's doing it the better they are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m13s)

[um my my personal experience is that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m15s)

[um years of experience does not matter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m20s)

[that much in this industry](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m23s)

[it is a good starting point but I have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m25s)

[seen way too many developers that have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m28s)

[10 20 years experience that are that are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m30s)

[not much better than College grads right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m34s)

[that maybe only have a few years of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m36s)

[experience](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m38s)

[right so the because technology moves](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m40s)

[along so quickly people who don't learn](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m44s)

[quickly get left behind](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m48s)

[which uh from somebody new coming out of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m51s)

[school coming into the field that should](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m55s)

[be really encouraging because it means](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m56s)

[you don't have you don't have to work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h51m58s)

[for 20 30 years to try to get yourself](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m00s)

[on the level of you know where all the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m02s)

[seniors are at right the technology](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m03s)

[moves really quick so it's actually not](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m05s)

[that uncommon to see people who are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m08s)

[fairly young doing moving up fairly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m09s)

[quickly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m13s)

[um especially those who like learning](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m15s)

[like the ones who enjoyed learning and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m17s)

[dive into stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m19s)

[can jump ahead really quick uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m21s)

[oh you're a real dungeon master](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m24s)

[programmer uh so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m26s)

[so for all the newbies out there coming](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m29s)

[into it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m31s)

[um just know that you you may not have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m32s)

[as far to go to catch up to other](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m36s)

[developers as you might think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m37s)

[now there's there's some skills that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m39s)

[that are that are a little more Timeless](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m43s)

[right things like uh networking](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m46s)

[knowledge right tcpip hasn't changed in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m49s)

[decades like people who understand](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m52s)

[networking Concepts](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m54s)

[they they could have learned them back](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m56s)

[in the 80s and it's still applicable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h52m58s)

[today right there's not there's not a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m00s)

[lot of change that has occurred in there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m02s)

[like some things move really slow things](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m04s)

[like uh basic design patterns and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m06s)

[architecture a lot of that has held](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m08s)

[pretty steady there's some newer stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m11s)

[that that evolves over time especially](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m13s)

[as newer language features come out like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m16s)

[the way people used to optimize NCC code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m18s)

[where you know you order all your](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m21s)

[parameters or all your locals at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m23s)

[beginning of your method don't don't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m25s)

[combine your declaration assignment yeah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m26s)

[that's not really relevant in some newer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m29s)

[languages right the compiler handles](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m31s)

[that stuff for you like compilers have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m33s)

[advanced and gotten smarter the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m35s)

[programmer does a little bit less work](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m39s)

[oh Bruce](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m41s)

[um so just be aware of that that with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m46s)

[with some advances some things are still](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m50s)

[relevant some things aren't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m52s)

[but especially things like learning](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m54s)

[newer Frameworks](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m56s)

[like it's it it can be very easy for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h53m59s)

[people who are senior developers to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h54m02s)

[completely ignorant of newer stuff I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h54m05s)

[don't know everything I enjoyed learning](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h54m07s)

[on a constant basis but sometimes people](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h54m09s)

[throw curveballs at me and go hey have](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h54m12s)

[we're going to rework it the problem is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m04s)

[is the code he sent me is from a clients](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m06s)

[repo and I obviously can't share that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m08s)

[but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m10s)

[um I'm going to do up uh an open source](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m12s)

[sample that demonstrates a similar](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m16s)

[problem and post it because it it was a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m17s)

[explain it back to you Justin Bieber I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m53s)

[not sure](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m55s)

[the question there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m57s)

[specifically around your display name](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h58m59s)

[attribute if you want to clarify uh okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m01s)

[to go here I want to do this I want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m07s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m09s)

[I want to do this and I want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m10s)

[manipulate some properties until I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m13s)

[figure out why this thing isn't sizing](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m15s)

[the way I expect](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m16s)

[okay so there there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m18s)

[if I go to the snack bar message I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m21s)

[should see a Max](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m23s)

[height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m26s)

[okay so some so my Max height is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m27s)

[currently set](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m30s)

[to infinite](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m31s)

[so I shouldn't be limited there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m33s)

[let me just dive in and make sure](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m38s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m41s)

[there might be a Max height here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m48s)

[uh if I just do thousand is probably big](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m53s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m55s)

[so that interesting well Max height is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=01h59m58s)

[bound hang on hang on hang on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h00m02s)

[campaign I always have to be careful](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h00m55s)

[what I say on stream because I know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h00m57s)

[occasionally James who is one of the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h00m59s)

[players will drop in and Snoop](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m01s)

[and with my luck he'll drop in at the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m04s)

[exact wrong or right time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m06s)

[uh okay so this Max height binding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m08s)

[still landing on it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m13s)

[oh oh oh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m19s)

[this okay okay okay I misread my binding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m22s)

[ultimate meta gaming okay okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m26s)

[so I misread this content presenter](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m31s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m33s)

[this is not binding uh to the the snack](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m34s)

[bar message itself I misread that that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m40s)

[says snack bar which is different](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m43s)

[which is different so this actually](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m47s)

[becomes much easier muchas easier well](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m49s)

[just easier no no no thinking no think](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m53s)

[we come up here and we go here and we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h01m59s)

[and we go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m00s)

[uh let's see so I have to name space](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m04s)

[resolve there I do that and then I take](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m09s)

[this little positive infinity guy and I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m12s)

[go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m14s)

[and I paste it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m16s)

[okay and then this whole thing becomes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m19s)

[kind of meaningless but we're gonna](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m21s)

[leave it for the minute because fuchsia](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m23s)

[everyone loves fuchsia or at least](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m26s)

[I love fuchsia so we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m28s)

[um that is a joke for any UI designers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m33s)

[who are about to throw things at me](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m35s)

[I use fuchsia uh so I actually there's a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m38s)

[designer I work with uh during my day](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m41s)

[job and I I made the comment one day I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m43s)

[like don't worry I intentionally made](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m46s)

[the icon fuchsia because I knew it was](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m47s)

[ugly enough that you wouldn't leave it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m50s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m51s)

[once the Laughing died down they they](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m54s)

[told me they'd get me a design](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h02m56s)

[okay so I go here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m00s)

[go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m03s)

[so the solution's simple the solution](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m06s)

[simple you set the following attached](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m08s)

[property on your snack bar and it will](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m11s)

[increase your maximum height to infinite](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m13s)

[and you can control however you want wow](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m17s)

[okay if I had if I've been able to read](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m20s)

[my own code earlier we could have saved](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m23s)

[a lot of time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m24s)

[reading is hard](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m27s)

[reading is hard](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m33s)

[okay so let's let's go post a reply to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m35s)

[this and then we'll jump back to the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m38s)

[brain teaser and then I may](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m39s)

[call it for the evening](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m41s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m43s)

[uh there is an attached uh property that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m46s)

[you can set on the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m52s)

[snack bar instance itself to control the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h03m55s)

[maximum](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m02s)

[height of the messages](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m04s)

[um if you want to allow for any height](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m09s)

[you can set it to double dot positive](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m15s)

[Infinity](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m23s)

[something like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m25s)

[okay I will say so I was working on some](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m28s)

[brain teasers earlier tonight and I had](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m31s)

[GitHub co-pilot running](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m34s)

[and not only did it solve the brain](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m36s)

[teaser by looking at my commented code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m40s)

[but it finished typing the explanation](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m43s)

[of how it was working and I went dear](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m46s)

[Heavens co-pilot you suck](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m48s)

[um you spoil the ending for everything](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m52s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h04m58s)

[yeah sometimes it's very difficult](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m02s)

[that's actually a comment I've received](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m04s)

[multiple times Justin Bieber about](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m06s)

[attached properties is it's you never](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m08s)

[know where or which ones are available](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m10s)

[when and the short answer is every](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m12s)

[attached property is available](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m16s)

[everywhere and small asterisk next to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m17s)

[that because they can be scoped down to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m21s)

[only certain they they only can be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m22s)

[applied to buttons or similar but in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m24s)

[general you can apply any of them](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m26s)

[anywhere](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m28s)

[um like uh this one](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m30s)

[right like for example I can come down](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m33s)

[here and go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m35s)

[grid dot row which is an attached](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m37s)

[property and I can set it to two](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m39s)

[it's going to have Zero Effect because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m41s)

[I'm not inside of a grid](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m43s)

[and so people have asked for a list of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m46s)

[which attached properties are usable](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m49s)

[where](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m51s)

[um because attached properties in](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m53s)

[general don't have Behavior associated](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m55s)

[with them now that's not always true](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m57s)

[some attached properties when you set](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h05m59s)

[them they have like on property change](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m01s)

[things that trigger and will do stuff](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m03s)

[but most of the time you set an attached](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m05s)

[property and it's just it's values that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m07s)

[are there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m10s)

[um the hard part with it is because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m12s)

[attached properties can also inherit up](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m13s)

[or inherit down the tree](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m16s)

[sometimes an attached property may be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m18s)

[available but it's somewhat difficult to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m21s)

[show I have hopes of being able to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m23s)

[generate documentation about at least](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m25s)

[the material design attached properties](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m28s)

[of which ones are used inside of which](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m30s)

[Styles and templates because that I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m33s)

[think I can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m35s)

[programmatically figure out](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m36s)

[within reason like some some are are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m40s)

[going to be harder to figure out than](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m43s)

[others but most of the time I can scan](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m44s)

[through a style or a template and tell](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m47s)

[you which attached properties are](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m49s)

[consumed by that style or template and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m51s)

[then obviously there's a hierarchy there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m53s)

[where it may go up or down](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m55s)

[um because they're I would love to be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h06m58s)

[able to list out alongside of every](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m00s)

[style in the library which attached](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m04s)

[properties are used inside of that style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m06s)

[and ideally you have those docs Auto](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m08s)

[generated so that as they change it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m10s)

[automatically puts it up it's not a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m12s)

[perfect solution but I think it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m14s)

[probably the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m16s)

[the easiest one to do](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m18s)

[uh let's see so I want to do at least](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m22s)

[for the sample code](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m24s)

[I want to do something like this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m27s)

[because I think that would go a long way](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m30s)

[at least helping people within this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m32s)

[library because I can't list what every](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m33s)

[every property that might be relevant](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m37s)

[because I don't know what might be](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m39s)

[relevant but I could at least list given](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m41s)

[a material design Style](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m44s)

[what](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m48s)

[what it where it where is it being](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m49s)

[consumed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m51s)

[okay so we'll do that there's an answer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m55s)

[there hopefully that one's helpful](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h07m57s)

[um and away we go and if there's any](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m03s)

[questions on why the snack bar is set](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m05s)

[there](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m07s)

[it is a little weird that we I get why](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m09s)

[we defaulted it to two lines because I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m12s)

[remember there was a lot of debate when](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m13s)

[we added in the functionality where is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m15s)

[it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m17s)

[for the action button to move down](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m18s)

[because there's there's actually a bit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m23s)

[of code where is it where is it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m25s)

[we saw it earlier](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m28s)

[yeah there there's actually quite a bit](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m33s)

[of code to go from this two-line message](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m35s)

[to this two-line message with longer](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m37s)

[action text](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m40s)

[and so there's a it gets weird like it's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m42s)

[it's hard to know exactly the correct](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m46s)

[size in all cases so that's why we put](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m48s)

[the attached property so that it could](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m51s)

[be can](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m53s)

[the caller can then control it because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m54s)

[I don't know what people want](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h08m59s)

[brain teaser time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m00s)

[uh brain teasers so we were looking at](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m03s)

[the long class names so if we go here](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m05s)

[so this is the brain teaser uh for this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m11s)

[evening](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m15s)

[um it is out on the repo Link in the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m16s)

[chat for anybody who does it um when I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m18s)

[had initially posted this to my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m21s)

[colleagues](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m22s)

[um I had a single solution in mind](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m23s)

[um and one of my colleagues came back](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m26s)

[with another solution that I hadn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m27s)

[considered](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m29s)

[so the the answer here there's actually](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m30s)

[two answers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m32s)

[so just to clarify the the hard part](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m34s)

[here is the the goal is to declare a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m37s)

[class so you know public class Foo](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m39s)

[right](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m43s)

[but declare the class such that when you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m45s)

[do type of name the length of that name](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m48s)

[is greater than 42 characters](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m51s)

[now this is obviously somewhat](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m54s)

[challenging because type of Foo still](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m55s)

[has to resolve to the class right you](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h09m58s)

[can't just do you know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m00s)

[really long name because that doesn't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m02s)

[work as Foo anymore](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m05s)

[so that's that's the brain teaser to go](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m07s)

[through and think on](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m10s)

[so anybody who doesn't want spoilers](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m12s)

[you've got about five seconds to pause](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m14s)

[the video before I show the solutions](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m16s)

[three two one okay so solution one and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m21s)

[this was this was actually the one that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m25s)

[I had initially come up with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m28s)

[um when I wrote the brain teaser so uh](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m30s)

[Solution One requires C sharp 11 or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m34s)

[later specifically what we are looking](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m36s)

[for is file scoped classes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m38s)

[so when you put the file access modifier](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m41s)

[onto a uh class it makes the class only](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m45s)

[available within this file](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m50s)

[this is different than every other](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m52s)

[c-sharp modifier that has come before](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m54s)

[we've never had anything that is scoped](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m56s)

[based upon individual files](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h10m58s)

[uh the primary use case for this is like](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m01s)

[Source generators that want to generate](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m03s)

[classes but they don't want those](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m05s)

[classes that they generate exposed](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m06s)

[outside of that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m08s)

[what the compiler ends up doing is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m10s)

[hashing the contents of this class and](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m12s)

[slapping on a really massive hash onto](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m14s)

[the end of this thing so if we run this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m17s)

[test](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m20s)

[doc](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m22s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m23s)

[all right let me just put you off the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m25s)

[side you can see test passes huzzah](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m27s)

[because of that very long hash that goes](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m29s)

[on the end of the name which again is](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m33s)

[only there because even though you may](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m34s)

[say file scope thing the compiler has to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m37s)

[enforce it but at the end of the day](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m39s)

[when the app is running there still has](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m41s)

[to be a class there that works so the](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m43s)

[compiler just enforces that no one else](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m46s)

[gets at that but in theory if you wanted](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m48s)

[to get this class outside of this file](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m50s)

[you can do it via reflection](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m52s)

[like reflection is basically the take](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m56s)

[take all the training wheels off we're](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h11m59s)

[gonna ride anyway](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m01s)

[so if you want to do it that way so but](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m02s)

[again require C sharp 11 or later](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m05s)

[because you need the file scope types](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m07s)

[prior to C sharp 11 or later you can't](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m09s)

[gain access to it there's that](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m11s)

[solution two which I had not considered](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m14s)

[when I first wrote this came from a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m16s)

[colleague of mine](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m18s)

[um you can do it by declaring the type](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m21s)

[thusly](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m24s)

[I think that's word we're going to use](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m27s)

[it and then aliasing the type name so](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m28s)

[using a using directive you can Alias a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m32s)

[type and most people are familiar with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m36s)

[this because if you've got two types](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m38s)

[with the same class name and you need to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m40s)

[bring in both of their namespaces with](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m43s)

[using statements you have to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m45s)

[disambiguate which one you intend to use](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m46s)

[by doing this but you can also use this](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m48s)

[to Alias it like I've I've done this for](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m51s)

[types straight up where maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m55s)

[referencing a library where they've got](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m57s)

[a class that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h12m59s)

[that was weird](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m00s)

[um where they they've got a class that's](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m02s)

[maybe has a really common name like I](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m05s)

[don't know object or packet or stream or](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m08s)

[something something that is often used](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m11s)

[in more than one place and I want to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m13s)

[disambiguate it and so I'll say well no](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m15s)

[no this isn't a packet this is you know](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m17s)

[Library packet that way I can give it a](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m20s)

[name that I want to use inside of my](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m23s)

[file](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m25s)

[um but then the compiler is still hip to](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m26s)

[it so by doing this by giving it a long](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m28s)

[name type of still resolves food because](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m31s)

[that's the Alias here but at run time](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m35s)

[when it goes and grabs the name of it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m37s)

[it's actually going to get the name of](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m39s)

[the class which is going to be Foo lots](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m40s)

[of numbers following it](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m43s)

[and once again we'll run the test just](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m45s)

[to prove](https://youtu.be/1tTSDjxf8sQ?t=02h13m47s)
