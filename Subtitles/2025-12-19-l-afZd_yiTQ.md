[Hello everyone. Welcome back. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m02s)

[sorry. I'm I got a new toy over this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m04s)

[last week. It is a knockoff brand Steam](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m06s)

[Deck, but one where I was able to write](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m09s)

[my own plugins for it. And so I am](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m11s)

[struggling but having fun and I've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m14s)

[new fancy buttons to press to like make](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m17s)

[stuff happen. So if things go haywire,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m19s)

[I'm sorry. I'm practicing. I'm learning.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m22s)

[We're working on it. So it's fun though.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m24s)

[I I like any device I can write code](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m26s)

[for. So, welcome everyone. Uh, we are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m28s)

[going to do something a little bit](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m31s)

[different. Well, little bit of the same,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m33s)

[a little bit different. So, I have been](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m35s)

[doing a lot of AI related stuff. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m36s)

[this last week, just a quick story time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m40s)

[Uh, Tuesday was a 19-hour day for me. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m42s)

[was up at 4:30 and finally got home at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m45s)

[11:30 that night. It was a really,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m47s)

[really long day. Uh, which was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m51s)

[exhausting, but it but it was good. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m55s)

[was doing a bunch of um GitHub copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m57s)

[training as part of my job. Um and some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h00m59s)

[of the I guess prep work kind of led](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m02s)

[into some ideas. Yeah, only 19 hours. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m05s)

[know Izzy, a pitiful. I didn't even get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m07s)

[a two in the in the tens digit. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m10s)

[complete chump work. But you know what?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m13s)

[For me, that was a lot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m14s)

[U but kind of some of this prep with it,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m17s)

[it got me thinking of some of things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m19s)

[that I want from the material design](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m21s)

[library and how I could improve it. it a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m23s)

[little bit more. So, we're going to take](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m26s)

[some runs at this and we're going to see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m28s)

[how it goes. And I was going to play](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m30s)

[around a little bit. So, last time we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m32s)

[worked on that tab control PR of trying](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m34s)

[to deal with kind of the animation](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m37s)

[stuff. Uh Nikolai took it, ran with it,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m39s)

[knocked it out of the park. There's an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m42s)

[awesome PR out there. Um there still](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m44s)

[kind of a work in progress. There was a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m47s)

[couple issues um that Corins, the other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m48s)

[maintainer, found with it. Um uh Nikolai](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m50s)

[messaged me and said that he put them on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m53s)

[the description of the PR. So, we'll](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m55s)

[probably take a look at that. But one of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m56s)

[the things that went along with that was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m57s)

[the idea of how to write some UI tests](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h01m59s)

[for it. And we've got the ZAML test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m01s)

[library, but oftentimes I find those are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m02s)

[a little difficult to get right. And it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m05s)

[got me thinking, I bet you I could do an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m07s)

[MCP server for my ZAML test library to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m10s)

[make that stupid easy. So, that's that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m14s)

[the crazy idea in my head. And so,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m18s)

[tonight we may try to make that crazy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m20s)

[idea real. So here here here's the game](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m22s)

[plan. But first quick announcement. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m25s)

[so there is I Yeah. So I think I'm done.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m45s)

[Uh, sorry, getting messaged about said](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h02m49s)

[this is free for online attendees, so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m05s)

[feel free to jump in that if, uh, people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m08s)

[are interested. Um, the other event that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m11s)

[I wanted to plug,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m14s)

[Yeah, we're going to look at my calendar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m27s)

[here in a moment and and see because I I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m29s)

[may have to flux some things around a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m31s)

[little bit. But, um, the Gitcon was this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m33s)

[last week. I thoroughly enjoyed it. For](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m37s)

[people who are unaware, the sessions are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m40s)

[pre-recorded. So, if anybody watched it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m42s)

[live and you were kind of curious why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m44s)

[like chat questions weren't being](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m45s)

[answered, it was one of those kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m47s)

[weird things where I don't I think their](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m49s)

[marketing team wanted it to feel like it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m51s)

[was a potentially a live event, but it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m52s)

[wasn't like it was things were](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m54s)

[pre-recorded and day two had some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m56s)

[technical difficulties, but the good](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h03m58s)

[news is Oh, that is Hang on. That's the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m00s)

[wrong link. I grabbed the wrong one. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m03s)

[where is the Oh, did I not I didn't post](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m08s)

[it in in the events. Hang on one second.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m11s)

[I will grab it. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m13s)

[uh, sorry. Uh, Git Kraken did go through](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m18s)

[and post it out the the recordings out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m22s)

[because day two they had technical](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m24s)

[difficulties getting them to start. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m26s)

[and then um issues with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m33s)

[uh right at the end as well. Um and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m35s)

[hang on one second because I've got it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m39s)

[queued up right because selfishly I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m41s)

[think my session was the best. And so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m44s)

[I was going to cue this right into it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m48s)

[So yeah, somewhere about here. So copy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m51s)

[video at current time. There we are.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m54s)

[Boom. There we are. So, there's the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m56s)

[YouTube video for the Gitcon day one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h04m58s)

[It's queued up um for my session.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m02s)

[Personally, I think there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m04s)

[sessions on there that are very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m06s)

[worthwhile watching. Um so, if you are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m07s)

[interested, I think that would be great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m11s)

[Um let's see here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m14s)

[I think that's it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m18s)

[All right. One moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m25s)

[Um, I apologize. I have a child up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m28s)

[We'll be right back in just a moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h05m32s)

[Okay, sorry about that. Of course, the I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m02s)

[finally get stuff set up and I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m04s)

[have a a BRB slide ready to go. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m06s)

[small bit GitCon really great. Day two](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m09s)

[live stream had some issues, but the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m13s)

[recording is full and complete. Um, day](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m15s)

[one is a little more focused on the dev](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m18s)

[side. Day two is a little bit for maybe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m20s)

[on the the managerial side. Um but lots](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m22s)

[of great content in my opinion. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m25s)

[watched both of them in full. Loved](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m27s)

[every minute of it. Very worthwhile](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m29s)

[going through and doing. Okay. Netcom](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m31s)

[Gitcon,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m34s)

[right? And then Izzy had the audacity to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m36s)

[ask about Christmas. So, there is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m39s)

[follow the my my Discord if you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m43s)

[interested, but there is a very good](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m46s)

[chance that next week's stream is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m48s)

[cancelled andor postponed. I may try to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m50s)

[push it onto a Friday instead so I'm not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m52s)

[streaming on Christmas. Um, but there I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m53s)

[I am probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m56s)

[uh busier beyond all belief that day.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h09m59s)

[We've got extra family in town. It's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m01s)

[going to be great, but it's also going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m03s)

[to be completely chaotic. So, just as a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m05s)

[word of caution, follow the Discord.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m09s)

[I've been trying to post at least in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m11s)

[streaming chat when I'm uh cancing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m13s)

[things so that people have an idea. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m17s)

[if you want to know uh if there's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m19s)

[scheduling change, I've been trying to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m21s)

[put it in there as soon as I can confirm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m22s)

[what my plans are. Unfortunately, I will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m24s)

[probably not know these plans until](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m26s)

[Monday, Tuesday at the soonest. And so,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m27s)

[we'll see. We'll see how family stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m30s)

[goes. Okay, there's all of that material](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m31s)

[design here. Here we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m34s)

[Um, okay. Why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m37s)

[Why did this one crash and die?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m40s)

[Oh, probably because this thing's not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m44s)

[allowed to. Yeah, it doesn't have the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m45s)

[workflow permission. Um, I am going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m47s)

[just squash merge that because that one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m51s)

[should have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m52s)

[the by default GitHub actions aren't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m55s)

[allowed to update themselves unless you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h10m58s)

[explicitly give them that permission.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m00s)

[And it's sometimes I'll give it to them,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m02s)

[sometimes I won't. It's a little bit of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m04s)

[uh um back and forth. Um let me see if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m06s)

[Corfin's replied to the comment on this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m09s)

[one. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m11s)

[oh yeah, so leverage clip to bounds](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m15s)

[instead of custom converter. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m17s)

[This is perfect. Approve. Submit review.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m20s)

[I did I must have missed the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m24s)

[notification when this came through.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m25s)

[This is the other problem I have right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m26s)

[now is I get so many GitHub](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m27s)

[notifications. Working on fixing that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m29s)

[too. Um, okay. But this is perfect](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m31s)

[because that basically matches exactly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m34s)

[what I expected. And then let's throw](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m36s)

[this in the milestone.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m38s)

[And I want to make sure I get the linked](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m40s)

[issue in the milestone as well. So it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m42s)

[goes through. See, we don't need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m44s)

[evaluation required if there's an open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m46s)

[PR for it. And then this goes here. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m48s)

[this kind of work is something that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m51s)

[want to try to automate, too. like when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m53s)

[I move a PR into uh a milestone, if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m54s)

[there's a linked issue, I would kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m58s)

[like that to trigger as well. So, we may](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h11m59s)

[we may try to build build that out.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m03s)

[Okay, so last time we looked at the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m05s)

[tab control bit and then Nikolai went to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m09s)

[park, which was great. Um, so for those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m14s)

[people who who don't remember, the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m18s)

[material design spec has this extra](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m20s)

[padding kind of around the tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m23s)

[um for for being able to do it. Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m27s)

[see the big question. Will there be a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m30s)

[release before the 12th of January? I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m31s)

[don't think so. Only because I I have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m33s)

[not asking for a friend. Uhhuh. Yes,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m38s)

[Izzy. I'm aware. Um, I don't think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m40s)

[before the 12th of January, like I will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m43s)

[cut a quick release if some bug comes up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m45s)

[that's like a big issue, but I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m48s)

[nothing in the milestone so far has been](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m52s)

[the get a release out right away. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m54s)

[actually, let me double check because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m57s)

[didn't hear back.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h12m59s)

[Normally the owner of the library will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m01s)

[message me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m04s)

[when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m10s)

[yeah he forgot to update the pat. So I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m14s)

[actually can't even publish Nougat](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m17s)

[packages right now. So that's a problem.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m18s)

[So he said he was going to do it last](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m21s)

[Wednesday. It's uh or I guess Wednesday](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m23s)

[would be yesterday. So see how that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m26s)

[goes. Uh, okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m30s)

[Uh, let's see. Done.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m34s)

[Close that. Go back there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m37s)

[And sorry, I'm just checking one thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m41s)

[to make sure.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m43s)

[Oh, yeah. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m45s)

[boom boom. But I am ready now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m49s)

[Make me scroll. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m57s)

[making me scroll.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h13m59s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m05s)

[boom.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m10s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m12s)

[Oh, thank you, Izzy. I appreciate it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m16s)

[You were quicker on the draw than I was.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m18s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m20s)

[okay. So, I need to follow up on that,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m24s)

[but there was a couple issues down here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m26s)

[that, um, Corvin's found on this. Um but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m28s)

[the basic idea and there was some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m32s)

[testing about you know what happens if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m34s)

[you uh have a mouse where the scroll](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m37s)

[wheel can be tilted side to side to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m40s)

[able to go through and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m42s)

[uh do some kind of horizontal scrolling](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m44s)

[which is great. And in my testing it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m48s)

[works the same as if you were to click](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m51s)

[on the little arrows on a scroll bar.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m53s)

[Like normally those arrows are hidden](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m55s)

[and like we intentionally hide them on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h14m58s)

[the the scroll viewer for the tabs. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m00s)

[but in this case when you use it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m04s)

[sideways it does let you get a tab kind](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m06s)

[of perfectly on that kind of horizon](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m08s)

[line because that's the idea is when you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m10s)

[tap on a tab we want the selected tab to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m12s)

[move in plus the extra um space on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m14s)

[edge. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m19s)

[so there is that. Um, and then I left a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m23s)

[couple of UI tests. They don't curly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m26s)

[assert anything there. Feel free to have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m28s)

[a stab at them if you wish. If not, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m29s)

[will get around to it eventually. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m31s)

[this is where this is where I was like,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m33s)

[you know what? It would be really cool](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m35s)

[if building out these UI tests wasn't a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m38s)

[pain in the butt.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m41s)

[So, that's the goal is I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m44s)

[I kind of want to do it on on this PR to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m47s)

[help Nikolai. And and part of me is like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m49s)

[I kind of want to do this because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m51s)

[think it'd be fun, too. though. There is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m52s)

[there is a bit of that and there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h15m58s)

[let's see here. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m00s)

[won't that name be a little too generic?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m04s)

[Tab header padding.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m06s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m09s)

[I might have to go back in and look at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m14s)

[this cuz I thought this these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m16s)

[were on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m19s)

[too generic.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m24s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m26s)

[yeah, I don't think I was intending this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m31s)

[to be on the attached property, but on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m33s)

[the nested class. So maybe we'll pull](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m36s)

[it. Let's train our binary overlords.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m39s)

[Judgment day is coming. Well, so here's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m41s)

[the scary part is I want the MCP on my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m43s)

[ZAML test library, which means I'm going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m45s)

[to give Copilot control of my keyboard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m47s)

[and mouse.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m49s)

[So just to be clear, if the stream](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m52s)

[suddenly ends, it means co-pilot has](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m54s)

[done something very, very bad.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h16m57s)

[And hopefully that doesn't happen. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m01s)

[uh, let's see. There's that. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m06s)

[fine.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m08s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m10s)

[I'm loaded to a vote of potential handle](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m17s)

[link. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m19s)

[yeah, this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m23s)

[this is this is a good comment there as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m25s)

[well.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m28s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m29s)

[select the tab is not always but uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m32s)

[Oh, this is nice. So, let's see. Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m37s)

[interesting. So, using the arrow keys](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m40s)

[can get you into a fun situation.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m43s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m46s)

[same thing could happen with quick mouse](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m49s)

[clips, but I fix that. Fix that. Got it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m51s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m55s)

[and then bring these things here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m57s)

[Problem with focusable content.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h17m59s)

[Yeah. So those are those are perfect.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m04s)

[Okay. So those are well documented.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m06s)

[Yeah. Or it could turn on some wacky](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m10s)

[backgrounds and start going through](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m12s)

[family photos, etc. It could. It](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m13s)

[absolutely could. I mean I already kind](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m16s)

[of have some fun backgrounds so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m18s)

[and I I guess I could. So hang on. I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m21s)

[do this. It is It is Christmas time. We](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m23s)

[can turn on the Christmas background.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m27s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m30s)

[So, for anybody wondering, yes, that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m34s)

[a zoomed-in picture of my Christmas](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m37s)

[tree. My wife is an expert decorator and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m39s)

[does a wonderful job. And yes, I do have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m42s)

[a programmer ornament sitting there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m44s)

[So, yeah, there we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m47s)

[See, we'll we'll see if Copilot does](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m52s)

[anything fancy. Okay, so ZAML test here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m54s)

[because this was the other one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m56s)

[Um, and I I'm I am curious why some of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h18m59s)

[these things are failing, but I I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m03s)

[suspect they're failing due to part of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m05s)

[the issue of not being able to go to net](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m07s)

[10 yet. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m09s)

[yeah. So, we may we may just need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m14s)

[clean some of these up. But regardless,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m16s)

[here's the game plan. Here's the game](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m18s)

[plan. So for anybody who wants to follow](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m20s)

[along at home, these are the directions.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m22s)

[These are not hard directions. Microsoft](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m25s)

[has made this stupid simple to make MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m27s)

[servers. So before we dive in,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m30s)

[I mean, I made content, so we're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m33s)

[to use it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m35s)

[Okay. So what is an MCP server? And I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m37s)

[apologize if anybody watched Ben](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m42s)

[Michael's talk because I blatantly stole](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m43s)

[some of his content. So here's how MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m46s)

[works, right? You've got a host and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m49s)

[you've got an MCP server. And the host](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m51s)

[in this case, think of this as your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m53s)

[Visual Studio, your VS Code, etc. Right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h19m56s)

[That's that's all this is, right? The](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m00s)

[MCP server, even though it has the same](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m03s)

[server, it doesn't have to be remote.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m05s)

[Just like when we run our servers for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m07s)

[like ASP.NET, we can run them locally.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m10s)

[An MCP server in a lot of cases can just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m12s)

[be a little console application, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m15s)

[And that's where it leads into kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m18s)

[the next, right? Of what is the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m20s)

[transport that we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m24s)

[communicate between our host and our](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m25s)

[server with, right? Yeah. Running Docker](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m27s)

[is very viable as well, right? Because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m30s)

[that top line standard IO, right? This](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m32s)

[is just your console in console out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m34s)

[based stuff, right? Those are just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m36s)

[streams of data that can flow back and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m38s)

[forth. And so as long as the data](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m40s)

[flowing over those pipes conforms to the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m42s)

[MCP protocol, we're good, right? HTTP,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m44s)

[this is for your remote server stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m48s)

[There's also uh serverside events. Um I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m49s)

[think HTTP and standard IO are quickly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m52s)

[becoming the the common ones that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m54s)

[everybody uses, but it doesn't even](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m57s)

[preclude you from doing something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h20m59s)

[custom, right? So if people want to get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m00s)

[really fancy, we can go that route as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m02s)

[well. But I think the top two are where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m04s)

[most things lie, right? And this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m06s)

[idea where if you're running it local](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m09s)

[um let's see uh related aside or WCF yet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m12s)

[you could do WCF.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m17s)

[Um I don't know that I would encourage](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m20s)

[it but it's there's nothing I'll put it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m22s)

[this way. There's nothing in the specs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m24s)

[stopping you but it's one I think that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m26s)

[one of those just because you can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m28s)

[doesn't mean you should. Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m29s)

[related aside. Cloud just released](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m31s)

[built-in MCP for Chrome via the cloud](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m33s)

[extension today. I'm using it right now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m35s)

[That's fantastic. Oh, that is cool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m37s)

[Yeah. So, I specifically like I love](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m39s)

[typically run the cloud models for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m50s)

[almost all development related tasks](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m52s)

[because the cloud models in my opinion](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m55s)

[are awesome for development. I I like I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h21m57s)

[will switch around a little bit like I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m00s)

[might play with some of the GPT ones. If](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m02s)

[I'm doing like more documentation stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m04s)

[or if I just want a really cheap model](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m08s)

[because what I'm doing doesn't require](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m10s)

[smarts, I I'll definitely drop down for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m11s)

[those. But like if I'm doing development](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m13s)

[related stuff, you're going to see me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m15s)

[favor my sonnet stuff a lot. Um yeah, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m17s)

[will use GPT as a you sure about that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m22s)

[double check. Yeah, absolutely. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m24s)

[sometimes playing the models off of each](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m25s)

[other is a good way to double check it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m27s)

[But for the MCP communication stuff,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m30s)

[right, we can run the local one, do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m32s)

[standard IO, but again, we can run local](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m34s)

[against an HTTP as well or the remote](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m36s)

[MCP server, which is where you get like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m39s)

[the GitHub MCP server. Um, and it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m41s)

[important to note how new this stuff is,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m44s)

[right? Like this MCP stuff I like it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m46s)

[just passed its first birthday. Like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m49s)

[this is young. Um, and there was kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m51s)

[some competition in the AI space about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m54s)

[who's going to win on the protocol side](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m56s)

[of the fence. Um, and I it seems like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h22m58s)

[MCP is clearly the front runner. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m01s)

[there is also agent to agent, but those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m04s)

[are kind of two different things, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m06s)

[Those are how do I have one AI AI agent](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m08s)

[talk to another, whereas this is more](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m11s)

[how do I have an AI agent communicate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m13s)

[with a tool. So they they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m15s)

[depending on what you're doing they can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m19s)

[be similar but it they they are kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m21s)

[solving two distinct set of problems](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m24s)

[that you have there. So we've got remote](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m26s)

[servers local servers](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m29s)

[uh each protocol but then the thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m32s)

[behind the scenes that's important to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m35s)

[note because these are just running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m36s)

[applications that are there once the MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m37s)

[call comes in and the tool gets invoked](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m41s)

[you just write your own code. So what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m43s)

[you do with your own code is up to you,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m46s)

[right? You could go to a local data](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m47s)

[source. You could then make a call out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m49s)

[to a cloud API. You could do any of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m51s)

[those things, right? The first version](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m54s)

[of the GitHub um MCP server started as a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m55s)

[local app that you would run and it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h23m59s)

[communicated out to the uh GitHub APIs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m01s)

[out there. There's nothing stopping](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m05s)

[these green boxes from being other MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m07s)

[servers or other AI related things. Like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m09s)

[you can just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m12s)

[go against all kinds of stuff. Get a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m14s)

[local server to check itself against](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m16s)

[remote server. You absolutely again you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m17s)

[absolutely could. Again does just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m20s)

[because you can doesn't mean you should.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m22s)

[But you absolutely could do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m23s)

[Obviously the remote server is kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m25s)

[it unless you have set up some proxy or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m27s)

[something. It's not coming back in for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m29s)

[for local data. But again because we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m31s)

[have this capability your MCP server](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m35s)

[could easily do this. This is also why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m37s)

[because a lot of MCPs are being](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m40s)

[distributed either via npm or Nougat,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m41s)

[you if you're looking at a an MCP trying](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m45s)

[to decide if you should use it or not,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m48s)

[you evaluate it the same way you would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m50s)

[any third party Nougat package or any](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m52s)

[thirdparty npm, right? They have the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m54s)

[same kind of capabilities. There's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h24m58s)

[different kind of attack vectors with uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m00s)

[prompts coming in or otherwise but they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m02s)

[it's still the same idea is you are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m04s)

[grabbing somebody's thirdparty code that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m06s)

[is going to run and do things and the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m08s)

[stuff that you feed into it could be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m10s)

[your own code. So if you are running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m13s)

[this looking at you Izzy in a highly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m15s)

[secured environment most enterprises are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m18s)

[going to either have at least like a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m21s)

[white list of MCPs or they may ban them](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m23s)

[outright or otherwise because they are a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m25s)

[way of xfilling data if somebody goes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m27s)

[nefarious or if the MCP is just written](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m30s)

[poorly it could xfill data because of a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m32s)

[nefarious prompt that gets sent into it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m35s)

[So even if the MCP itself isn't um an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m37s)

[attack vector, if it's vulnerable to an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m41s)

[attack, it could become the the vehicle](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m43s)

[for it. Right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m46s)

[The last thing that's worth calling out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m49s)

[is again our host application. In our](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m51s)

[case, this is today is going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m53s)

[either VS Code or Visual Studio. I like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m55s)

[to bounce between them both, but there](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m57s)

[is technically an MCP client application](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h25m59s)

[or uh that gets started that's doing the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m02s)

[communication. This matters specifically](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m05s)

[for when you are building MCPs.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m08s)

[Understanding that there's a separate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m10s)

[client being started that does this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m11s)

[communication is quite important when uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m13s)

[you're like building and testing and you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m17s)

[want to understand who's locking the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m20s)

[output files in my bin directory for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m21s)

[example inn net right there is a client](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m23s)

[there and you kind of have to kill the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m26s)

[client to say hey let go of my bin](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m28s)

[directory so I can recompile with these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m30s)

[changes right not a big deal but it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m31s)

[worth knowing that that this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m34s)

[actual structure under the hood it's not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m36s)

[vs code just you know reaching straight](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m38s)

[over to the MCP. It's actually host](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m40s)

[going into the the client that's then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m43s)

[ending ending up making the call. Right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m45s)

[So there we have there we have there. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m47s)

[if anybody is interested, this is my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m50s)

[short list of uh no problem for me. Just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m52s)

[use new Git via USB drive and no](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m56s)

[internet my dev envir. I mean that that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h26m58s)

[will guarantee some amount of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m00s)

[functionality. As long as the the MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m02s)

[doesn't try to go remote, you're totally](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m04s)

[fine, right? Um, if you are using MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m05s)

[servers in your environment, these are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m10s)

[these are the ones that I kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m12s)

[consider the minimum for C.NET](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m13s)

[engineers, right? Microsoft Learn](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m17s)

[Context 7 is great for up-to-date](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m20s)

[information on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m22s)

[uh either thirdparty or open source](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m24s)

[projects because context 7 for people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m26s)

[unaware they kind of built the first](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m29s)

[popular rag system for open source stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m31s)

[where people just submit uh repositories](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m34s)

[and projects and they check it on a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m37s)

[somewhat continuous basis. So they're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m39s)

[they're usually never very far out of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m41s)

[date. Um, oftentimes within hours they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m43s)

[are up to date, which is awesome. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m47s)

[but even if the library doesn't write](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m49s)

[like migration docs or or have good docs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m52s)

[written, they rip through the code and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m55s)

[use the code as the source of truth to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h27m58s)

[generate information about the library.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m00s)

[So they can often get a pretty good](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m03s)

[picture of what a migration might need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m05s)

[to look like just from doing that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m07s)

[itself. So, especially if the library](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m09s)

[has a good testing suite or otherwise,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m11s)

[like there's a lot there that it can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m13s)

[pull from and it is great. They ha they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m15s)

[do have a paid tier. Um, and they it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m18s)

[used to be completely anonymous. Now,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m21s)

[they do make you sign up for an account,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m23s)

[get an API key, etc. Still free to use.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m25s)

[Um, and the free tier is got some limits](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m28s)

[on it. Um, but overall, awesome service.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m30s)

[100% support them. Um, the Nougat MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m34s)

[server in particular, this one is funny.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m39s)

[It comes pre-installed on VS 2026, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m41s)

[doesn't exist out on GitHub's own um MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m45s)

[registry yet. I think it's they're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m48s)

[they're trying to figure it out because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m51s)

[it does a lot of Windowsy specific](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m53s)

[stuff. You can install it into VS Code.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m56s)

[Just be aware you may I I have heard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h28m58s)

[mixed reports of using it outside of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m01s)

[Windows.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m04s)

[a and that kind of thing. Uh I wonder if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m06s)

[I could use my Azure DevOps MCP to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m08s)

[create release notes based on word](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m10s)

[templates and content in boards and git](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m12s)

[repos. Oh, that's an interesting one,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m15s)

[Izzy. I have not tried it on a a word](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m17s)

[template. Um but I would not be shocked](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m21s)

[to find that you could get something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m25s)

[working. One of the things that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m27s)

[important to note is oftentimes I will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m28s)

[two-step the process like rather than](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m31s)

[say hey generate my release notes based](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m34s)

[upon this word template I will sometimes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m36s)

[tell it to take the word template](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m38s)

[generate a markdown from it and then gen](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m40s)

[my release notes from that because uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m44s)

[markdown is very quickly becoming the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m46s)

[the language of AI for lack of better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m49s)

[words because it's just structured](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m52s)

[enough to be useful but loose enough to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m55s)

[where you can kind of do what you want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m58s)

[with it, right? And so it it does like I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h29m59s)

[absolutely use Copilot. I I was on a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m03s)

[call with my team earlier today and we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m05s)

[had found a a a bug in a release we were](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m08s)

[getting ready to go to production and I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m11s)

[asked the the project manager, I'm like,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m12s)

["Hey, have you filed a bug for this or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m14s)

[do you want me to do it?" And she's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m16s)

[like, "Oh, I haven't filed it yet. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m17s)

[go ahead and do it." And I literally](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m19s)

[popped my terminal, typed in copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m20s)

[prompt, create me a bug based upon my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m22s)

[current working directory changes, enter](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m25s)

[send, which was awesome. It was like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m27s)

[that is by far the laziest way to do it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m30s)

[Um, and then I had to go edit it because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m33s)

[unfortunately the description of the bug](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m35s)

[was hyper specific to my working](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m37s)

[directory changes and had no concept of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m40s)

[what the actual bug that we were fixing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m42s)

[was, but it was still funny and cool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m43s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m46s)

[yeah, company has a brand for all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m48s)

[documents. I have not won the argument](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m50s)

[of markdown yet. Yeah, but I suspect you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m51s)

[might be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m54s)

[to get those release notes because they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m56s)

[do have the M365 copilot that that can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h30m59s)

[do a lot of Office documents. And it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m02s)

[would not shock me at all if it was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m04s)

[somewhat](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m07s)

[easily possible to build out um some of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m08s)

[that yourself because creating uh Open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m11s)

[Office spec documents is a kind of a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m15s)

[well-knownish format. Um but it probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m16s)

[would not be difficult to do. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m20s)

[yeah, which which would be kind of cool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m25s)

[Um let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m29s)

[Uh, so yeah, Azure DevOps, GitHub,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m31s)

[depending on where you have your stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m33s)

[hosted. I will say the DevOps MCP, um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m34s)

[it's great for what's there. It doesn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m37s)

[cover all aspects of DevOps yet. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m39s)

[it's got most operations that involve,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m42s)

[uh, work items and repositories.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m45s)

[But if you're looking for things like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m49s)

[the the wiki or the dashboard or test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m51s)

[plans or any of that stuff, those things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m54s)

[are not there yet, right? They were try](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h31m57s)

[DevOps, they were just trying to get out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m00s)

[the basic one and repos and work items](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m02s)

[were the obvious hot path. Pipelines are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m04s)

[an obvious follow-up that I would expect](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m06s)

[them to start adding in as well. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m08s)

[just know it's there. It works, but it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m10s)

[not it doesn't cover the breadth of what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m12s)

[DevOps offers yet, right? GitHubs is out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m14s)

[there. I think the GitHub one is fairly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m17s)

[complete in most things for what you can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m19s)

[do. Again, most of it's focused around](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m21s)

[releases, issues, um, projects, uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m24s)

[repos, etc. Uh, and then Playright, and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m28s)

[this is the one that I want to model,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m31s)

[the one I want to build tonight on. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m33s)

[Playright is UI testing for web stuff,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m35s)

[right? Great. Um, and they have put out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m38s)

[some really cool agents that can gen UI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m41s)

[test. And in typical Playright fashion,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m44s)

[they started with their TypeScript ones](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m47s)

[because that's where Playright started.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m49s)

[it like it started in there and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m52s)

[came to net which is great and I was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m54s)

[like oh it's so close I want the net one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m56s)

[um and you can have it gen the net stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h32m58s)

[but the the tooling and the custom agent](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m00s)

[stuff that they've built currently is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m02s)

[not net again currently this is an arms](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m04s)

[race of people doing all kinds of stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m07s)

[um but it is they because they've built](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m10s)

[some really cool stuff I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m12s)

[model after it and see where it goes um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m13s)

[and then the last one is Azure if you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m16s)

[hosting there because frankly it is so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m18s)

[much nicer to have co-pilot like track](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m21s)

[down issues, pull information out of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m23s)

[Azure's APIs because their APIs kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m25s)

[suck to work with myself. I can't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m28s)

[remember all the commands. I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m30s)

[remember the CLI. It's got to memorized.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m31s)

[It rocks rules. So there's those ones.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m34s)

[Um, so there's the primer on MCP. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m38s)

[that's what it is. I want to build](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m42s)

[something similar to the Playright one,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m44s)

[but only for my ZAML library. That's the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m46s)

[game plan. That's the game plan. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m48s)

[we're going to go here, and I've gone](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m51s)

[through these docs now two or three](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m53s)

[times because I started building uh an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m55s)

[MCP for interacting with Microsoft Teams](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h33m57s)

[because the one that's out there for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m00s)

[graph was it was okay, but it didn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m01s)

[quite it didn't have the the tools](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m03s)

[exactly that I wanted. And so, I started](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m06s)

[building one. And then I was like,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m08s)

[shoot, this is easy. Let's do some more.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m09s)

[So, we're going to start here, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m11s)

[So, we're going to grab this. I'm going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m12s)

[to grab me a terminal.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m13s)

[Okay, grab terminal. We're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m16s)

[install this because they've got a net](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m18s)

[template out there which is great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m21s)

[Huzzah. Right. So, and you'll note](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m22s)

[they've got an AI chat web app template](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m25s)

[if you want to see that which is web](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m27s)

[blazer Aspire all the things. Great,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m31s)

[great, great. In this case, they've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m33s)

[a local MCP server. So, bear in mind](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m35s)

[this is going to be that local use case](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m37s)

[from above, right? We're going to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m40s)

[standard IO back and forth on this. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m41s)

[if you end up wanting to do a remote](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m44s)

[one, that's your a it's very similar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m46s)

[setup except for rather than a console](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m49s)

[app, you go ASP.NET Core, there's some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m50s)

[different extension methods to call, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m53s)

[it's the ASP.NET Core wrapper, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m55s)

[basically gives you like your OOTH stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h34m57s)

[for authentication, that kind of thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m00s)

[Because if you're hosting a web-based](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m01s)

[one, you probably want it authenticated.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m02s)

[probably like it doesn't have to be but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m07s)

[I I think most of the use cases I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m09s)

[come up with with a web-based HTTP MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m11s)

[server I I want authenticated so you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m14s)

[know there's that okay so then net new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m16s)

[MCP server so I'm going to start with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m19s)

[uh ZAML test right and I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m23s)

[in here and I'm going to go MK dur uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m25s)

[ZAML test MCP I think is what I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m28s)

[do right so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m33s)

[we're going to make a new we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m38s)

[make a new thingy here and then we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m40s)

[then we will run our net oh now I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m42s)

[this command now I want my net new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m46s)

[thingy mab bobber so now we come in here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m49s)

[now we do this do the thing generated](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m52s)

[the thing let me see did it just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m55s)

[generate project okay so it has re tools](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h35m57s)

[mcp did all the needful great okay so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m01s)

[Now,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m03s)

[where's my ZAML test?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m06s)

[Too many tabs. Not enough. I don't need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m08s)

[you open anymore. Uh, I don't have it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m12s)

[open. So, let me go grab that real](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m15s)

[quick.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m17s)

[Actually, it's probably in my MDX](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m18s)

[collection. There we are. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m21s)

[go there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m25s)

[And I was on a branch. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m27s)

[generator tests. Let's do I'm just going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m32s)

[to commit these real quick.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m36s)

[And then we are going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m42s)

[because that's why some of the other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m45s)

[ones I think are failing are this PR. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m46s)

[haven't actually gotten this one done.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m49s)

[Okay. So, we're going to jump back over](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m50s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m51s)

[Yeah. Jump. And then we're going to pop.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m53s)

[And then we're going to make a new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m57s)

[branch. Uh, we'll call it MCP. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h36m58s)

[Okay, now we're cooking with fire. Now](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m01s)

[we're cooking with fire. Okay, so open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m03s)

[open our fun time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m06s)

[And you'll note it does the template](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m13s)

[does add](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m16s)

[this guy in here. And I think on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m18s)

[read me, if I remember right, yeah, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m21s)

[shows you how to add in the the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m23s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m27s)

[let's go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m29s)

[And then we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m32s)

[need to add this to the solution to make](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m34s)

[it go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m36s)

[Then we probably are going to have we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m39s)

[going to have we're going to have some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m41s)

[fun times getting this thing set up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m42s)

[properly. But we will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m44s)

[uh let's see existing project.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m47s)

[Let's get it added. That's the wrong](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m50s)

[directory.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m52s)

[Uh, ZAML test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m54s)

[uh, ZAML test MCP MCP.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h37m58s)

[Okay. So, what did it give us? What did](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m02s)

[it give us? Let's just So, the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m05s)

[template does come with a read me with a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m08s)

[bunch of directions in it. Um, in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m11s)

[typical fashion, we're going to skip](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m13s)

[reading that for the moment. So, this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m14s)

[just a console app, right? It's using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m18s)

[top level statements. There's a generic](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m20s)

[host here. They wire up some logging,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m22s)

[but really this is just calling a couple](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m25s)

[magical extension methods. Add MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m27s)

[server, i.e. speak the MCP server stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m30s)

[Our transport protocol, we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m33s)

[do standard IO. There's an HTTP one. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m35s)

[then we can do with tools. Okay. Well,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m38s)

[what are the tools? In this case, it's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m41s)

[random number tools. And this is how](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m44s)

[hard it is to build an MCP tool. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m47s)

[it's just a function. The function needs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m50s)

[to be decorated with this attribute. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m53s)

[then you really should specify some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m56s)

[descriptions because this is how the AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h38m58s)

[tool. So you want to give it a useful](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m03s)

[description that indicates when this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m05s)

[should actually get invoked. Same thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m07s)

[with your parameters because the AI will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m09s)

[see the name of the parameter and the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m11s)

[type and that's about it. And so if you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m12s)

[don't give it some extra help, it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m15s)

[going to struggle a little bit. Now this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m17s)

[guy is fighting me a little bit because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m19s)

[he has uh we have centralized package](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m21s)

[management turned on here and this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m25s)

[not adhering to the rules. We are going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m27s)

[to fix that here real quick. Um it also](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m29s)

[is net 10 and has some extra stuff in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m33s)

[here. So hey co-pilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m36s)

[let's have some fun. Let's AI overlords](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m39s)

[do the thing for me. Okay. Uh no new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m42s)

[chat.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m45s)

[Um, update the MCP project to use](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m47s)

[centralized](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m53s)

[package management. There we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h39m55s)

[Okay, we're going to let it think about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m00s)

[its life.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m01s)

[Okay, so the important thing to note is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m07s)

[MCP servers can be distributed via](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m10s)

[Nougat and there is a special package](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m12s)

[type for MCP servers that are out there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m15s)

[Just like how um like global tools they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m18s)

[added a special package type fornet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m22s)

[tools that are distributed via Nougat,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m24s)

[we have added a special one for MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m27s)

[server. So if you want a quick and easy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m30s)

[way to distribute this, just note that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m32s)

[that does mean that your distribution](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m34s)

[mechanism is pushed out to Nougat and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m35s)

[then consumers have to then obviously](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m39s)

[rev that package in order to get it, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m41s)

[it does make for a quick and easy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m43s)

[deployment mechanism.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m45s)

[You'll know now we're actually in a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m47s)

[better state. It's verifying the build.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m48s)

[Great. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m51s)

[check the changes real quick. It added](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m54s)

[these in. Of course, it didn't put them](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m56s)

[in the item group that I wanted them in,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h40m58s)

[and then it dropped the versions there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m00s)

[So, we're we'll keep it for now. But,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m02s)

[you [ __ ] So, let's see. Um, I also do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m04s)

[find it's very important that you insult](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m08s)

[the AI at every step where it does it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m11s)

[wrong so that it remembers its place.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m13s)

[Um, if I can spell correctly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m16s)

[because I could have prompted it into](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m20s)

[doing that, but something's just quicker](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m22s)

[not. Um, okay. And then I just want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m24s)

[check my because I have a props file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m26s)

[here. And I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m29s)

[I think we can dial this up to 14 even](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m34s)

[with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m36s)

[Let me just check. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m38s)

[I think we can.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m41s)

[Was that a royal weed? Not just a Kevin](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m46s)

[said to do it, so jump to it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m48s)

[Yes, I think probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m56s)

[the let's see so nullable enable is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h41m59s)

[already covered there. Uh implicit using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m01s)

[I believe are already oh implicit using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m04s)

[aren't in here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m07s)

[Why do I not have implicit using up at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m09s)

[my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m11s)

[I don't know why I don't have implicit](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m13s)

[using turned on up here. So we're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m15s)

[to we're going to fix that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m16s)

[Um, turn those on everywhere. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m19s)

[The rest of these, I think, are fairly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m22s)

[specific to this package. So, we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m24s)

[going to leave, I think, the rest of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m27s)

[them here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m28s)

[And then, let's make sure we're still in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m30s)

[a happy compiling state.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m32s)

[And then we should be able to go and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m36s)

[test doing this because secretly what I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m38s)

[want to do is on this readme.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m40s)

[Um, so and this is why I was commenting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m44s)

[on needing to understand that MCP is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m52s)

[I might not be able to crank the lang](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m53s)

[version.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m56s)

[What's your problem here?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h42m58s)

[Path does not exist in current.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m02s)

[What?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m05s)

[Whoa.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m08s)

[What](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m12s)

[the I'm confused that I turned on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m17s)

[implicit using at the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m21s)

[props level and that broke it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m24s)

[Let's see here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m30s)

[I am I am surprised that turning on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m32s)

[implicit using broke that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m34s)

[because I don't have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m37s)

[interesting.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m41s)

[Okay. Well, let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m44s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m47s)

[That concerns me a little bit. Oh, is it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m49s)

[because I have Oh, it's probably because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m52s)

[I have this down here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m53s)

[So I don't need implicit using because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m56s)

[I've covered the that's that's why I had](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h43m58s)

[them off. Okay, because those are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m00s)

[covered there. So let me undo those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m03s)

[changes that I did.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m04s)

[Okay, because I had I have my own set of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m07s)

[global using specified](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m10s)

[here. I requires explicit info. Yes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m13s)

[Yes. There was somebody I was training](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m15s)

[on Tuesday that used the description um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m18s)

[slightly older individual, but he was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m21s)

[commenting back when he was at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m23s)

[university how his professor had asked](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m25s)

[you know if somebody could give a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m27s)

[definition of a computer and you know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m29s)

[people threw out all all kinds of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m31s)

[answers to him and he he finally told](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m34s)

[him like he's like no a computer is just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m35s)

[the fastest moving idiot and AI is just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m38s)

[the most](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m41s)

[perfect example of that. It is a very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m43s)

[incredibly fastmoving idiot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m45s)

[So that'll clear that up. Okay. So we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m50s)

[not going to we're going to try to avoid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m52s)

[touching anything inside the main ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m53s)

[test package. Um we may I think we'll be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h44m55s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m00s)

[I don't know if it's Yeah, because I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m02s)

[not tying my version down. So I should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m04s)

[be able to compile this sucker.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m06s)

[And since I'm not revving to net 10, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m09s)

[shouldn't get bit by the the issue that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m11s)

[was there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m13s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m14s)

[Okay. So, this one does have net 10](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m16s)

[here. If I go to publish this on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m18s)

[pipeline, I will probably have to set my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m19s)

[install SDK to have that. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m21s)

[we've got this. We've got this. We've](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m24s)

[got random number tools. This gu is now](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m26s)

[building. Okay. Step one. Let's make](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m28s)

[sure we can actually leverage this. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m30s)

[what I would like to do and close that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m32s)

[down. um is I would like to open up the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m34s)

[material design project because again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m38s)

[the end goal is to do this on Nikolai's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m41s)

[PR. So we're going to th this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m44s)

[goal, right? Is I would like to I would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m46s)

[like to have this just work. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m49s)

[that's the secret plan. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m54s)

[uh sure, fine. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h45m56s)

[are owned by someone other than the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m02s)

[current user. What?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m04s)

[Manage unsafe repositories.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m06s)

[Oh, that is a work tree I made for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m11s)

[somebody else's PR that I was reviewing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m15s)

[Let me go over here and I can blow away](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m17s)

[remove this work tree](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m22s)

[there. That will that will that will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m25s)

[take care of that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m28s)

[And then this is the homework tree and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m30s)

[it's just named after Nikolai's branch.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m33s)

[Great. Okay. So what I would like to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m35s)

[is I need to add the MCP in here and we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m39s)

[don't actually have it. So inside of VS](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m43s)

[Code you go well here I'll show you VS](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m46s)

[VS first and then we'll show the other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m49s)

[one. So inside of Visual Studio what you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m51s)

[are looking for is these little tooly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m53s)

[icons, right? So you click the tool and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m56s)

[you can see we've got we've got like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h46m59s)

[Nougat, Microsoft Learn, and GitHub](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m01s)

[Copilot tools. The built-in stuff is all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m03s)

[there, right? So Nougat is built in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m05s)

[inside of VS 2026. Um but the plus](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m07s)

[button here, right, gives us in as a way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m11s)

[of doing this. And you'll note we've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m14s)

[two places where we can store MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m16s)

[servers at a global level and at a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m17s)

[solution level. Here is the really,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m20s)

[really frustrating part. I want you to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m22s)

[pay attention to the name of these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m24s)

[files, right? These are MCP.json,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m26s)

[right? If we go and look at what VS Code](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m30s)

[wants when we do the same thing, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m34s)

[So, we click the little tool icon down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m36s)

[here, right? And then uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m39s)

[uh chat button was what your arrow](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m45s)

[pointed to. Oh, got it. Yeah. Yeah. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m47s)

[if I zoom this guy in, I'll try to get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m50s)

[it up higher. Right. So, this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m53s)

[button we are looking for. The little](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m55s)

[double E wrench. That's at least what it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h47m58s)

[is in Visual Studio. The um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m00s)

[VS Code, it's a screwdriver and uh a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m06s)

[wrench, I guess, is the way to describe.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m09s)

[I don't know. Um but if we go through in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m11s)

[here, you can see I've got a bunch of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m15s)

[tools installed already. Like, I've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m16s)

[the Get Kraken MCP. But if I look at the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m18s)

[the gear here, you can see that this guy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m22s)

[is here because I grabbed it from git](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m25s)

[lens. Git lens has uh the MCP bundled](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m28s)

[in. So I haven't actually like spanner](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m31s)

[icon. Got it. Thank you, Izzy. I believe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m34s)

[that is the correct term.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m36s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m39s)

[but I VS Code because you have all these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m40s)

[extensions and otherwise that can bundle](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m43s)

[in MCPS. I've got stuff that I'm picking](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m45s)

[up from a a variety of sources. I've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m47s)

[a decompiler MCP. I've got my context 7.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m50s)

[And if I look at these ones, these guys](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m53s)

[are coming in because I installed uh a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m55s)

[VS Code extension. There are a couple of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h48m58s)

[them. I think yeah, I configured global](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m01s)

[encode. So, there's some that I do have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m03s)

[these ones here, but you'll note up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m06s)

[here, you know, that user folder,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m08s)

[MCP JSON. The JSON files that VS Code](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m11s)

[and Visual Studio use are different](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m16s)

[files.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m18s)

[This is incredibly annoying. I suspect](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m20s)

[at some point Microsoft is going to fix](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m23s)

[this and get them all at even if they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m26s)

[don't if they have different defaults, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m29s)

[suspect they will get around to getting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m30s)

[both of them using a common file at some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m33s)

[point. So right now the unfortunate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m36s)

[truth is you have to set this up twice](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m38s)

[depending on whether you're in VS Code](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m42s)

[or Visual Studio. If you're using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m44s)

[something uh like cloud code or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m46s)

[otherwise I think they also have their](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m49s)

[own file for this same configuration](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m52s)

[again very very annoying](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h49m54s)

[and the reason I think that I can show](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m00s)

[you um as you can tell I don't run out a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m02s)

[lot uh github.com](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m05s)

[uhmcp](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m08s)

[right so this guy here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m10s)

[Kevin says so come on Microsoft yeah if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m13s)

[only That's how it worked. Um, so is he](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m15s)

[this one actually might be interesting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m19s)

[to you. There's this MCP server here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m20s)

[that you'll note has a shocking](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m23s)

[idea to it. So again, you might be able](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m27s)

[to get the AI to do what you want in two](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m31s)

[steps, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m33s)

[Prompted into there. So there's plenty](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m36s)

[of ways to get around doing it. This is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m38s)

[just a GitHub curated list of MCPS. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m40s)

[there's a lot more out there. You will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m44s)

[find tons of them, but these are like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m45s)

[GitHubs, curated, trusted, third](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m47s)

[parties, etc., etc., etc. So, if you are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m50s)

[interested in any of them, there are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m52s)

[plenty. Again, I have my my short list](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m54s)

[of things that I like. Um, but the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m57s)

[reason I say](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h50m59s)

[that everybody has their own is you come](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m01s)

[down on something like this and you'll](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m04s)

[see how everyone has this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m06s)

[right of of how to go through and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m10s)

[configure the the installation because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m13s)

[you'll note cursor wants it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m15s)

[incursor.mmcp.json.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m17s)

[Great. that there is yet another one. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m20s)

[wind surf, right? Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m24s)

[uh they don't call out the file path. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m28s)

[remember clicking through a bunch of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m30s)

[these at one point. Augment code. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m31s)

[they want to install it via an MPX. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m34s)

[there's um there's all kinds of ones. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m38s)

[so Izzy, scroll just right above you in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m42s)

[the chat. GitHub.commcp](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m44s)

[is the path you're looking for.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m46s)

[So again, GitHub curated list of MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m49s)

[servers. A lot more out there, but if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m53s)

[you want a a reasonably good kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m54s)

[safe curated list to go from, that's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m57s)

[pretty good starting place, right? They](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h51m59s)

[if you if there is some specific third](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m02s)

[party that you're using, it it is worth](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m05s)

[checking to see if they've added an MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m07s)

[server support. Um, I've been](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m09s)

[contemplating where I might want to plug](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m11s)

[one in on like Vellopac Flow because it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m13s)

[might be nice to just tell Copilot, hey,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m16s)

[publish my app for me. I don't want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m18s)

[think real hard.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m20s)

[That's a that's a thing it can do. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m22s)

[um, okay. But what I want to do here, so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m26s)

[I'm going to play just for sanity sake.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m29s)

[I'm going to play in VS Code inside of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m31s)

[the material design repository](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m34s)

[attempting to write the UI test for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m37s)

[Nikolai's PR. That's that's the thought](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m39s)

[here. That that's that's where we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m41s)

[going. Um, and that's what I'd like to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m43s)

[see happen. So again, I don't know if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m46s)

[this is going to work, but I want it to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m49s)

[work and therefore it should. So, I just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m50s)

[want to look at Okay, so tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m53s)

[tests is where we've got the stuff down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m56s)

[here, right? So, this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h52m58s)

[uh let's see. I wonder if they're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m01s)

[available on DockerHub. A lot of So, a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m03s)

[lot of MCPs can run uh or or you will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m06s)

[see deployments out on DockerHub. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m10s)

[will find that a lot of MCPs have a that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m12s)

[they're just let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m16s)

[they're just deployed either with NPX or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m19s)

[DNx. So npm versus Nougat. Um where is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m22s)

[one that does it? I believe playright's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m26s)

[an NPX one. Yeah. So plays distributed](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m28s)

[via um there. So it it actually would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m31s)

[not be terribly difficult to grab and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m34s)

[have a base image with all of this in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m37s)

[here. Um, with that said,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m39s)

[I feel like I have seen a handful of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m43s)

[these where they actually document the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m45s)

[Docker setup um, of how to be able to go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m48s)

[through and run each of these because at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m52s)

[the end of the day, if you have an image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m54s)

[that can run an npx command, that's it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m55s)

[That's all you need, right? So, building](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h53m58s)

[that image is probably not terribly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m01s)

[difficult. The only thing that gets](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m03s)

[interesting is making sure that you can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m05s)

[wire up the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m07s)

[um the communication between the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m09s)

[clients. Oh, there it is. There's the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m12s)

[Docker.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m14s)

[Uh yeah, so for example, Playright](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m16s)

[Docker only supports headless Chromium](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m18s)

[at the moment. What a shock. You're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m20s)

[inside a Docker container. Um, but yeah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m21s)

[so like the playright one does show](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m25s)

[setting it up, but it does it will be a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m27s)

[little bit dependent upon what the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m29s)

[what the the MCP server supports because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m32s)

[you're going to end up trying to figure](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m35s)

[out how to get that into the the right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m37s)

[state to have it work. But I mean, if if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m40s)

[you've got something that runs remote](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m42s)

[over HTTP, I don't see any reason why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m45s)

[you couldn't just shove that into a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m48s)

[Docker image, host the HTTP port, and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m49s)

[then wire up to that, right? That it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m52s)

[should work. Haven't tested it on any of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m56s)

[them, but I it it strikes me as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h54m59s)

[something that um could easily be done.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m01s)

[Okay. So, I want to go here and I am](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m05s)

[going to create a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m08s)

[uh we've already got uh GitHub. So, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m11s)

[just want to confirm where did it say](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m15s)

[the Well, I guess what we do is we do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m18s)

[this, right? So, we go So, to add a new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m20s)

[MCP server in VS Code, you're looking](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m23s)

[for the little MCP logo, which GitHub](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m25s)

[describes as a plug. I don't really see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m27s)

[it. Like if you if you [ __ ] your head](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m30s)

[funny, you can see the M, the C, and the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m31s)

[P all in the logo. Like that's the uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m34s)

[that's the idea there. Um, and so in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m38s)

[this case, we're going to do a standard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m40s)

[IO command. And we're going to call this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m41s)

[one ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m43s)

[And then uh in this case is going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m45s)

[net run](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m51s)

[project. And I'm just going to put foo](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m53s)

[in for a moment because I'll come back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m55s)

[here later. And then we are going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m56s)

[install it into our workspace.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h55m57s)

[Okay. So, there we go. So, it made us](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m00s)

[the VS Code folder. It put it in um it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m01s)

[promptly dropped the args.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m06s)

[That's not even close. Maybe I was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m10s)

[reading. Oh, I put the things in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m12s)

[wrong spot. That's what happened. I got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m15s)

[the name and the command backwards. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m17s)

[I'm going to go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m19s)

[X. Uh let's see. We're going to paste in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m21s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m26s)

[And this is going to be net and this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m28s)

[going to be now we do run](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m31s)

[project all the things but in my case I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m34s)

[don't want it there right so if we look](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m38s)

[at our readme of what they gave us to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m41s)

[here right so this is literally to start](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m45s)

[this MCP server it's just going to do a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m47s)

[net run command and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m49s)

[point it at our project and so what I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m51s)

[want to do is I want to grab this uh MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m53s)

[servers](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m57s)

[path. And I believe if I do this, I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h56m58s)

[go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m01s)

[uh copy full path.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m03s)

[And then we're just going to paste that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m06s)

[in here. Obviously, this isn't going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m07s)

[scale out nicely to anybody else. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m10s)

[got to we got to escape the things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m15s)

[for reasons. There we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m18s)

[uh start searching for Linux driver YTO](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m22s)

[and CMake MCP docker images. Yeah, like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m26s)

[this is this is the part where things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m30s)

[start to get really interesting really](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m31s)

[fast. Okay, so we're going to d go down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m33s)

[to ye dum model. So on GitHub copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m35s)

[for those people who aren't familiar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m38s)

[with it, right? The pricing model is in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m39s)

[premium requests per month, right? And a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m42s)

[premium request roughly translates to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m44s)

[did I kick the AI in gear to go do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m47s)

[something that usually consumes a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m49s)

[premium request. But it's a premium](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m51s)

[request times the model multiplier,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m54s)

[right? So it could be 1x, it could be a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m56s)

[third, it could be 3x, depends, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h57m58s)

[Depend depending on which one you are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m01s)

[looking at using, right? And so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m04s)

[obviously Microsoft loves their GPT](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m06s)

[ones. I still absolutely love my claude](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m08s)

[models. I like Opus. I really like Opus.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m12s)

[I don't know if I like Opus 3X more than](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m16s)

[Sonnet 45.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m18s)

[So, it's like uh like I like Opus. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m20s)

[think Opus is better, but is it 3x](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m23s)

[better? I don't know. I don't know. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m26s)

[my default setting right now is Claude](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m29s)

[Sonnet 45 um until it struggles and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m31s)

[I kick Opus on. That's that's that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m35s)

[currently my game plan because it's like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m36s)

[I don't know if I actually think it's 3x](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m39s)

[better.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m41s)

[Um but when we want to be cheap, we come](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m43s)

[up here and we grab uh the the cheap GPT](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m46s)

[41 or 40 models. The other thing you can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m50s)

[do is you can set it to auto. Auto has](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m52s)

[Hey, welcome fellow coder. Um the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h58m57s)

[problem with auto is that occasionally](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m00s)

[it doesn't understand the model's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m03s)

[capabilities and sometimes picks a bad](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m05s)

[model. Um specifically I run into this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m07s)

[problem because some models will accept](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m09s)

[what they call multimodal input meaning](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m11s)

[text images etc. You can feed it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m14s)

[different modalities. Um and auto](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m16s)

[sometimes doesn't understand that and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m20s)

[picks models that can't handle the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m21s)

[input. It's like h](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m23s)

[I hate that. So, I I use auto when I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m26s)

[don't care. Um, but in this case, we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m29s)

[going to go cheap and we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m31s)

[turn this uh I want you off of here. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m33s)

[auto usually uses Sonnet 45 for me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m37s)

[Yeah, in a lot of cases it auto does](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m39s)

[jump up there um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m41s)

[to be able to get that in. And yeah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m45s)

[sometimes you just need to be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m47s)

[paste a screenshot. So, if I care about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m48s)

[the quality of the work, I'm picking a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m50s)

[cloud model. That's that's my general](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m52s)

[operating procedure. And I think a lot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m54s)

[of people have different guidance around](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m56s)

[how they use AI and I I don't know that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=00h59m58s)

[anybody's wrong yet. I think there's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m01s)

[lot of depend there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m04s)

[subjectivity in it and because these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m07s)

[things are inherently non-deterministic](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m10s)

[like you you start to just get a feel](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m14s)

[for it over time to see yeah this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m17s)

[generally gets me where I want because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m19s)

[sometimes it's like maybe the prompt](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m21s)

[isn't very good that that is definitely](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m23s)

[a possibility. Let me my font size is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m26s)

[tiny in here. Um let's bump vs up a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m27s)

[little bit. Hey, thank you for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m30s)

[follow, Kodakula. I'm hopefully I'm not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m32s)

[butchering that too bad.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m36s)

[Yeah, there's no wrong or right, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m38s)

[there are definitely trends leading us](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m39s)

[to a specific way. Absolutely. The one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m41s)

[thing I'm going to point out too, a very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m44s)

[common pattern that seems to get very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m46s)

[good results is starting with the agent,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m48s)

[making a plan, and iterating on that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m52s)

[plan until you're happy with the end](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m55s)

[with what's being described, and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m56s)

[executing on the plan. as a general way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h00m58s)

[of getting stuff done. That tends to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m01s)

[work fairly well. Um especially if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m03s)

[you're doing something bigger, right? If](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m06s)

[you're doing Oh, thank you for the sub.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m08s)

[Uh if you're doing something small and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m11s)

[and and isolated, it does usually you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m14s)

[can kind of do the the oneshot prompt](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m18s)

[and go type situation. That's fine,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m20s)

[right? But anything bigger or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m21s)

[complicated doing that kind of plan and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m23s)

[then execute on the plan so much so VS](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m26s)

[Code has actually built in this plan](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m29s)

[mode and the plan mode isn't that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m31s)

[special like what future Kevin says is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m34s)

[right everything else is wrong. Thank](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m38s)

[you Izzy. I appreciate that. Um the plan](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m39s)

[mode is basically just kind of walks you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m42s)

[through doing that right. you can get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m44s)

[the same kind of results starting in ask](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m46s)

[mode, kind of iterating, going through](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m48s)

[and doing it, flipping over to agent,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m50s)

[and then depending on your geek level. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m51s)

[currently like make it so as the way of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m54s)

[telling it to to just rock and roll,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m56s)

[right? Um, but yeah, and then yeah, the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h01m58s)

[custom plan mode though it Yes, these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m02s)

[custom agents incredibly powerful. If](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m05s)

[people are interested, let me know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m08s)

[because I again, I just did a whole](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m09s)

[bunch of co-pilot training for a client](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m11s)

[earlier this week and so I have tons of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m13s)

[material on this. The nice part is I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m15s)

[have tons of material that's current as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m17s)

[of last week. The problem is if I wait](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m19s)

[like six months, I guarantee you the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m22s)

[material is going to be vastly out ofd.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m23s)

[It's going to be great. That's the other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m25s)

[drawback is all of this AI material is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m27s)

[usually good for maybe a month or two](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m30s)

[and then enough changes to where if you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m32s)

[haven't updated your material, it's it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m34s)

[crap again. So, there's that. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m35s)

[see. On that note, uh, compaction is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m38s)

[really difficult to deal with, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m41s)

[upgrade to the latest cloud model ship](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m42s)

[compaction uh, times from 2 minutes 15](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m44s)

[seconds to about 10 seconds. Nice.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m48s)

[Nice. I I will say I don't there are a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m51s)

[lot of good sites out there for doing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m54s)

[like model comparisons um on specific](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m56s)

[problems and I will check them like once](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h02m59s)

[every month or two and then go there](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m02s)

[vastly out of I don't know friend I've](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m05s)

[been using the same AI practices for a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m07s)

[while the current practices are finally](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m08s)

[catching up to to me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m10s)

[yeah well I should say my material is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m15s)

[out of date I don't know that the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m17s)

[principles have actually changed that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m18s)

[much right because Like I think a year](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m20s)

[ago, we were helping people migrate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m23s)

[repositories by doing the same type of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m25s)

[planning type flow, right? Where it was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m28s)

[like, okay, we're going to take the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m31s)

[repo, we're going to build the plan up,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m32s)

[we're going to iterate with the AI, and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m33s)

[then we're going to have the AI execute](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m35s)

[on the plan. The models weren't as smart](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m36s)

[back then. And so it didn't do as much,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m39s)

[but it like that the premise still](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m41s)

[works. A lot of my material has like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m44s)

[GitHub links and otherwise and even](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m46s)

[their docs aren't up to date with all of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m49s)

[the models that are out because things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m51s)

[just keep releasing so quickly. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m52s)

[yeah, even if the process doesn't change](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m56s)

[much. Yeah, and I uh Kodak, yeah, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h03m58s)

[completely agree. I think there is this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m01s)

[generalized process that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m03s)

[fairly common across the people who are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m07s)

[very productive with it. The other key](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m10s)

[tip that I will tell people that I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m13s)

[has been very good is and again I could](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m15s)

[probably do a whole stream on this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m18s)

[Maybe I should do that next week. Um is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m19s)

[things like prompt files, instruction](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m22s)

[files, custom agents, all of these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m24s)

[things where it's just marked down all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m27s)

[the way down, right? Getting yourself](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m28s)

[productive is great. Getting your team](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m31s)

[productive is better. Like just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m33s)

[yesterday, um I went through and did a a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m36s)

[custom agent with a prompt file because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m38s)

[we have a a wiki out on Azure DevOps um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m40s)

[that we have been struggling to keep up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m43s)

[to date and I uh I went and built out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m45s)

[that custom model and it then got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m50s)

[everything up to date and more](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m53s)

[importantly it kind of documented what I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m54s)

[had been doing myself to where the rest](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m56s)

[of the team can now do it. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h04m59s)

[I think I disagree, but I think it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m01s)

[also a matter of view preference. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m03s)

[think the tools around it are evolving a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m05s)

[lot, which could be what you were](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m07s)

[talking about, but the LLM is in general](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m08s)

[haven't changed too much on how to use](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m10s)

[them. Well, which is what I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m12s)

[specifically focusing. Okay. No, I I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m13s)

[think code you're we're I we are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m15s)

[probably agreeing on a lot of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m20s)

[because I I do focus kind of heavily on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m23s)

[the tool side of it rather than just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m25s)

[interacting with it. Um, in my day job,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m27s)

[we often refer to kind of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m30s)

[distinction as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m32s)

[um, building on AI and building with AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m35s)

[because they're kind of two different](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m39s)

[things, right? Like it gets weird](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m41s)

[because my one of the projects that I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m42s)

[on right now is very much an AI driven](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m45s)

[application.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m47s)

[And so we do both and so it go it goes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m49s)

[back and forth.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m52s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m54s)

[yeah. Specifically speaking about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m57s)

[context, windows, compaction, etc. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h05m59s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And Izzy, I said I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m01s)

[didn't say Christmas day. I said](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m05s)

[potentially next week. I may try I may](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m06s)

[try to push my stream next week onto a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m08s)

[different day. So again, people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m10s)

[interested, Discord link is cycling](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m12s)

[through here. There's a there's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m14s)

[streaming channel in there. I will try](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m16s)

[to post if I'm moving stuff around. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m18s)

[let's see. I work on a Discord uh bot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m21s)

[task manager for ADHD people. Oh, cool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m23s)

[That uses AI to determine what task uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m26s)

[to bring up and how to talk with them.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m29s)

[Oh, see code. I need to get my bot set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m32s)

[up to actually respond to those. Um if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m35s)

[you'll note, there is a um a pattern to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m39s)

[my links at the bottom. See, I did I did](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m41s)

[DNS redirection rather than, you know,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m44s)

[actual bot stuff on here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m47s)

[I should spend more time on my Twitch](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m50s)

[stream stuff as well. I've got too many](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m52s)

[I got too many side projects. Got it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m54s)

[Um, okay, cool. So, let's So, I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h06m57s)

[start here of actually see this work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m01s)

[Uh, generate me a random number, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m03s)

[So, this should and we're going to flip](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m07s)

[it over to agent mode because ask,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m09s)

[you'll note, doesn't have tools. Agent](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m11s)

[mode has tools. And we want to come down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m13s)

[here and we want to hit update tools so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m16s)

[that it actually so this is going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m18s)

[actually execute the command that we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m20s)

[have here. So it's going to do a net](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m22s)

[run-](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m24s)

[project pointed at the project we just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m25s)

[built. Uh let's see the build failed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m27s)

[Fix the build errors and try again. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m31s)

[let's see what did we do wrong. Current](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m33s)

[SDK does not support targeting net 10](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m35s)

[either. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m36s)

[what did I do wrong? Oh. Oh, that's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m42s)

[dirty problem](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m45s)

[because I have a global.json in here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m48s)

[dialing me down to nine. It's going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m50s)

[bite me. Okay. Well, you know what?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m52s)

[Screw it. We're doing that for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m54s)

[moment. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m55s)

[I should spend more time on my Twitch](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h07m58s)

[developer. True developer words. Amen.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m00s)

[Amen. It's one of those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m03s)

[Yeah, I've got too many side projects. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m06s)

[will say AI has helped me get a lot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m08s)

[further on a lot of my side projects](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m11s)

[because they've stopped being just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m13s)

[conceptual ideas and actual things with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m14s)

[code behind it. So there is that AI has](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m16s)

[just enabled my bad habits. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m19s)

[I should code spends 12 hours setting up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m23s)

[an ID. Ah yes yes well so I have another](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m25s)

[bad habit where I oftentimes love to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m29s)

[on multiple calls at the same time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m32s)

[Um, like I will run dual Teams calls or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m35s)

[a Zoom and a Teams call at the same](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m38s)

[time. And I unfortunately got this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m40s)

[little knockoff brand stream deck, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m42s)

[it's got little dials on it. And once I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m45s)

[found out that I could write my own](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m49s)

[plugins for it, the the sky was the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m50s)

[limit. And so me and Copilot, we built](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m52s)

[some plugins. So now I can dial the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m55s)

[volume of the meetings individually up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m56s)

[and down on those things, which again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h08m58s)

[something I probably wouldn't have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m01s)

[invested a lot of time doing on my own,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m02s)

[but it's now just enabled my bad habits](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m05s)

[to continue on even further. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m08s)

[see. I absolutely love uh AI LLM and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m12s)

[hate the corporations driving them. I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m15s)

[a big proponent of us not needing to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m17s)

[develop these dumb kitchen sinks models.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m18s)

[Instead, focus on specialized ones.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m20s)

[Yeah. And that I there is a lot of very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m22s)

[interesting stuff because I do like the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m25s)

[the hugging face stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m28s)

[Honestly, I'm a little cheap and so the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m32s)

[fact that like I get subscriptions to a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m34s)

[lot of the Microsoft and Azure stuff,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m37s)

[I'm definitely biased in that favor. But](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m39s)

[it is it is definitely a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m42s)

[it is it is kind of driven by the fact](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m45s)

[that you know when you've got a free](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m47s)

[subscription, you you use it. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m49s)

[generate me a random number. This should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m51s)

[now show me my tool now that I have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m53s)

[update tool. So get random number. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m55s)

[this is effectively this is like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h09m57s)

[underhanding the speaker an easy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m00s)

[question that they already know the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m02s)

[answer to. So it should go it should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m03s)

[invoke our tool and then we should be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m06s)

[able to go through and do this. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m08s)

[whenever you add an MCP server at least](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m09s)

[in copilot you will get prompted to say](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m11s)

[do you want to allow this right and so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m14s)

[it's telling you the inputs and the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m17s)

[outputs and you can allow it and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m18s)

[you can also allow it in a session in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m20s)

[this workspace or always allow now in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m22s)

[this case](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m24s)

[if you do always allow something you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m26s)

[have to be careful what you are allowing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m28s)

[understanding that this is going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m30s)

[always available given that this is me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m32s)

[I'm going to trust myself my own MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m35s)

[server is something I'm comfortable](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m39s)

[always allowing. Yay, my random number](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m40s)

[is 13, right? And so you can even dive](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m42s)

[in here and look and see, hey, here are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m45s)

[the function parameters that it decided](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m46s)

[to go with. There's the output one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m48s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h10m52s)

[cool. Yeah. But um Kodakula, if you do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m00s)

[want to feel free to drop in the Discord](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m04s)

[and in the general channel, feel free to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m06s)

[to plug stuff. I do I do like when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m08s)

[people have cool projects that they want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m11s)

[to show off. The only thing I watch](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m13s)

[people on is that people aren't just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m14s)

[like repeatedly spamming, but by all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m16s)

[means, if you got something cool to show](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m18s)

[off or looking for testers, you can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m19s)

[absolutely post it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m21s)

[Okay, we have working MCP.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m24s)

[Well, but we've we've got we've got the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m27s)

[the basics going. We got the basics](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m30s)

[going. Okay. So, question one. Question](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m31s)

[one is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m34s)

[for doing this I I'm thinking the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m37s)

[capabilities](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m42s)

[uh I don't usually like to just talk](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m44s)

[about programming. Uh I'll post a link](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m46s)

[to the GitHub. Cool. Yeah. No,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m48s)

[absolutely. Like I think sometimes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m50s)

[developers are they they underell their](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m51s)

[work more than more than they probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m55s)

[should because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m57s)

[people often have cool stuff especially](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h11m59s)

[if it's a passion project I find those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m01s)

[are often a lot cooler than people give](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m03s)

[themselves credit for. Um so some key](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m04s)

[capabilities that ZAML test has that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m08s)

[think I am looking to expose. One it can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m11s)

[take an arbitrary chunk of ZAML and just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m13s)

[dump it into a WPF app and run it. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m16s)

[is cool. I kind of want to give Copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m19s)

[that capability. It has the ability of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m21s)

[querying back um elements, but the query](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m25s)

[the back of the elements is usually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m29s)

[assumes that the caller knows them. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m32s)

[there's not it doesn't currently expose](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m34s)

[like a give me back the tree, but it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m36s)

[could it absolutely could. We may end up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m39s)

[needing to give something of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m42s)

[nature, I think.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m44s)

[um it has things for input and so mouse](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m46s)

[and keyboard as well as screenshot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m49s)

[capabilities and I think I want to give](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m51s)

[those easily to it. So um we are going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m53s)

[to just abandon this random number tools](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h12m57s)

[uh internal class uh zaml](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m00s)

[test uh let's do image tools because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m04s)

[think I'm I'm I think I'm going to break](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m09s)

[these up kind of by gross level of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m10s)

[capabilities. I think um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m17s)

[let's see once the alpha was done I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m19s)

[to promote it uh and live off supporting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m21s)

[it while also offering it as open source](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m23s)

[that so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m25s)

[100% the I think the hard part is people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m28s)

[figuring out how to offer it open source](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m32s)

[and be able to support it. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m35s)

[it is very I won't say it is somewhat](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m40s)

[contentious of how people go about doing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m43s)

[it. There are a handful of projects that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m45s)

[I've seen do it and appear to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m47s)

[succeeding. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m51s)

[like the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m54s)

[Jimmy, the author of like Automapper,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h13m56s)

[um, has made a pivot to it recently. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m00s)

[mean, there were some people very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m04s)

[unhappy about it. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m05s)

[but yeah there there are ways of going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m08s)

[through and and doing it. Um yeah to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m11s)

[make to make it there. Uh I bet people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m15s)

[would pay to have access to my instance.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m18s)

[I see I I agree with that sentiment. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m19s)

[in the note of plugging stuff, right? So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m24s)

[Vellopac is one that I am a founder of.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m27s)

[Um so this guy is open source. So, it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m31s)

[an installer update framework for your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m34s)

[thick client apps. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m36s)

[Um, but we also have a hosted service.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m39s)

[It's not something we are advertising](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m44s)

[yet because we're still making some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m46s)

[potentially breaking API changes on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m48s)

[back side, but I've been using it for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m50s)

[building and deploying my apps. And so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m52s)

[even though people could build their own](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m55s)

[servers and host it themselves, there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m57s)

[enough complexity there that we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h14m59s)

[basically making the same bet, right? Of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m02s)

[there it's an involved process that some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m06s)

[people will who want that level of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m10s)

[control will just do it anyway, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m12s)

[And so we're like, we're not going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m14s)

[stand in your way. Have at it. But there](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m15s)

[will be plenty of people that pay for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m17s)

[that convenience. And so I mean I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m19s)

[that business model is sound enough that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m23s)

[I've bet on this the same kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m25s)

[design. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m32s)

[yeah and fine-tuned models and your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m34s)

[models won't be be open source. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m36s)

[And I think those types of things work](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m38s)

[great, right? Like I think that's that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m40s)

[not too unlike how some of the the AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m42s)

[systems out now are being done where you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m45s)

[know the you can do your own uh your own](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m48s)

[if you want but you're then you know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m52s)

[bringing your own key and cheap models](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m53s)

[but the the specialized fine-tuned ones](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m56s)

[are you know behind a a hosted service](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h15m58s)

[and you pay for access to it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m01s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m06s)

[So let's see. Let maybe we should start](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m08s)

[with something different. We should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m10s)

[start with start app. Um ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m11s)

[I guess we I guess we can just do app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m16s)

[tools, right? I we I don't think we need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m18s)

[all of these. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m20s)

[uh I think the issue right now with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m25s)

[local models is it's near impossible to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m26s)

[get around hallucinations.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m28s)

[I think that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m30s)

[true only because of the power people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m34s)

[have locally. I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m36s)

[there now I I got to be careful because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m39s)

[there's a handful of people that join](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m42s)

[this stream quite a bit that have shared](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m43s)

[their local setup and it's darn near a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m46s)

[mini data center. They are insane and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m48s)

[I'm jealous and it's awesome. I do not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m51s)

[have the power to run anything](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m53s)

[significant of size. But I think like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m55s)

[you aren't you aren't wrong acid rain.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m58s)

[are you do need a significant amount of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h16m59s)

[juice if you're going to run a a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m02s)

[reasonably good](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m05s)

[um yeah chat GPT levels from inference](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m08s)

[from their local setup. Yeah, and I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m11s)

[think that's the problem is local setup](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m13s)

[you you really need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m15s)

[you need some juice to make it go. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m18s)

[yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m25s)

[Yeah. So trying to put tools that work](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m27s)

[well in folks hands is hard. No,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m29s)

[completely agree. And that I think is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m30s)

[why so many of the AI like the hosted](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m32s)

[models are there. And then the other one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m36s)

[that people are struggling with is is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m38s)

[proper billing of AI services. It's hard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m39s)

[because it's so variable on usage. It is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m42s)

[difficult to price it well. like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m45s)

[co-pilot. That's why they came up with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m48s)

[this premium request idea because it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m49s)

[kind of arbitrary how many tokens are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m53s)

[going to get cons and how much AI juice](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m55s)

[is going to get consumed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m57s)

[Uh like it's it's random, right? And so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h17m59s)

[I like I don't doubt Cop-lot did a lot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m04s)

[of, you know, heruristics to try to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m06s)

[figure out, you know, where can we price](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m08s)

[this and be fairly confident we're not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m10s)

[going to, you know, shoot ourselves in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m12s)

[the foot and lose too much money because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m13s)

[I I suspect they tried to price it as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m15s)

[cheap as they could given the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m17s)

[competition. Like right now, everybody](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m19s)

[wants to corner the market. So I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m21s)

[there there was probably an idea of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m22s)

[let's just not lose money and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m24s)

[and then go from there, right? like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m29s)

[because if we can get vendor lock in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m31s)

[that that's the goal at the moment is we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m33s)

[need to win the popularity war um and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m35s)

[and just not lose out on anything yet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m38s)

[and then you know deal with that later](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m44s)

[and be there. Um hey uh harmless binding](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m48s)

[error that shows up in nested tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m53s)

[control very annoying. Um, Essen, if you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m54s)

[want to throw a uh a small example of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h18m57s)

[what it takes to reproduce, let me know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m00s)

[and I can take a look at the binding](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m01s)

[error. It may be a legitimate issue in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m03s)

[our tab control. We don't do a lot of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m05s)

[nested tab controls, but the one use](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m08s)

[case where it does crop up is when you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m10s)

[use like the the navigation bar on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m13s)

[side and then have like a tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m15s)

[there. Oh, look at that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m17s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m20s)

[let's see. Are you using semantic kernel](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m22s)

[for the for my day job inside uh where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m23s)

[we are uh building on top? We do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m27s)

[leverage semantic kernel. Yes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m29s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m33s)

[let's see. Make a project called Doom AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m36s)

[AI gaming buddy. You can talk to talk](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m38s)

[back. Train him on games by shaking wiki](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m41s)

[sites and such and still use context](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m43s)

[word inference. And he hallucinated](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m46s)

[weapons from games that didn't exist](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m48s)

[despite being told to do a vector](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m49s)

[search. Ah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m51s)

[that that is interesting. Um, I assume](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m57s)

[you're familiar with like the rag](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h19m59s)

[pattern and similar. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m01s)

[There's the replacement. I mean, you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m07s)

[as you've basically handed me a gorgeous](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m10s)

[situation. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m13s)

[uh, let's see. Open with Kraken.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m16s)

[Should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m19s)

[probably just takeick this box and say](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m23s)

[always.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m25s)

[Uh, let's see. Clone from URL. Uh, sure.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m27s)

[That looks good.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m30s)

[Let's take a Let's take a quick gander](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m33s)

[and see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m35s)

[Let's take a quick gander because I will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m38s)

[say there there is a real chance that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m39s)

[this is a legit Well, I guess in your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m41s)

[case, this isn't even using my library,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m43s)

[is it? That was just a standard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m45s)

[That is Oh, so this this isn't even](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m52s)

[related to the material design. This is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m55s)

[just straight WPF. Okay. So, that'll be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h20m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m02s)

[uh let's see. My next part is a game](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m08s)

[engine for Discord Twitch that uses AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m10s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m12s)

[and only relying on the AI to narrate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m14s)

[calls tools. We can have a better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m17s)

[experience so you can revert the AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m18s)

[actions if it makes mistakes. Yeah. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m21s)

[I secretly have a side project trying to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m23s)

[do something for like running my board](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m25s)

[gaming stuff because I have a a similar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m28s)

[desire.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m32s)

[But it is kind of in that case it's kind](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m34s)

[of coded to me because reasons.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m37s)

[Let's see if I create tab items manually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m42s)

[or remove the selected item binding near](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m44s)

[the inner tab control the air goes away.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m46s)

[Okay. So let's fire this guy up and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m49s)

[we'll go take a look at what you've got.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m50s)

[We'll start at the top. Main window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m53s)

[We'll work our way down. There's that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h21m56s)

[So let's see. Main window has a tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m00s)

[control with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m04s)

[uh so a data template with a parent tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m08s)

[view](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m11s)

[and a tab control t have view models.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m12s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m18s)

[And let's see, view model. Very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m20s)

[simplistic. Has a list in there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m23s)

[Parent tab view model](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m29s)

[A B C. Okay. Where's my output window? I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m32s)

[need to see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m36s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m40s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m42s)

[let's see. Relative source tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m44s)

[ancestor level one tab strip placement](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m46s)

[target element is tab item. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m50s)

[let's go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m52s)

[That guy goes there. And then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h22m56s)

[t have control display member item](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m03s)

[source selected item.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m05s)

[See. Yeah. My desire was to be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m12s)

[play D and D with my girlfriend. I got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m13s)

[it working in Chad GBT with custom GBT.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m15s)

[It doesn't work well in Discord. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m17s)

[that that I am not surprised at. There's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m20s)

[been a handful of people I've seen do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m23s)

[like D and D is one that there is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m24s)

[there's actually going to be competition](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m28s)

[because I've seen several people start](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m29s)

[building them now. Everybody's obviously](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m31s)

[charging for them because they they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m33s)

[consume tokens and whatnot, but I I have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m34s)

[this this weird desire to build](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m36s)

[something that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m39s)

[basically build it and release it open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m41s)

[source, but I have a like you have to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m43s)

[plug in your own keys and whatnot. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m47s)

[way, it's like, eh, go have fun because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m49s)

[I I'm mostly building mine for me. If it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m52s)

[makes me happy, all of my users that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m55s)

[care about are happy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h23m57s)

[Wow. I see why this one was baffling you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m02s)

[for a little bit](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m04s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m07s)

[find ancestor tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m10s)

[ancestor level](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m14s)

[target elements tab item. So one of the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m19s)

[tab items is pointed in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m22s)

[where it's tab strip placement.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m25s)

[The target property is no target of type](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m29s)

[object. So it's got to be the issue](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m32s)

[where tab controls are unloading.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m34s)

[It's not there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m38s)

[So let me Okay, reproduction steps.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m45s)

[Let's just get this exactly right.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h24m48s)

[Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m01s)

[what's really surprising me is that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m04s)

[there's four of them.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m06s)

[It's surprising to me that they come in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m10s)

[groups of four, which may which leads me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m12s)

[to strongly believe that it's these four](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m14s)

[that are there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m16s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m18s)

[Yeah, I'm building the tools I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m23s)

[play with. Exactly. Um, Sesame AI, go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m25s)

[have a chat with it and be absolutely](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m29s)

[blown away. Acid. Yeah, I'll go take a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m30s)

[look at it. Like there there's been so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m33s)

[many out there. It's been interesting.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m35s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m38s)

[yeah, releasing everything I as open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m40s)

[source and I do the same thing. It's one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m42s)

[of those part of me feels like, oh, you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m45s)

[know what? It'd be cool. Like I found](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m47s)

[out some software that I helped build at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m49s)

[one point. The the company I built it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m51s)

[for sold it for millions of dollars. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m53s)

[was like, "Dang, nab it. Dang nab it."](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m54s)

[Now admittedly, like they're the ones](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m57s)

[who paid for the development time and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h25m59s)

[took the the business risk on it. I was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m01s)

[like, "Dang it. Clearly I could build](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m03s)

[stuff that's worth millions of dollars,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m05s)

[but dang it."](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m07s)

[Because yeah, that's what happens when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m11s)

[you get contracted to build stuff. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m13s)

[get paid for what you build and they](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m15s)

[take the the risk and possibly the cash](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m18s)

[out on it. Um, let me grab Snoop real](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m21s)

[quick.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m24s)

[You've got a weird one here. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m26s)

[yeah. Yeah. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m31s)

[Snoop this sucker and move you to the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m34s)

[side. And let's take a let's take a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m36s)

[gander at what's going on in here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m38s)

[because I I suspect it's going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m40s)

[these tab items here. That's my theory.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m42s)

[And then specifically because this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m45s)

[pointed at tab strip placement that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m48s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m51s)

[tab strip placement here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m54s)

[it's binding there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h26m59s)

[Tried everything fixing it. Nothing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m07s)

[works. Seems to be a WPF bug. It it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m08s)

[absolutely does seem to be a WPF bug.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m11s)

[the fact that it's reaching up like some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m14s)

[of these things are default behavior](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m16s)

[right like ancestor level one I suspect](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m17s)

[the actual code and actually you know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m20s)

[what let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m24s)

[let's just go look real quick because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m25s)

[WPF is open source so you know there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m29s)

[that um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m31s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m35s)

[let's see here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m37s)

[um themes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m41s)

[And I believe we are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m44s)

[I think we're in classic. I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m51s)

[actually know though.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h27m55s)

[let's go. If I just search tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m01s)

[here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m03s)

[I can probably find my way into it from](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m05s)

[that. Only 32 code references. Yeah. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m09s)

[there's the automation one control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m12s)

[template default tab control style](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m15s)

[presentation framework fluent.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m17s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m20s)

[this guy here I think is the magical](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m22s)

[indentation. Removing selected item](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m25s)

[binding fixes it. Yeah. The thing is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m27s)

[selected item binding is just going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m29s)

[be taking you from unselected to the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m31s)

[first item in your case selected all the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m35s)

[way through.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m37s)

[What I am kind of interested in seeing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m38s)

[is where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m41s)

[if there is a and actually maybe that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m44s)

[the thing to search here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m46s)

[because a tab strip placement is not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m49s)

[going to be a common thing in this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m51s)

[repository.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m54s)

[So I'm curious](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h28m56s)

[tab strip placement.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m00s)

[Uh let's see. Show 68 more matches. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m04s)

[we'll grab that one there and go take a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m07s)

[look cuz what I'm looking for is an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m09s)

[immediate relative source binding](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m12s)

[and we'll grab that one there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m15s)

[So, show me your tab strip placement.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m19s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m26s)

[That's incredibly suspicious to me. fact](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m29s)

[that that guy has commented out almost](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m33s)

[like somebody found this bug blame.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m36s)

[When was that line changed?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m41s)

[Oh, this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m45s)

[five years ago. So, this is okay. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m47s)

[maybe we don't get too too attached to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m50s)

[that one just yet.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m52s)

[Okay. There. There. There.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m55s)

[No. No. No. Is it just those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h29m58s)

[tab placement relative source ancestor](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m05s)

[type tab control? Does that match what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m09s)

[we saw? Ancestor type tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m10s)

[element type tab item. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m16s)

[So what is the trigger on here? Mouse](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m20s)

[over](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m23s)

[those.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m25s)

[shouldn't be mattering. So, it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m27s)

[reaching up trying to grab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m29s)

[the first tab control item.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m34s)

[I bet you it's the unload.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m43s)

[I bet you that's what it is. Um, here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m46s)

[let's test the theory. So, if I go here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m50s)

[right, and I Let's see. Minimize this. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m53s)

[go B](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m55s)

[and then click over to Caha,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h30m59s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m03s)

[right? And if I go C back to B, I get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m05s)

[four of them. But if I go bing bing bing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m08s)

[bing and then click up, I get nothing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m11s)

[If I go bing bing bing bing, click over,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m14s)

[nothing. If I go A and I click just two,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m18s)

[right? And then I clear this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m22s)

[I suspect I should only get either two](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m25s)

[or three depending on how many I've](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m27s)

[already toggled.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m28s)

[I got them all.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m30s)

[Okay. Content presenter middleman](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m35s)

[because of data template. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m38s)

[Victor, I'm you're not far off. The](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m41s)

[thing is the data template is going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m47s)

[give me a separate parent tab view](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m49s)

[instance. So I've got one tab control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m52s)

[here with separate user controls](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h31m55s)

[because these are all going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m00s)

[separate child instances](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m02s)

[and then main tab window. Yeah. So that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m09s)

[I don't see a problem. But my theory is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m13s)

[that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m17s)

[these things, these secondary tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m18s)

[controls exist and because let me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m21s)

[restart this. I want to test that theory](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m24s)

[out. I'm guessing because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m26s)

[um because you'll note content isn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m29s)

[instantiated until a tab is selected. It](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m31s)

[does it for performance. So it's lazily](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m33s)

[instantiated, right? And so we know if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m35s)

[we toggle over one, two, if I click](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m38s)

[here, I expect to see two errors.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m42s)

[None.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m47s)

[Interesting. And if I go here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m50s)

[four or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m53s)

[here, four or I do that and click over.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h32m55s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m01s)

[So, as soon as I move it, and maybe this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m03s)

[is why that selected item binding is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m05s)

[fixing it, is because it's forcing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m08s)

[it's forcing one item selected.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m13s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m18s)

[I wonder](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m21s)

[I wonder does tab control because tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m23s)

[control derives from selector, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m26s)

[But I'm wondering if it actually handles](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m28s)

[doing the selection itself.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m32s)

[Um, let's see. Uninitialized.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m37s)

[Let's go. We We literally have the code](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m42s)

[sitting right over here. Um, if I look](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m44s)

[at tab control,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m49s)

[just right here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m54s)

[right? because I it seems like it's the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h33m57s)

[the lack of those UI elements being](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m00s)

[rendered that's triggering this. But I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m03s)

[am wondering if there is something the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m06s)

[tab control is hijacking which is why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m08s)

[the selected item binding because me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m11s)

[clicking on a different tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m13s)

[immediately changes something selected](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m17s)

[content internal set. Aha](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m20s)

[that gives me a lot of caution](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m25s)

[that whenever I see those kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m31s)

[internal sets it immediately makes me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m33s)

[question what's going on. Change visual](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m35s)

[state that doesn't give me any](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m38s)

[scariness.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m40s)

[Status change can select multiple](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m43s)

[on apply template update selected](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m47s)

[content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m49s)

[on selection changed actually that's one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m52s)

[other thing I want I didn't see what is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m55s)

[the because you're doing the selection](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h34m58s)

[all in the constructor](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m00s)

[at least for the children](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m02s)

[right so this is set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m05s)

[before any binding occurs so by the time](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m08s)

[we get to here this guy is already set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m10s)

[all the way in.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m13s)

[On selection changed,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m18s)

[framework selection properties can lag](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m21s)

[behind selection changed event.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m24s)

[Boy, that's a heck of a switch.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m27s)

[Uh, let's see. Old useless behavior](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m33s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m39s)

[sets the focus.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m42s)

[But the thing is this would be done](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m45s)

[when selection change default behavior](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m49s)

[to raise the selection event. The inputs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m50s)

[fires.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h35m58s)

[Sorry, just got a notification that my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m05s)

[There we go. Okay. Apparently my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m14s)

[charging cable pulled out on it. So move](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m16s)

[that. So I stopped kicking it with my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m18s)

[start index find next tab item.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m25s)

[This only occurs when you're removing an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m33s)

[item from its bound collection](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m35s)

[which we are. But we should never be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m38s)

[triggering that code path](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m39s)

[item selected get selected tab. I am](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m42s)

[wondering so I agree with you H that it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m47s)

[looks like a WPF bug.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m50s)

[I am somewhat suspicious](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m53s)

[I am somewhat suspicious of these calls](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h36m59s)

[here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m02s)

[specifically this one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m06s)

[because this is going to go through and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m13s)

[do a lot of work in here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m15s)

[because it gets the selected tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m22s)

[gets the visual parent of the tab.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m26s)

[I don't understand why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m32s)

[selected content template. So, I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m36s)

[restart one more time. I want to try one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m39s)

[more thing before I get too distracted.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m41s)

[Then I'm going to circle back. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m43s)

[so I want to look at this in Snoop and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m47s)

[watch these selected properties before](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m49s)

[Oh, I've already got Snoop open. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m53s)

[before and after selecting this knowing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m56s)

[what that thing's looking for.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h37m59s)

[I am I am suspicious.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m02s)

[Uh let's see. So if I go here, right,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m06s)

[and then I grab the tab control and I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m08s)

[going to go with selected.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m09s)

[So those things are all set from the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m16s)

[local source.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m18s)

[Interesting. And so when I click here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m22s)

[selected content goes into there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m29s)

[And then if I look](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m33s)

[going to lurk while I go enjoy smoke.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m36s)

[Sounds good. Um, and if I look at this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m39s)

[tab control here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m42s)

[and same thing. It's set up basically](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m45s)

[the same way, though.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m49s)

[Except for that's a local binding is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m52s)

[key difference.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m55s)

[Whereas this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h38m58s)

[selected index has a value and it's set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m05s)

[versus this tab control here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m10s)

[default default.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m20s)

[And so then when I click](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m24s)

[because this guy here when I look at the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m29s)

[individual tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m32s)

[what's really interesting to me here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m36s)

[that of what I don't see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m39s)

[Maybe I don't expect it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m48s)

[because from the tab control I expect to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m51s)

[see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m53s)

[a root grid,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m56s)

[right? Selected content host](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h39m59s)

[and then the individual content. And I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m06s)

[guess I do see the thing same thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m08s)

[Root grid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m10s)

[content panel selected content host and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m12s)

[then the individual content. In this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m15s)

[case, a text block](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m16s)

[potential binding links](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m28s)

[found one time causing a binding leak.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m33s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m35s)

[is it just a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m41s)

[binding leak problem?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m43s)

[So the binding link here is occurring](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m49s)

[because your view models don't implement](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m52s)

[I notify property change and so the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m54s)

[binding ends up having to wrap it un](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h40m56s)

[somewhat unnecessarily. The other way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m00s)

[you change this is you set the mode on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m03s)

[your bindings to uh one time and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m05s)

[it'll it'll just read the property. in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m09s)

[order for it to know when the property](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m11s)

[changes or to have some semblance of it,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m13s)

[you end up with this binding leak](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m15s)

[problem. I don't know that that's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m18s)

[cause](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m21s)

[of this, but it makes me suspicious.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m23s)

[It makes me suspicious.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m29s)

[Then freezable stuff, which those are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m34s)

[not. Uh, get rid of those. So there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m36s)

[only those binding warnings.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m39s)

[Um Hessen, can you try converting your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m45s)

[view models to actually implement I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m49s)

[notify property change and make these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m51s)

[things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m53s)

[actually maybe I'll just do it real](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m55s)

[quick.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m56s)

[I'll just do it real quick. So now now](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h41m58s)

[I'm now I'm confused and I don't like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m00s)

[being confused.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m02s)

[Um let's see here. So browse](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m04s)

[DVM toolkit.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m08s)

[That guy. Oh, we've already got it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m13s)

[included. Excellent. Excellent.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m14s)

[Excellent. Wait,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m17s)

[I've seen this before. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m21s)

[so if I just go here and go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m24s)

[observable](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m28s)

[Come on. Come on. Find it. Thank you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m33s)

[And then we make you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m38s)

[I don't know that this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m44s)

[full solution but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m46s)

[serable property](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m48s)

[this latest I think it's I think it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m51s)

[latest.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m53s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m55s)

[then this needs to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h42m58s)

[partial.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m01s)

[We're going to fix that binding link of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m19s)

[the name with just changing the mode.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m21s)

[Um, oh, but this guy we are just using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m25s)

[display member path. So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m28s)

[fix this one here by doing the same](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m31s)

[thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m33s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m35s)

[if I just go partial and observable](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m37s)

[property.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m42s)

[Uh, oh, you probably need a setter.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m45s)

[Here we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m53s)

[And then this guy here, we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m56s)

[do the same thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h43m58s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m01s)

[observable property and then we'll make](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m06s)

[you a partial](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m08s)

[then we'll make you derive from](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m11s)

[booyah](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m17s)

[okay I am curious if this makes any](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m19s)

[difference](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m22s)

[only because there's pizza will be a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m28s)

[You too, Izzy. You too as well.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m36s)

[Okay, so we're going to go here. Pin](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m40s)

[clean](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m44s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m47s)

[There. No dice.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m49s)

[So, did it resolve the binding leak? I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m53s)

[guess is the question.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h44m56s)

[Yeah, binding leaks are gone but no](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m00s)

[change.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m02s)

[Yeah. So, no change there. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m11s)

[I created parent tabs manually to fix](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m16s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m18s)

[It's interesting that creating a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m25s)

[manually fixes it. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m27s)

[I would tell you tell you, Hen, to open](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m32s)

[up an issue on the WPF repository](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m34s)

[because you've got a a beautiful sample](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m39s)

[here showing exactly how to recreate the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m41s)

[problem.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m43s)

[Um, and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m45s)

[shoot me the link because I'd like to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m50s)

[follow it because I I I I agree that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m51s)

[this looks a heck of a lot like a WPF](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m53s)

[issue. I'm just s I I'm a bit surprised](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h45m56s)

[and I don't know.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m00s)

[I I have to believe it's going to end up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m02s)

[being related to the timing of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m04s)

[selected item.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m07s)

[And and by timing I mean the fact that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m09s)

[we're setting this property immediately](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m12s)

[rather than later.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m15s)

[And so something about those child tabs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m18s)

[aren't being fully instantiated](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m20s)

[because clicking through them fixes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m23s)

[fixes the issue. So I think there must](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m26s)

[be something about that initial state of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m28s)

[the tab control when you set that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m30s)

[selected item that doesn't fully](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m32s)

[initialize it in the same way as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m35s)

[clicking onto one of the tabs. because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m37s)

[as soon as you click onto a tab, the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m39s)

[issue goes away. So there has to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m41s)

[something different about the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m44s)

[initialization of it. Right? So if I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m45s)

[click here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m48s)

[right, I've now clicked on child three,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m50s)

[no air, but on parent B.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m54s)

[There we go. Okay. Is it this one?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h46m59s)

[Finding air for tab control.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m03s)

[Oh boy. Oh boy. Let's hope not because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m06s)

[that's disconcerting. Um, does this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m09s)

[reproduce?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m12s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m15s)

[find ancestor.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m19s)

[This is a different binding expression](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m24s)

[path. So, I'm going to go with no](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m26s)

[Yeah, I think this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m39s)

[this is potentially related, but the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m44s)

[fact that this has relative bindings to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m46s)

[this person's own app is probably why it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m49s)

[was flagged as needs more info](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m54s)

[because this is also their their](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h47m57s)

[through the tab. tab control where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m02s)

[they're specifying the tab items whereas](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m04s)

[So they may end up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m11s)

[uh they may end up being similar root](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m16s)

[causes because they both are going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m18s)

[bubble up through the same visual tree](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m19s)

[past that tab control. But um given how](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m21s)

[old this is and the fact that the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m25s)

[binding expression doesn't match, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m26s)

[would say different issue.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m28s)

[That would be my my assessment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m30s)

[Yeah, I would probably file one and see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m35s)

[what they say. Um, the I will say the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m39s)

[WPF team is small. I think it's like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m42s)

[four. So, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m45s)

[it's also around holiday time, so I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m49s)

[would not be surprised if they don't get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m52s)

[back until January. So, I'll just throw](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m54s)

[that out there. I don't know what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m57s)

[people's schedules are. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h48m58s)

[okay. Uh, let's see. So, we want a new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m02s)

[one here. And we are going to be we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m06s)

[going to call this thing like start app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m09s)

[I am a little curious if I can do this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m13s)

[as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m16s)

[I kind of want to Well, actually, you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m20s)

[know what I want to do? I want to test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m21s)

[something first because so much of my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m23s)

[stuff is asynchronous. Can I get away](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m25s)

[with this? I like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m28s)

[um so await task delay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m31s)

[Uh let's make it long enough to where I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m38s)

[can tell that it's doing something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m40s)

[right. Yeah. Don't co-pilot, stop it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m42s)

[We're going to rebuild](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m46s)

[and see if I get blocked on the output.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m48s)

[Yeah. See, this is why it's important to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m51s)

[know about this because the server over](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m53s)

[here, stop it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m55s)

[locking it and once you stop it,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h49m59s)

[shockingly it can then copy the output](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m02s)

[directory. There we go. So, we will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m03s)

[restart the server](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m06s)

[and it should come up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m09s)

[and we're going to we're going to come](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m12s)

[back here and we're just going to rerun](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m14s)

[from this point.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m15s)

[Generate random number.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m19s)

[Your random number is 23. I think that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m24s)

[was fiveish seconds.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m26s)

[Let me let me open up my clock. I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m28s)

[to I want to just confirm that this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m31s)

[in fact going slow.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m33s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m37s)

[come here. Come here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m41s)

[One](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m48s)

[there. Yeah. About fiveish seconds.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m50s)

[Okay. So we can so we can make things](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m53s)

[async. Great. That's all I needed to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m55s)

[confirm. Thank you. Okay. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h50m58s)

[just going to do task for now. Start](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m04s)

[app. And we need so in this case the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m06s)

[setup we're going for is we want to give](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m10s)

[ourselves a tool about run in app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m13s)

[or run ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m19s)

[snippet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m22s)

[in app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m24s)

[Just trying to think of what exactly I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m28s)

[want this to end up looking like because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m30s)

[ultimately I want this to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m32s)

[We we have to do something akin to this,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m37s)

[right? Is we need to do setting up this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m39s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m44s)

[forgot to stop my timer and so it was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m46s)

[dingying in my ears. Um, and then create](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m48s)

[window with like we basically want to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m50s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m52s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h51m55s)

[and we're going to have to give back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m05s)

[some sort of like app identifier. We](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m06s)

[could do a process ID or similar.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m09s)

[Um, but we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m12s)

[start with something like this. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m14s)

[and then I should be able to take my MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m19s)

[and add a project reference.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m22s)

[Add project reference to ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m25s)

[And that should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m30s)

[get me access to all the fun stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m33s)

[All right. What are you going to squawk](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m38s)

[about?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m40s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m42s)

[oh, because it wants Windows and this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m45s)

[thing is very much not.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m48s)

[Uh, so one, we can turn off](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m51s)

[these guys](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m56s)

[to begin with.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h52m58s)

[I don't know if that will preclude it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m03s)

[from being What is your problem here?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m05s)

[Like to see what that warning is.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m09s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m12s)

[let's comment this out for a minute.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m16s)

[Uh, return task complete a task.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m19s)

[Just want to get you compiling first.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m23s)

[Project is not compatible with net 10.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m26s)

[Oh, because this guy isn't Windows.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m30s)

[I should be able to do that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m36s)

[solve the first problem](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m40s)

[uh is not a self-contained executable.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m44s)

[See a nonself-containing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m48s)

[You can't reference a library.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m54s)

[No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h53m57s)

[Uh, copy. Give me that error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m01s)

[I want to go to that link. What is that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m06s)

[error? trying to tell me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m09s)

[Zaml test is a nonself-contained](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m12s)

[executable. A nonself-contained](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m16s)

[executable cannot be referenced by a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m17s)

[self-contained executable.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m20s)

[But do I need to flag it as such?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m25s)

[Because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m29s)

[if the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m35s)

[so this guy so I guess the question is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m39s)

[where is self-contained](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m43s)

[that to be self-contained applicant does](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m45s)

[not rely on a shared framework in this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m47s)

[case I think we turn that off](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m51s)

[and confirm that it still works](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h54m56s)

[cut.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m01s)

[So, we've got that going.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m03s)

[Stop the server here. Let's rebuild](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m08s)

[this. And then I want to see this thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m11s)

[work](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m14s)

[because I would like to know that it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m16s)

[I would like to see it actually go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m25s)

[through and do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m27s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m31s)

[Oh, we got a bunch of warnings in here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m33s)

[Oh, probably from updating the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m37s)

[I think I fixed these on on my other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m41s)

[branch. That's fine. I just need to get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m43s)

[that other branch merged. Uh, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m46s)

[we go back here, then restart the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m50s)

[server,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m54s)

[and then we're going to just go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m56s)

[Give me another random number for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h55m58s)

[moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m00s)

[And that seems to be fine. and it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m02s)

[doesn't care.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m05s)

[Oh, looks like there was an error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m07s)

[You like a random number generated using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m10s)

[standard C# code? No. I would like you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m12s)

[to shut up and tell me what the error](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m14s)

[was.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m16s)

[Unable to copy to undefined](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m22s)

[me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m30s)

[So, this guy here. So whenever you see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m32s)

[this type of undefined, this is an MS](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m36s)

[build thing where it is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m39s)

[um it's it's way of uh indicating that a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m43s)

[variable isn't there. But I have some MS](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m46s)

[build tasks](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m49s)

[for example solution directory](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m56s)

[because what is this copying? copy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h56m59s)

[outputs after build.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m01s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m05s)

[so let's do this. Let's just condition](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m07s)

[it for the moment. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m09s)

[solution dur](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m12s)

[not equal to empty string. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m16s)

[and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m21s)

[solution dur](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m24s)

[not equal to star undefined star](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m28s)

[and then close tick and we need to put](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m34s)

[these guys in ticks here and here and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m37s)

[here. There. I think that will fix that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m43s)

[problem.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m46s)

[because now it'll just skip this copy. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m48s)

[because I don't believe I need this copy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m50s)

[for the MCP. I just need to reference](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m52s)

[the DLL.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h57m54s)

[Yeah, I'm trying to remember why this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m03s)

[even in here. I know I needed this for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m05s)

[Nougat package creation, but I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m08s)

[remember why. Um, so let's just restart](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m10s)

[then.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m15s)

[claims to be running. Let's execute](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m19s)

[initialize handler blah blah blah. Did](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m34s)

[the thing got a random number. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m36s)

[Okay, so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m38s)

[that gets us back to there. So now I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m41s)

[should have access to my APIs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m43s)

[which we do. So we can now make you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m47s)

[async do the needful right and so we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m49s)

[will do we're not going to do our log](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m52s)

[message I think we're just going to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m55s)

[console right line here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m57s)

[I believe that outputs and then we want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h58m59s)

[to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m03s)

[uh the ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m06s)

[snippet to render in a new WPF window](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m10s)

[uh uh string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m19s)

[demo snippet and we are not going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m23s)

[make this optional. We are going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m26s)

[require it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m27s)

[We're going to do that. We're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m30s)

[do that and then we will initialize here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m31s)

[and then we will do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m36s)

[bar window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m40s)

[So why do you not have initialize with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m42s)

[defaults? Where does that exist? That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m44s)

[probably actually something I defined in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m47s)

[my test app,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m49s)

[isn't it? It](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m54s)

[uh no, this is inside of ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=01h59m57s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m05s)

[do I am I just missing the using? Yep.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m07s)

[I get away with it in my test project](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m12s)

[without the using because my test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m14s)

[project is in the right name space. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m16s)

[that gets me there. Um let's see. Get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m19s)

[executing assembly.loation.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m22s)

[Um, I don't know that I need this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m25s)

[initialize with defaults because this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m34s)

[one is going to pull in.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m37s)

[I don't think I because that would grab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m41s)

[my MCP server DL and I don't think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m43s)

[that's the one that I want. And then I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m46s)

[going to do var window create window](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m49s)

[with content. And then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m51s)

[zaml snippet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m54s)

[because this will actually show the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h00m58s)

[window and do the needful. That should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m00s)

[get us](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m03s)

[an actual window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m06s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m09s)

[start app with zaml snippet. I'm going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m15s)

[to This is one of those cases where I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m19s)

[probably going to play around with this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m20s)

[for a bit and find a a good use. So, let](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m22s)

[me do there. And then I'm going to come](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m24s)

[here and I'm going to stop the server so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m26s)

[it shuts up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m28s)

[And then once that build completes here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m30s)

[Great. We're going to come back here. We](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m33s)

[are going to start.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m35s)

[And I think we're going to need to just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m38s)

[update the tools on here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m40s)

[uh tools more.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m44s)

[Oh, it's not finding the tool because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m49s)

[didn't include it. So, back in our](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m51s)

[program CS, the way you bring in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m55s)

[tools,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m57s)

[you can either do with tools here like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h01m58s)

[this or you can do with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m01s)

[um tools from assembly,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m04s)

[right? And so it just kind of uh uses](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m08s)

[reflection to to rip through and find](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m11s)

[everything that's decorated](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m13s)

[appropriately because I believe it calls](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m14s)

[out it is looking for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m17s)

[yeah specifi specified assembly or the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m20s)

[calling assembly if one is provided for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m23s)

[classes marked with the MCP tool](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m25s)

[attribute and then discovers methods in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m28s)

[there marked with the tool uh attribute](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m31s)

[and registers them in the service](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m35s)

[collection. So, rips through all of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m37s)

[those. Should find Oh, but it wanted](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m40s)

[CLA. It said with classes with it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m44s)

[or classes marked with MCP server tool](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m48s)

[type. Got it. So, I got to just decorate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m52s)

[this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m55s)

[MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m57s)

[server tool type there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h02m58s)

[We'll do the same thing up here, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m01s)

[And then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m04s)

[I may go back to just explicitly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m06s)

[registering it because I I and maybe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m08s)

[it's a bad assumption, but I suspect](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m11s)

[it's using reflection](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m13s)

[to do it. Uh oh, I just tried to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m18s)

[f it and that's not going to work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m22s)

[Oh, could not copy. Stop the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m25s)

[Could complete the build. Great. And in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m30s)

[fact, I shouldn't need to worry about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m33s)

[the build because the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m35s)

[the only reason it's trying to compile](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m38s)

[like this will the net run will try to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m40s)

[compile if necessary. It if you do the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m42s)

[d-n no build it will go through and do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m44s)

[it. Let's see in YouTube video. Uh oh.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m47s)

[What am I about to run into? Hess.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m53s)

[Oh boy. Uh oh. I recognize this guy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h03m58s)

[I recognize this guy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m04s)

[Oh boy. Oh boy. I have a feeling there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m10s)

[going to be a question of f uh let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m13s)

[see. Um let's see. I found two of your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m15s)

[videos where you are teaching custom](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m18s)

[controls. Are there any more that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m20s)

[missed? Um the only other ones that are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m21s)

[worth if you are interested in custom](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m25s)

[control building, there's a deep um list](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m27s)

[if you look for the multi select tree](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m32s)

[view videos. Um I can grab them for you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m34s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m40s)

[yeah. So, there are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m45s)

[if you just search for tree view on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m50s)

[mine,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m52s)

[there's there's a there's like five](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m54s)

[parts of these. So, this is building out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h04m57s)

[my multi select tree view. I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m00s)

[there's probably a handful of other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m02s)

[videos where I chase down bugs related](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m03s)

[to it, but these are the specific ones](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m05s)

[around building it. So, the multi select](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m07s)

[tree view is arguably one of the most](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m10s)

[complicated components I have ever](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m12s)

[built.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m14s)

[Um, but I I needed it and there wasn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m16s)

[good ones out there that were in any](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m19s)

[open source library. So, I built one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m21s)

[Um, I modeled it roughly after the tree](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m25s)

[view inside of the test explore. So the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m29s)

[test explorer here in Visual Studio,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m33s)

[this is not, despite what this looks](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m36s)

[like, this is not a tree view. This is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m38s)

[list view that's set to look like a tree](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m41s)

[view. Um, and so I built mine somewhat](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m44s)

[based upon the idea behind this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m48s)

[Um because I I'd been poking around at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m52s)

[the this element with Snoop and I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m56s)

[noticed how it was structured and so I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h05m58s)

[went, "Oh, okay. We can do this with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m00s)

[tree views and dynamically adding and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m03s)

[loading them." So if you are if you want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m04s)

[to run down the rabbit hole of custom](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m06s)

[control building, that one will show you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m09s)

[just how deep the uh the rabbit goes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m11s)

[Um, okay. So, now we've got two tools.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m20s)

[Great. Um, show me this ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m22s)

[uh in a new window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m29s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m33s)

[ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m35s)

[uh let's see button content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m40s)

[testing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m45s)

[Okay, this works. I become very very](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m49s)

[happy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m52s)

[It's calling the right code. It's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m56s)

[passing the right value.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h06m58s)

[We're going to hit allow. I probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m01s)

[should have always allowed it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m02s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m07s)

[I love it. I love it so much. I love it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m12s)

[so much. Oh, I love it. Oh, I'm very,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m15s)

[very happy. Oh. Oh. Okay. Proof of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m18s)

[concept is in the bank. Now, now we go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m22s)

[crazy. Okay. So, we're going to whack](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m24s)

[the random number. Nobody cares about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m28s)

[random numbers. That is That is not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m29s)

[interesting. This is what is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m31s)

[interesting. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m32s)

[the question becomes, what capabilities](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m34s)

[do we really want to give our agent to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m38s)

[be able to do? Because I would like it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m40s)

[to be able to take](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m42s)

[snippets of ZAML, be able to pop a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m44s)

[window and be able to act on those to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m47s)

[figure out how ZAML code is working,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m50s)

[right? Because one of the biggest](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m54s)

[limitations right now with like the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m55s)

[coding agent is when you have Windows](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h07m58s)

[specific like WPF controls because it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m02s)

[can't like launch it and look at it the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m05s)

[same way it can with web-based stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m07s)

[because playright and simple browser](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m09s)

[give capabilities to Copilot to be able](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m11s)

[to visually inspect it. It doesn't know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m13s)

[how to do the same thing with WPF. This](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m16s)

[could give it similar capabilities. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m19s)

[makes me happy. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m22s)

[I might have to build something to let](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m25s)

[it Well, so okay. Okay. Okay. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m27s)

[MC uh P server tool. So I want to give](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m31s)

[it I need to keep track of how many apps](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m36s)

[I start because this is going to do a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m40s)

[process start and I need to keep I need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m42s)

[to keep a hold of these things because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m45s)

[if I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m48s)

[I am going to end up leaking like a civ.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m50s)

[So I need to hold let's let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h08m57s)

[what is the e because I could always](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m02s)

[query the processes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m04s)

[That's a thing that I could do that way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m07s)

[I don't have to worry about the running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m09s)

[state of my server. That might be best.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m11s)

[That might be the path of least](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m18s)

[resistance.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m20s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m22s)

[let's return back an int.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m24s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m27s)

[uh, let's see. And I'm going to change](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m30s)

[this out for something. I want a a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m33s)

[multi-line string literal. We're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m37s)

[to do this. That way I can that way I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m39s)

[can do fanciness. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m42s)

[yeah. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m48s)

[returns the PID of the started](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m54s)

[application there. That way, if we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h09m59s)

[return that, that gives Copilot enough](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m01s)

[information to terminate it if it if it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m03s)

[wants or needs to. That is, I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m06s)

[critical. So we need to return app dot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m09s)

[and then this is where I don't know that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m13s)

[I actually expose it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m15s)

[but as the author of the library I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m18s)

[make my library do whatever I want. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m22s)

[okay so start remote](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m25s)

[there's the start info. Where did the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m28s)

[start info get put?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m30s)

[because it's the start info launches](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m34s)

[adds our current running process ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m40s)

[because this is the weird part right is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m43s)

[it adds in the process ID because it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m45s)

[assumes that the caller of this is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m48s)

[unit test runner that's the weird part](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m50s)

[like it's kind of a we're we're we're in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m53s)

[this case the process ID of what's going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m56s)

[to be starting this is an MCP client](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h10m58s)

[right so it's going to be it's going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m01s)

[be a little wacky. Um, we're never going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m03s)

[to use](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m07s)

[this these options here. So, maybe we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m10s)

[should actually be real explicit about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m14s)

[our options that we're going to do. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m16s)

[rather than just log message, let's do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m19s)

[do new app options because I I feel like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m23s)

[I want to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m26s)

[I want to be real explicit on some of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m28s)

[these things. So, log message can be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m30s)

[console right line. That's fine. Allow](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m31s)

[Visual Studio Debugger detach false](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m34s)

[because we are never going to be in a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m36s)

[state where that do that. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m38s)

[we don't ever want to minimize other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m45s)

[windows. That would be a bad horrible](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m48s)

[idea.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m51s)

[And then we could just set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m53s)

[path. But I don't think I care. What is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m56s)

[application type?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h11m58s)

[What is application type used for?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m01s)

[I wrote this library and I don't know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m04s)

[what this is.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m06s)

[It specifies d- application type.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m11s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m17s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m19s)

[What is app type used for?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m22s)

[So the run command](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m27s)

[app type value](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m30s)

[create from assembly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m32s)

[application type.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m34s)

[Oh, this is the actual type of the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m39s)

[Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m42s)

[Got it. Got it. This is the application](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m43s)

[type. I realize I've just said the same](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m45s)

[word multiple times. I shall explain.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m47s)

[Inside of a WPF app, you have your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m50s)

[app.zaml and that has a type that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m52s)

[tied to your application. it derives](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m54s)

[from the uh system windows.lication](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h12m57s)

[class but the actual app.zaml type will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m00s)

[be a type in your project itself.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m03s)

[So it it literally is type of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m08s)

[application. So okay, probably should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m10s)

[have documented these. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m13s)

[add that to Copilot's list of things I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m16s)

[going to have it do later. That one I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m18s)

[don't think we care about because we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m21s)

[want to generate it. But I still have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m22s)

[the issue of after I start this process,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m26s)

[what do I do with the process start? So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m29s)

[this guy waits for a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m32s)

[he opens a name pipe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m36s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m39s)

[creates an app. The app wait calls get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m42s)

[version, iterates that back, waits for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m46s)

[the thing to start. This guy here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m50s)

[what actually is being returned. But you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m52s)

[don't you have the process inside of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m55s)

[here, but you don't expose it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h13m58s)

[Do I just add it to I app?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m02s)

[Um, it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m07s)

[probably not a bad idea.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m10s)

[Like it it's intentionally disposable](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m13s)

[and that that terminates the process.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m15s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m20s)

[uh, okay. So, I'm I'm torn between a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m29s)

[couple things. Option one, I just slap a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m31s)

[process ID on the end of this and call](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m34s)

[it a day. Option two, I do something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m35s)

[more like Aspire where they were a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m38s)

[little more generic where we can pull](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m39s)

[like attributes off of this sucker, but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m41s)

[then I have to do like a whole](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m43s)

[attributes thing. I think in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m44s)

[interest of simplicity](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m46s)

[um int process ID right we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m49s)

[do that um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m53s)

[the ID of the process that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h14m58s)

[the application is running in that'll](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m05s)

[work](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m09s)

[okay so that will give us there and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m14s)

[we just go process ID. Boom. Problem](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m16s)

[solved. Right? So that will that will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m18s)

[handle that. And now I just have to deal](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m22s)

[with the inevitable](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m23s)

[error of internal app doesn't implement](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m25s)

[process ID.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m29s)

[Oh, we can make these static I guess. No](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m31s)

[harm in that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m35s)

[Okay, that gets me there. interface and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m42s)

[then I think what we might well I guess](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m45s)

[it doesn't really matter since this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m48s)

[an internal class it's not going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m50s)

[exposed much process ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m52s)

[um I do worry that I might need to try](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h15m57s)

[catch this because I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m00s)

[yeah it throws invalid operation](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m04s)

[exception and I assume when the process](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m06s)

[hasn't been started or otherwise](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m09s)

[uh has not been set or there is no](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m11s)

[process associated with this diagnostic](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m14s)

[process. Yeah, see this is what I was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m16s)

[worried uh see all this stuff all this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m17s)

[stuff I'm going to end up implementing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m21s)

[half of what I was trying to avoid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m23s)

[anyway. Uh try](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m24s)

[um nope that is not even close. Uh catch](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m28s)

[operation canceled or not uh invalid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m35s)

[valid operation exception and then we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m42s)

[are going to turn minus one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m45s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m50s)

[there we go. That should be good enough.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m53s)

[So now if I have Copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h16m59s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m03s)

[and launch, I should be able to have it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m05s)

[launch and then as long as I'm in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m08s)

[same chat session, I should be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m10s)

[have it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m12s)

[do the thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m15s)

[I can probably just clear this output so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m17s)

[so I don't have to do all this every](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m19s)

[time. I discovered one tool. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m20s)

[We're going to come up here. We're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m23s)

[to do this guy. Send it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m24s)

[And then we are going to always allow](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m30s)

[because it's my tool. Darn it. I trust](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m32s)

[my own thing. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m34s)

[Great. Uh, shut down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m38s)

[the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m42s)

[Uh, if you need to.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m46s)

[Yeah, it will close automatically. No,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m50s)

[it won't. No, it won't. I have to close](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m52s)

[it, but that's okay. Okay. So, we've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m55s)

[we've got some work to do there. Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h17m58s)

[give it some more capabilities.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m00s)

[Um, I would like to be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m03s)

[I think do I want do I want to give it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m08s)

[some way of rendering the visual tree?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m12s)

[I feel like I want to give it some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m16s)

[visual tree representation.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m18s)

[Well, let let's start let's start with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m20s)

[this. start with this uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m26s)

[visual element tools, right? We're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m28s)

[to do this next. We're going to move](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m31s)

[uh move to visual element tools and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m36s)

[we're going to rename the class up here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m38s)

[to be app tools from the random one. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m40s)

[rename file to app tools. Great. This](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m43s)

[guy goes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m47s)

[Oh, nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Sync. Sync](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m48s)

[me up. Visual element tools. Okay. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m51s)

[update](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h18m58s)

[app ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m03s)

[updates the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m06s)

[only](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m14s)

[processes started with well we'll leave](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m16s)

[it at that for now. So this guy here uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m20s)

[description](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m24s)

[the uh PID of the running app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m27s)

[So int process id uh the zaml](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m41s)

[to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m43s)

[set as the windows content.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m45s)

[Okay. So we aren't going to do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m51s)

[What I kind of want to do is app dot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h19m55s)

[because I I need the ability to not just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m00s)

[start but to attach to it. This is why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m02s)

[I'm wondering if I need to separate out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m06s)

[and have something in the middle that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m10s)

[can play controller for this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m13s)

[because this guy could](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m16s)

[Because there's no real](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m25s)

[actually I guess what we could do. Does](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m29s)

[this guy have any sort of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m32s)

[configure container login services?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m36s)

[I don't want to handle](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m42s)

[uh let's see. Let's let's let's break](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m47s)

[these up. Let's break these up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m49s)

[bar app,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m52s)

[right? And then we're going to come down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m54s)

[here. Oh, wait. App dot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m55s)

[But I believe that I can do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h20m59s)

[app dot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m03s)

[because the run async is just a wrapper](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m11s)

[around the other calls. So, I think I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m15s)

[could just do a start and then a wait](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m18s)

[for exit and then.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m20s)

[Yeah, this guy here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m26s)

[Because I think what we could do is we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m30s)

[could actually start this guy up and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m32s)

[have and because he's a long running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m34s)

[process, we could actually hold on to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m36s)

[the reference to the apps and then we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m39s)

[could control starting and stopping](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m41s)

[them. I think that might be better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m43s)

[rather than having just passing the pits](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m45s)

[back.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m48s)

[Effectively, let this let the MCP um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m53s)

[client play the same role as the unit](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h21m57s)

[test project would.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m02s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m04s)

[because I think that makes my life a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m07s)

[little bit easier](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m10s)

[cuz this is really just a using around](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m12s)

[the host and then followed by](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m15s)

[wait for shutdown](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m20s)

[and then we can just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m25s)

[there there is a shutdown.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m29s)

[I have one more silly WPF question. No](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m31s)

[such thing as a silly question. Fire](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m34s)

[away, Hess.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m35s)

[I think I can just shut it down here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m39s)

[though, can't I?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m41s)

[I think I can. And actually, I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m46s)

[what I can do is uh public class](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m50s)

[app service manager. I want to try this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h22m55s)

[Um, I async disposable,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m00s)

[right? I want to move you out. Come on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m04s)

[Come on. Auto code, do the thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m08s)

[There we go. Um, I don't know why you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m13s)

[were slow there. Uh, let's see. I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m15s)

[to put you in the name space because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m18s)

[you're not a top level statement.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m20s)

[Change to namespace. Nope. Do it this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m22s)

[way. I async disposable implement](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m25s)

[interface and so what I think I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m29s)

[do is public or uh private list](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m32s)

[I want to want a set of apps](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m39s)

[dictionary app I don't know string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m43s)

[running apps](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m48s)

[We'll do we'll do something like that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m56s)

[Let's see. Is there a way to bind the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h23m58s)

[duration property of animations inside](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m01s)

[of a visual state group to a dependency](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m03s)

[property defined in the control? I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m06s)

[to update the duration from the view](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m08s)

[model and I'm doing it this way.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m10s)

[So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m14s)

[not uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m20s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m25s)

[the speed property.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m27s)

[Yeah, because I assume if I if I look at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m36s)

[this guy here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m40s)

[uh, you've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m42s)

[Oh, you don't have the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m45s)

[Oh, you're doing it in the call back of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m49s)

[the property. Uh, let's see here. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m50s)

[state change property call back.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m53s)

[This guy go to state.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h24m56s)

[Well, that's a state on speed property](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m04s)

[change call back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m06s)

[update visual state durations get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m08s)

[template child. Oh, and then ripping](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m11s)

[through this guy. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m13s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m18s)

[finding the visual state manager get the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m19s)

[visual state iterating through. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m21s)

[the short answer is there of no because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m26s)

[it's not bindable. there's not a way to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m31s)

[do it. The reason it's not bindable is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m33s)

[because bindings may update as the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m36s)

[result of an animation and they really](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m38s)

[want animations to be uh frozen and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m40s)

[immutable. Now, in cases like this,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m43s)

[there's often times where it's like,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m46s)

[yeah, I realize that, but I still want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m48s)

[some configuration bit. And you end up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m50s)

[doing something of this nature. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m52s)

[should be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m54s)

[I don't know that you need to go through](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m58s)

[and grab it. Uh um do you have your uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h25m59s)

[template for this checked in somewhere?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m04s)

[Because oftentimes you can still give](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m06s)

[that a name.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m08s)

[Uh le sorry resources led style. There](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m11s)

[we go. Found it. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m14s)

[because you're already grabbing the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m22s)

[visual state manager. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m24s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m27s)

[So, what you can do is you can pull your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m30s)

[um your storyboard out of the visual](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m35s)

[state manager up to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m38s)

[um a resource on like grid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m42s)

[and reference it that way because then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m46s)

[you end up with the storyboard inside](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m49s)

[because you don't really want to pull](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m51s)

[your storyboard up to the top level](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m53s)

[resource dictionary because that exposes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m54s)

[it to everything and this is really](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m56s)

[something tightly coupled to this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m57s)

[particular control. Um but you can go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h26m59s)

[through and put a resource on grid or um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m03s)

[set the uh resource dictionary on grid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m09s)

[to contain the storyboard. And then this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m11s)

[guy here just changes to be uh visual](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m15s)

[state storyboard equals static reference](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m18s)

[insert key that you gave the storyboard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m21s)

[when you put it in the resources up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m23s)

[there. it makes it easier to look it up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m24s)

[rather than having to do all of the back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m27s)

[and forth walking through the visual](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m30s)

[states and otherwise.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m32s)

[Um, and then you can attack it that way.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m34s)

[That I I think that would be the way the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m41s)

[only way I would say makes it a little](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m44s)

[bit easier because no, you can't you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m45s)

[can't bind the thing there. I will say](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m52s)

[because you're setting Hang on. Now that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m54s)

[I've got this open, let me back up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m55s)

[There's there's another kind of cheap](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h27m58s)

[trick that is often done as well, but I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m00s)

[want to look at this. Make sure I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m03s)

[steer you a straight. Um because you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m05s)

[setting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m08s)

[speed as an int and you are taking the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m10s)

[int down into milliseconds.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m14s)

[So, is that actually opposite of what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m20s)

[you want? Because if you're p the the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m22s)

[bigger the speed, the slower it goes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m24s)

[because the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m28s)

[feels like that might be not quite what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m30s)

[you're what you're after. Um because if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m32s)

[the if the the bigger number you pass](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m36s)

[in, the bigger duration it's going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m38s)

[be, the longer it's going to stretch it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m40s)

[out. Uh run the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m42s)

[Uh, let's go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m47s)

[Code open and Kraken.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m50s)

[Dang it. There. At least now I've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m53s)

[the check marks checked. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h28m56s)

[uh, clone from repo. Clone.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m00s)

[Okay. We'll launch this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m07s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m14s)

[Grab the solution](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m22s)

[and launch this guy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m33s)

[Oh, I see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m55s)

[On, off, dim.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h29m58s)

[If I do this and I go on,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m04s)

[off.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m10s)

[I got it. It's because you're setting it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m12s)

[like that. So it so it is intentional](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m15s)

[that the bigger the speed it because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m16s)

[it's labeled here as transition speed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m18s)

[Got it. Okay. No, I was going to say the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m20s)

[only thing that I might do instead here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m23s)

[is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m27s)

[Right. So if we take this and go with um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m30s)

[something like this grid resources](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m38s)

[uh X key](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m40s)

[on storyboard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m43s)

[this comes down here. This comes down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m46s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m48s)

[that nature](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m56s)

[and I'm fairly confident this works but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h30m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m02s)

[pardon all of the things and then this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m04s)

[comes down here of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m06s)

[get that um and then from here it would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m10s)

[be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m16s)

[find resource](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m19s)

[and you might want to use on or try find](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m21s)

[resource on storyboard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m24s)

[as story](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m28s)

[uh storyboard.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m31s)

[Um and actually we'll just do an is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m34s)

[right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m37s)

[SB. Boom boom boom. And then I can come](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m38s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m42s)

[and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m44s)

[do this,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m46s)

[right? So SB duration](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m48s)

[and this should still then work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m52s)

[So if I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h31m58s)

[dim](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m01s)

[on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m03s)

[So it saves you a little bit on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m06s)

[trouble of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m08s)

[actually we'll just do this. So, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m10s)

[saves you a little bit of trouble on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m13s)

[looking it up if you shove it into a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m15s)

[resource and then and then pull it out.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m16s)

[Again, there's the try find on here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m20s)

[which is probably better. All right. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m21s)

[off on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m24s)

[Oh, does that not actually is it not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m30s)

[hitting?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m31s)

[Hold on. On.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m34s)

[So, let's see. Root find resource.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m40s)

[Found the storyboard](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m44s)

[dim](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h32m56s)

[on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m04s)

[You just set this to instant.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m06s)

[If I dial this guy all the way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m09s)

[down to here, right? Off.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m12s)

[On,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m16s)

[dim.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m23s)

[It not adjusting the storyboard. Does](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m25s)

[the visual state grab it and freeze it?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m28s)

[Is that what's going on?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m31s)

[It's working only for on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m35s)

[Right. I realize I only moved one of the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m44s)

[storyboards up. I'm just surprised that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m46s)

[because when you don't specify a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m54s)

[duration, it it figures out what it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m55s)

[thinks is a reasonable one. But I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h33m58s)

[surprised that when I change](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m00s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m05s)

[that it's not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m09s)

[actually it's seeming to do anything.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m11s)

[I would have expected](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m17s)

[and it's possible the visual state is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m22s)

[gra. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m23s)

[But yeah, no to to the short version is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m26s)

[no. There is no way to bind and you end](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m29s)

[up doing something not too unlike what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m32s)

[you've done here. The thing that often](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m35s)

[gets changed around is there's rather](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m38s)

[than setting exact values in a lot of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m42s)

[cases, a lot of times people will abuse](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m48s)

[when this thing is um animating for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h34m59s)

[example because this is targeting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m02s)

[opacity. Yeah. When this thing is going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m03s)

[through and doing it because opacity is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m07s)

[just zero to one the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m08s)

[like I've seen people do like attach](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m12s)

[properties or similar that way it can go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m14s)

[through and set it. In your case I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m16s)

[know that that makes it any better.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m18s)

[You kind of already have that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m22s)

[Yeah, it may you may be about as close](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m26s)

[as you're going to get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m29s)

[at least for custom controls. That is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m32s)

[when building out custom controls. Do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m35s)

[keep in mind you often end up having to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m37s)

[do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m39s)

[what feels like too much work in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m41s)

[code behind for a custom control because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m43s)

[you kind of have to do everything](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m46s)

[yourself. You can't rely on MVVM inside](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m48s)

[of the custom control. You you have to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m51s)

[basically build out the relevant logic](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m54s)

[and that's kind of by design.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h35m58s)

[Okay. So, I got this. I got this. I got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m03s)

[this. And we're going to use block body.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m07s)

[And we're going to go lock running apps.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m10s)

[And then we're going to do that. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m16s)

[we're going to go for each](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m18s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m22s)

[var app in running app values.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m24s)

[Wait app dispose a sync.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m30s)

[Um this feels like something I could do.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m33s)

[Uh let's see. Await. Let's do await.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m40s)

[Stop helping me. Await](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m45s)

[task when all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m48s)

[uh let's see running apps do values](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h36m52s)

[that's what I want to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m01s)

[what are you unhappy about cannot wait](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m04s)

[in the await in the body of a lock](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m06s)

[statement ah that's what I have to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m08s)

[okay got it got it got it got it uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m10s)

[let's see uh list I apps](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m13s)

[to dispose. No, you were fine. C-pilot,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m19s)

[you are apps.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m22s)

[So, stop helping me copilot. I would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m25s)

[like apps to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m28s)

[co-pilot. Stop helping. You're being](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m32s)

[annoying. So, we'll lock. Do that and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m36s)

[then we'll close.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m39s)

[Um, and this becomes just apps.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m44s)

[Is it me or the stream lagging? Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m50s)

[hopefully just you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m53s)

[My thing shows clean on Twitch, so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h37m58s)

[hopefully it's just you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m02s)

[But I also](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m05s)

[it it could it could be related.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m08s)

[If anyone else is there and willing to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m11s)

[check or at least respond, that'd be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m13s)

[cool. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m15s)

[Let me grab this guy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m20s)

[We're going to do collection expression.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m23s)

[And I think what I want to do here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m25s)

[wrap this guy up in a uh public a async](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m28s)

[task](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m34s)

[uh start app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m36s)

[And this guy needs to actually return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m39s)

[back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m41s)

[string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m44s)

[uh for an app ID or similar. So I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m48s)

[that's what we're going to do here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m51s)

[for these tools. I believe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m52s)

[I can get away with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h38m56s)

[doing a constructor and having the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m00s)

[constructor take in a thingy. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m02s)

[what I think works.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m05s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m07s)

[we're going to try this first of all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m09s)

[just to see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m10s)

[if this works. Working fine now. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m12s)

[good, good, good, good. Um, let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m16s)

[So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m18s)

[restart the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m20s)

[Clear the output for the moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m24s)

[Waiting for server to respond to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m29s)

[initialize request.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m30s)

[Oh, turns out if you don't actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m38s)

[implement the method,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m41s)

[uh, let's see. Return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m44s)

[empty string. That'll work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m47s)

[Uh, let's see. Go back.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m51s)

[Clear. Restart.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m53s)

[because I think then we can let the MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h39m56s)

[server or the MCP client](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m01s)

[or I guess in this case MCP server run](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m05s)

[the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m11s)

[Uh we'll back up to here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m14s)

[and I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m16s)

[this guy will work. Oh no, he should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m19s)

[throw a DI exception. This will actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m21s)

[be good.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m24s)

[Um, let's see. Server error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m31s)

[I'm surprised it didn't throw a DI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m35s)

[exception.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m37s)

[Okay. Well, let's let's continue down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m40s)

[this path then because I think it should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m41s)

[have because I didn't actually register](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m45s)

[this thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m47s)

[Uh, let's see. Builder services add](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m49s)

[singleton. Yeah, that thing. Stop](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m53s)

[formatting it funky on me, you jerk.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h40m56s)

[Okay. And then this guy, what I want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m00s)

[do is have him](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m10s)

[maybe I don't want it to be start app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m17s)

[Maybe I want it to be register app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m19s)

[app. So in this case we are once again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m26s)

[going to do bar app. So let's do let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m29s)

[actually lock the dictionary](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m34s)

[um running apps](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m37s)

[and we'll do string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m42s)

[app ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m45s)

[and then app ID is going to get](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m47s)

[uh we'll call it app but we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m51s)

[do something simple because these just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m53s)

[need to be unique and so we are going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m55s)

[do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h41m58s)

[uh running apps Guess](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m00s)

[if we if we well once we dispose](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m04s)

[we'll just it it'll be fine for now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m11s)

[Count plus one. All right. We'll just do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m13s)

[something simple. Um running apps app ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m15s)

[return app ID.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m20s)

[Right. So we'll do that. We'll do that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m23s)

[And then over here we should uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m26s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m33s)

[oh that we didn't do that's why it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m37s)

[didn't fail out with the DI registration](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m40s)

[because this is the wrong one. I need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m42s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m46s)

[and this needs to be app tools.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m48s)

[And we need this to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m52s)

[string returns the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h42m56s)

[um ID of the started applications.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m00s)

[Um, how about](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m05s)

[ZAML test ID of the application?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m08s)

[So, we want to come down here and we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m16s)

[want to do app service manager.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m19s)

[Get you not to be static anymore.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m23s)

[Uh, app service.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m27s)

[Let's just do this up onto a primary](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m33s)

[constructor so I don't have to think too](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m35s)

[hard. Thanks.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m37s)

[App service manager register app. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m40s)

[then we're going to return that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m42s)

[because that is going to give us back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m45s)

[our string.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m46s)

[Um, this does not need to be a sync](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m49s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m53s)

[We go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m56s)

[That gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h43m59s)

[And then what I want is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m02s)

[over here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m06s)

[update ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m08s)

[string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m11s)

[app ID the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m13s)

[ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m17s)

[test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m18s)

[application IDally using those and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m20s)

[we will do once again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m25s)

[use primary constructor and I want app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m29s)

[service manager.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m32s)

[Uh I need a way to get my app back.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m34s)

[So uh uh public pool try get app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m38s)

[something of that nature.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m44s)

[Try get app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m48s)

[existing app. So if this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m51s)

[right that gets me to there](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h44m56s)

[does my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m00s)

[uh get main window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m04s)

[So var window, we'll just assume that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m08s)

[this works](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m12s)

[and then window](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m16s)

[uh oh wait this wants an await.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m21s)

[Okay, so we just need all of you need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m24s)

[just go away. Stop it. You're you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m26s)

[you're in the way. Uh window dot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m28s)

[what is this unhappy about? Don't you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m34s)

[tell me possible no reference? No. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m35s)

[so the turn](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m40s)

[not know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m43s)

[uh not know when what is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m48s)

[why am I why am I I thought it was not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m56s)

[know when not null.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h45m58s)

[Uh let's see here. Oh is it do I do it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m02s)

[here? I think I do it here. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m06s)

[see. Not null when return value is true.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m09s)

[Okay, that's the kicker. That should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m17s)

[shut that one up. Window set content.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m20s)

[Then we'll snip it. Await.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m25s)

[Um and then I don't think we need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m28s)

[return anything here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m30s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m33s)

[If](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m37s)

[window is not null, we should probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m39s)

[figure out how to return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m42s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m45s)

[due to error cases right there. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m48s)

[gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m52s)

[So, but we should be able to come back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h46m58s)

[here. Grab this and restart the tool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m01s)

[We're going to clear that and wait for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m09s)

[it to initialize.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m11s)

[Then we're going to come up here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m13s)

[discover two tools. Great. Come here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m15s)

[Execute.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m19s)

[It should start the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m21s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m24s)

[Change the content to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m26s)

[ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m30s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m33s)

[uh change the content to a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m35s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m40s)

[with the text.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m42s)

[We're not even going to tell it what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m46s)

[it's supposed to do. I want it to infer](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m47s)

[the ZAML for me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m49s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h47m54s)

[oh, it is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m00s)

[it tried to call the thing, but it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m04s)

[there was an error uh with a new the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m08s)

[process ID may not have been correct.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m10s)

[Yeah. So, something went](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m12s)

[I didn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m15s)

[uh let's see. So, it still thought that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m18s)

[was a process ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m21s)

[and the tools.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m24s)

[Why was it convinced of those things?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m30s)

[Do I need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m36s)

[I'm going to go here again. I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m39s)

[wondering if I do I need to update the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m41s)

[tools.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m44s)

[This returns the ZAML test host.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m48s)

[Okay, let's let's grab this. Let's just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m51s)

[do a new chat session. I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m56s)

[something is being held on to that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h48m59s)

[shouldn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m01s)

[because it still had the old signature.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m07s)

[So, something was holding on to it. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m09s)

[wonder if me reverting back to that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m11s)

[state it held on to it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m12s)

[So, it did](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m17s)

[a running app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m26s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m29s)

[I should probably dump the logging](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m35s)

[because I'm actually not confident the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m37s)

[login is going to help because the login](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m39s)

[is designed for a unit test consumption,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m40s)

[not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m43s)

[AI test consumption.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m45s)

[Maybe I should actually kill that off.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m49s)

[Um, let's get rid of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m53s)

[because that will that will keep it from](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m56s)

[writing to the console.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h49m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m01s)

[I wonder does it make sense to debug](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m03s)

[write it? No, I don't think it I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m06s)

[think it does. We do write out files](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m08s)

[and that's probably better. So let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m13s)

[close that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m16s)

[Stop. Stop your execution.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m18s)

[Um restart the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m22s)

[Clear that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m25s)

[because it should rebuild.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m28s)

[If it doesn't, I may just stop it and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m34s)

[manually recompile.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m36s)

[That's the other thing we can do. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m38s)

[okay. So let's let's do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m40s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m45s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m48s)

[update](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m50s)

[update the ZAML to a text](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m51s)

[box](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m56s)

[uh with the text.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h50m57s)

[So, it still wants process ID. Why do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m04s)

[you think you need process ID?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m07s)

[Why are you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m11s)

[There was an error. This could be due to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m16s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m18s)

[show me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m21s)

[Yeah. Why do you think like you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m23s)

[trying to send process ID into the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m25s)

[update? Am I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m26s)

[I am going to stop the server and I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m38s)

[going to manually recompile this. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m42s)

[don't think it's getting updated code.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m44s)

[I think it is lost its mind and it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m48s)

[doesn't know which end is up](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m51s)

[because that should be the right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m55s)

[signature.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h51m58s)

[I would love to see this thing start up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m00s)

[Uh uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m07s)

[interface](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m09s)

[there happy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m11s)

[Yeah, I don't care.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m17s)

[Okay, so that build output is correct](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m19s)

[now. And then we're going to come in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m22s)

[here and we are going to start this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m24s)

[And I want to once again copy all this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m30s)

[And I'm going to do a new chat session.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m33s)

[And we're going to do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m37s)

[There we go. So, we've got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m41s)

[press control C to shut down because you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m44s)

[see it is just running a generic host.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m46s)

[It's nothing fancy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m48s)

[Then we're going to plug this in.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m51s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m55s)

[So, it did this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m57s)

[demo snippet output app one. Great. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h52m59s)

[looks like what I expect.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m02s)

[Update the content to be a text box with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m05s)

[the text of foo.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m10s)

[And then why do you keep wanting to send](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m15s)

[in process ID?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m18s)

[Who is holding on to this information?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m21s)

[Who?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m25s)

[Well, I'm going to always allow this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m30s)

[There was an error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m33s)

[Would you like me to relaunch the window](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m36s)

[with a new?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m37s)

[No. Pass in the app. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m39s)

[uh What are the parameters to the update](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m44s)

[app ZAML tool?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m51s)

[That is incorrect.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h53m59s)

[That is absolutely incorrect. Why are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m02s)

[you convinced of that?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m05s)

[Let's restart VS Code I think because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m10s)

[am convinced it is caching something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m13s)

[somewhere and I'm not sure where.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m16s)

[Do not like this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m20s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m23s)

[we will come here. We will launch from](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m29s)

[this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m31s)

[cuz it's returning the right value.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m45s)

[I'm just surprised the other one is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h54m50s)

[Not showing me what I expect.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m00s)

[Come on. Launch.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m03s)

[Good. It's probably recompiling the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m06s)

[universe if it's taking this long.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m07s)

[Don't everybody run it once. Come on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m16s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m19s)

[And that looks like what I would expect.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m22s)

[Good.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m24s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m26s)

[Update to a text box with the text of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m28s)

[if you say process ID again.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m38s)

[There you go. Okay. So, it was holding](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m41s)

[on to something.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m43s)

[So it did the zaml snippet](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m48s)

[textbox text foo but my implementation](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m52s)

[must be wrong](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m55s)

[because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m58s)

[yeah it it did the thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h55m59s)

[set content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m04s)

[go to implementation what what did I do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m08s)

[wrong here this is my own library I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m11s)

[shouldn't be this dumb um because on the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m13s)

[app tools](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m16s)

[Uh, let's see. Create window with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m19s)

[content.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m22s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m25s)

[I mean, it's spinning the window,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m29s)

[setting the stuff up.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m31s)

[Let me just look at Snoop real quick.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m34s)

[Like, I I kind of know what I'm going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m36s)

[see based on the output. I'm just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m37s)

[surprised that that's what I got.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m41s)

[Text block.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m45s)

[Yeah. So, it got set to a string, which](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m48s)

[is why it got rendered that way, which I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m50s)

[guess is the expected behavior](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m54s)

[because if you do content like that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h56m58s)

[versus](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m02s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m08s)

[But what I have tests that do this, I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m10s)

[confused.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m14s)

[because uh yeah, sure fine. Um oh, set](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m17s)

[ZAML content. That's what I didn't do.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m22s)

[So, it turns out if you don't use your](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m26s)

[library properly, it doesn't work](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m28s)

[because set ZAML content is actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m32s)

[then going to parse it as ZAML and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m34s)

[render it accordingly.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m36s)

[Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m38s)

[So now if I stop you,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m43s)

[you should finish compiling now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m49s)

[There you go. And now we restart you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m53s)

[Start.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m57s)

[And now we should be able to run this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h57m59s)

[test again.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m04s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m08s)

[Uh, update to a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m12s)

[to a text box with the string.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m16s)

[Come on. Show me a text box. Oh, look at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m22s)

[that, baby. Look at that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m25s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m29s)

[It is working. It is working. Oh, I love](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m32s)

[this so much. I love this so much. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m36s)

[now we're cooking with fire. Now we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m39s)

[cooking with fire. So, we've given it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m41s)

[the ability to start. Um, let's go back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m42s)

[to our app tools.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m45s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m48s)

[and we want to give it the ability to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m52s)

[shut down an app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m54s)

[Uh, let's see. Shut down app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h58m57s)

[So, string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m03s)

[app ID. Um, I kind of want a nice way of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m06s)

[replicating this over and over.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m10s)

[I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m17s)

[feel like I'm going to need this a lot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m19s)

[Um, so I think I'm going to at least](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m23s)

[capture this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m25s)

[in a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m28s)

[constant. I think is the path of least](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m30s)

[resistance. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m32s)

[go here. And so we do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m37s)

[public static.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m41s)

[This is too hard.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m43s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m46s)

[I know, but it's awesome. Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m47s)

[uh shared strings](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m53s)

[uh public con string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=02h59m56s)

[That's what I want there. That way I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h00m05s)

[Because when I put this parameter on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h00m28s)

[something, I want them all to match](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h00m31s)

[here though. I app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m03s)

[see drop the word var out of this and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m10s)

[then we do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m13s)

[if app is not null](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m16s)

[and then we come up here and go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m18s)

[drop the word async off the end of that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h02m50s)

[to have to expose that further down. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h03m34s)

[let's go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h03m37s)

[Let's do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h03m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h03m43s)

[uh let's see save](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h03m46s)

[we need to do try get app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m06s)

[Let's see. Out var](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m10s)

[like an if there. Grab that. Grab that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m15s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m36s)

[Uh I image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m38s)

[screenshot gets a weight. I don't know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m41s)

[the best way to return this. I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m44s)

[writing it to disk is probably](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m46s)

[the path of least resistance.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m49s)

[Um let's see. async that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m53s)

[uh because screenshot has a save method](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h04m57s)

[on it. So, let's give it a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m01s)

[String uh image file path.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m17s)

[the file path where to write the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m20s)

[I think it's expected to be a bit map,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m29s)

[but I I don't recall exactly. So, I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m31s)

[not going to worry about that. Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m35s)

[see. File path or stream.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m38s)

[I think we're just going to do image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m41s)

[file path. And I need to check and see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m42s)

[if this will handle creating the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m45s)

[directory.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m47s)

[It will not. Okay. So, we need to handle](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m48s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m52s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h05m56s)

[uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m00s)

[Uh path get directory name](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m02s)

[uh image file path.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m08s)

[Uh let's see we go here if get directory](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m11s)

[name is with a length greater than zero](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m15s)

[create directory great. So that should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m20s)

[ensure appropriate directory path](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m23s)

[otherwise it probably errors.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m26s)

[Great. Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m32s)

[build that sucker. Stop the running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m35s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m47s)

[and I guess that's I actually in my air](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m50s)

[cases I can just write back messages.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m54s)

[Oh, that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h06m57s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m00s)

[oh, oh. Oh, I'm realizing something.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m02s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m06s)

[else](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m09s)

[console right line](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m12s)

[I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m42s)

[I suspect it because I'd like to be able](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m43s)

[to just run point out to tell Copilot,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m46s)

[hey, the app isn't running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m49s)

[and have it automatically work. Oh, this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m52s)

[might be pretty epic because then I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m55s)

[think it will automatically attempt to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h07m57s)

[fix it. Because co-pilot is designed](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m01s)

[like it wants to succeed in whatever](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m04s)

[task it's given. It really really wants](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m06s)

[to succeed. And so if it knows the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m08s)

[objective,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m12s)

[we'll start this up again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m16s)

[and then we'll see what it does because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m19s)

[this is this would be this is where it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m21s)

[going to start to get really cool when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m23s)

[we can start inspecting these things.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m25s)

[send.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m31s)

[So, it's going to run and it's going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m33s)

[attempt to invoke the tool with an app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m35s)

[ID that no longer exists because we only](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m37s)

[keep that in memory. It should get the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m39s)

[that didn't work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m56s)

[Let me back up. Let me Let's try Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h08m59s)

[just do a console right line.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m01s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m07s)

[okay. So, let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m12s)

[do that. We'll build this and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m15s)

[hopefully](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m18s)

[this just works.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m21s)

[Come on. Come on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h09m27s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m16s)

[I wonder if so I guess the question is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m28s)

[what is the right way to do this right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m31s)

[see how it responds](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m49s)

[because that it logged appropriately and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m53s)

[sent it out](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h22m55s)

[want.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h23m00s)

[And then I think we can actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h23m02s)

[probably dial this back down to GPT dumb](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h23m04s)

[Let's see. Any errors that originate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h24m48s)

[running.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m06s)

[Great. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m08s)

[oh, this guy wants a constructor](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m12s)

[parameter, not a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m14s)

[not a property initializer. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m18s)

[Um, let's see. To content block,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m21s)

[uh, are you not a content block? Is that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m27s)

[not a thing?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m30s)

[It might be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m34s)

[AI content.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m37s)

[Yeah, that's what I thought. And none of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m41s)

[the these are very different types. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m44s)

[it is landed on something different. But](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m46s)

[I do think this call to a result](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m49s)

[seems better.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m52s)

[Uh let's see here. So, what is what is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m55s)

[this content block thing?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h27m58s)

[Um, get sets the response content for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m00s)

[the tool call](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m03s)

[and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m07s)

[content block](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m12s)

[is a huge number of things, but the nice](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m15s)

[part is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m19s)

[text content block, image content block,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m22s)

[audio. Oh, I could return back an image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m26s)

[content block for my Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m28s)

[oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m31s)

[that's con. Okay, that might solve the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m33s)

[get screenshot problem, too. Okay, so we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m35s)

[want this guy here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m38s)

[Uh, and so text content block.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m41s)

[Okay, so let's undo what I had and just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m45s)

[change you to text content block. Text](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m49s)

[content block. text content block.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m52s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m56s)

[and it's set is error is true. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h28m58s)

[let's see if this gives us better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m01s)

[results because if it does,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m02s)

[we are going to go through and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m06s)

[swap out the other stuff to start using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m09s)

[it. Secretly, I'm also using this as a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m11s)

[test case for figuring out what um an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m14s)

[MCP project needs to look like because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m17s)

[do want to put one of these in my .NET](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m19s)

[templates repository.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m21s)

[Okay, start this again.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m24s)

[Clear that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m27s)

[And then waiting for server to respond.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m31s)

[What I'd like it to realize is that it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m37s)

[in an error state and a to prompt to fix](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m39s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m41s)

[Previous window is no longer running.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m44s)

[Oh, that's exactly what I wanted.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m46s)

[Look at that. So, because it knew it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m53s)

[wasn't running, it then reran this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h29m56s)

[and started the app with the right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m00s)

[content. Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m01s)

[that is exactly what we wanted. Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m05s)

[booyah. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m07s)

[Uh, let's see. Great. Shut down the app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m11s)

[And it should terminate it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m15s)

[Uh, always allow. Boom. Oh, yeah. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m18s)

[that Thank you, co-pilot. You've been a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m24s)

[wonderful help. Um, so we need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m27s)

[staying ahead of the curve.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m33s)

[Uh, so what I would like here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m35s)

[I I have a sinking suspicion I'm going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m39s)

[to need something. So, internal class,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m41s)

[uh, base tools. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m45s)

[want some shared functionality between](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m50s)

[these um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m51s)

[protected static](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m54s)

[uh let's see call tool result](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h30m58s)

[uh let's see error ring message I just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m04s)

[want a simple way of doing that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m09s)

[and so I want to do this I want to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m13s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m17s)

[Stop helping me. Stop helping me,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m18s)

[co-pilot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m20s)

[Um, let's see. And I guess we you just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m22s)

[want to do the the simple one. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m24s)

[fine. Okay. So, we are going to do this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m26s)

[and then move you to base tools. And now](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m30s)

[what we can do is I just want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m32s)

[return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m37s)

[error. That way it looks very familiar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m39s)

[and friendly. And that's all I really](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m43s)

[want, right? Make keep it simple. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m46s)

[way I can easily replicate this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m48s)

[elsewhere.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m50s)

[Error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m52s)

[Air. And that's kind of all it's going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m55s)

[to take. Oh, co-pilot. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h31m57s)

[and then I think maybe we give ourselves](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m04s)

[a success one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m06s)

[Uh, protected.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m09s)

[Yeah, I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m14s)

[um we do this, but I think we're going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m20s)

[to make this a little bigger. Use block](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m22s)

[body. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m25s)

[content wants a eye.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m32s)

[Uh, I list](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m35s)

[content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m38s)

[and block.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m40s)

[Yeah, kind of like that. Thank you,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m44s)

[Copilot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m45s)

[More like that. That way I can now do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m49s)

[the same thing down here and just return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m51s)

[success.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m55s)

[And now look at that. We have a nice](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m57s)

[easy easy way of building out these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h32m59s)

[tools. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m01s)

[Oh, baby. We are cooking with fire.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m04s)

[Uh, okay. So, we're going to put you on](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m07s)

[to the end of that. And then we want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m10s)

[turn success. And we want all of our](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m14s)

[tools to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m17s)

[um we need to figure out how to return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m21s)

[something structured.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m24s)

[Um, but this is going to be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m28s)

[uh what's the the magical name here?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m33s)

[Call tool result.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m36s)

[This is call tool result. And then this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m39s)

[should probably be a bool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m43s)

[And then this will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m47s)

[uh let's see return true.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m51s)

[Hey, society dog. Um, hope everything's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h33m56s)

[really appreciate that. I I do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m05s)

[appreciate that. Right now, we are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m09s)

[building we're attempting to build a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m11s)

[little MCP server using ZAML test to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m12s)

[hopefully make building out the UI tests](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m15s)

[in the material design library stupid](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m18s)

[easy. ideally to the point where I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m21s)

[just assign co-pilot to the job and walk](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m24s)

[away. Now, it'll obviously need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m27s)

[prompting to understand what it needs to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m29s)

[do. But](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m31s)

[so far, we have an MCP server that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m35s)

[actually leveraging ZAML test to do the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m37s)

[NEP,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m39s)

[which is great. Uh let's see here. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m41s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m44s)

[uh let's see in the case we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m46s)

[do success else](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m49s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m51s)

[error. I wonder if error is the right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m53s)

[word. Maybe it should be failure.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m55s)

[Maybe it should be failure.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h34m58s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m02s)

[really you renamed it and then didn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m05s)

[bother to update the one usage. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m06s)

[to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m15s)

[known app ID,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m18s)

[known app ID or app is not running.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m26s)

[Uh how about better? We can probably do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m33s)

[this better. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m35s)

[no known](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m38s)

[app with ID](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m41s)

[is running. We'll do something like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m45s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m48s)

[Like that. Something like that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m54s)

[Something like that. Uh, let's see. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m55s)

[then you need to do an await.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h35m58s)

[Then we'll do this. so that it evaluates](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m03s)

[in the right order. Let's see. Can only](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m06s)

[be used within an async method. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m09s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I get it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m11s)

[I got I got you. I got you. I got you. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m13s)

[understand. We're We're on the same](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m15s)

[page. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m16s)

[That gets me there. And then this one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m19s)

[gets me really excited. So, call tool](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m21s)

[result. And I want this one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m26s)

[to return the image back. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m31s)

[Wow. Sounds nice. 10,000% over my level.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m32s)

[I did a small uh The Sims 3 fixer tool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m36s)

[So, set the game up with all the great](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m39s)

[game uh pre-form tools people made and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m41s)

[set all the settings people in one go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m44s)

[because I know it can be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m45s)

[uh a scare for regular PC users. Made it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m48s)

[for my partner and then just made it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m51s)

[public and free for all. That's awesome.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m52s)

[That is awesome. And you might be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m54s)

[surprised, some of this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h36m56s)

[like I'm kind of learning like this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m00s)

[going to be one of my first kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m02s)

[full-fledged M MCPS. Like I've done some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m05s)

[small sample things that didn't feel](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m08s)

[realish. This one I'm going to try to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m10s)

[make realish. So, it's going to be going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m12s)

[to be good. Um, so this thing here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m16s)

[seemed to indicate that there was a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m21s)

[image type down here, image content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m25s)

[block. So what does an image content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m27s)

[block take](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m31s)

[because I would love it if my image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m33s)

[content block](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m35s)

[what what are you unhappy about? Data](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m37s)

[and mime type. Okay, so what does data](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m40s)

[want?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m44s)

[Your data wants a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m46s)

[what?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m49s)

[String base 64 encoded image data and a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m50s)

[mime type.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h37m55s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m00s)

[okay. I think that's fine. We'll need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m02s)

[let's see image and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m26s)

[I think my data is bit mapap. But maybe](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m31s)

[I should actually check and see what I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m34s)

[collecting because I don't actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m37s)

[The other one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m44s)

[doing? Client get screenshot. Oh, right.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h38m51s)

[Um, I am mildly concerned that I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m38s)

[there's a lot of like CEOs laying people](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m40s)

[Kool-Aid of AI is going to be magical](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m45s)

[and work. So, I I think that that fear](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m48s)

[is real, but I don't think that that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m50s)

[matches reality. And at some point, I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m53s)

[think that's going to circle back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m55s)

[around. Like, it absolutely makes me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h39m58s)

[more efficient, but I don't know that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m00s)

[would say that it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m02s)

[somehow](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m06s)

[going to replace me. Like most of the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m08s)

[time, like the the places I'm dealing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m10s)

[with, if AI makes your developers 20 or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m12s)

[30% faster, then like they aren't short](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m16s)

[on work, that just means that they've](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m20s)

[gotten stuff done a little bit quicker](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m22s)

[and they move on to the next, you know,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m23s)

[70 or 80% in the backlog to work on. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m26s)

[let's see. So, I need a way of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m30s)

[returning](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m35s)

[doing it that way.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h40m43s)

[do like if it can get to the point where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h41m08s)

[it generates flawless code, it still](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h41m10s)

[mode and mix stuff up and then just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m30s)

[alter stuff so much because it suddenly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m32s)

[something and some complete other thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m36s)

[that quite a bit. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m42s)

[what was the error I gave? No, no app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m45s)

[kind of want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m52s)

[templatize that so that I can do that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m54s)

[better, but we'll deal with that um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h42m58s)

[later. So, that will handle the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m00s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m05s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m12s)

[let's take this uh let's see return](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m17s)

[results content block. What else did it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m24s)

[have down here? Because I could](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m27s)

[structure output this guy. Like that's a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m29s)

[thing I could do.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m33s)

[Let's see. Text, image, audio.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m37s)

[I'm just wondering if it makes more](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m43s)

[sense to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m45s)

[return a strongly typed object as well.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m49s)

[If that would be better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m53s)

[because it's not going to be any of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m56s)

[those things.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h43m58s)

[So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m00s)

[I could](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m04s)

[maybe I just leave it as is for now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m08s)

[Maybe I leave it as is because there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m15s)

[no way it's going to do anything other](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m17s)

[than what it already does.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m19s)

[Um, we'll do that for the moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m22s)

[being blocked because the server is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m29s)

[Let you finish compiling. We're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m34s)

[start the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m36s)

[Uh, let's see. Let's go up here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m39s)

[Uh, we're going to do this and it should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m44s)

[figure itself out again](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h44m47s)

[get main window. We'll uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m16s)

[uh todo handle multiple windows](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m22s)

[right um if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m27s)

[app.get Get main window is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m30s)

[window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m33s)

[All right, we can force the window](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m35s)

[foreground](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m37s)

[uh window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m39s)

[Oh, this needs to be in a wait](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m42s)

[uh window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m46s)

[What is the There is a call that I have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m50s)

[for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m53s)

[um sending keyboard input because it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h47m58s)

[requires](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m00s)

[it requires the window to be in focus](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m02s)

[before you start sending keys to it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m06s)

[Um activate window. That's what I called](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m10s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m13s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m15s)

[so that goes there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m18s)

[Might need to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m21s)

[call that in other places. So move](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m25s)

[keyboard focus calls it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m27s)

[and send input calls it, but no one else](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m31s)

[does.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m36s)

[I might need to expose it to me because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m40s)

[I don't appear to have given myself a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m42s)

[way of doing it. Um, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m45s)

[we need to Yeah, because doing it when](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m51s)

[creating the window is fine, but uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m53s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m56s)

[Do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h48m58s)

[close activate window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m00s)

[We need to we need to add that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m04s)

[Um, let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m07s)

[then handle multiple windows and do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m10s)

[that. So that works. The error though we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m12s)

[were fighting with is it claimed that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m17s)

[type was unspecified](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m19s)

[is there is a type here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m22s)

[So what is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m29s)

[I mean type should be image because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m34s)

[we're calling the constructor.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m36s)

[There shouldn't be any](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m39s)

[I'm confused as to why it's confused](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m43s)

[because I can't set it to anything else.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m46s)

[I wonder if it's unhappy that I did bit](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m48s)

[map and it wants JPEG.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m50s)

[I wonder if that's part of the issue](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m54s)

[because it did use image/jpeg](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h49m57s)

[as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m00s)

[one of the samples](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m02s)

[however we need to.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m07s)

[Let's close this down.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m09s)

[Um, I might also want to give myself](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m13s)

[because I could hunt those out.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m23s)

[Yep.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m30s)

[And then build](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m32s)

[because I could I could leave myself](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h50m34s)

[that? Do I have any influence of this?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h51m41s)

[There's annotations](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h51m45s)

[and metadata.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h51m48s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h51m51s)

[uh let's do this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h51m57s)

[Uh co-pilot actions add to chat.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m01s)

[Come here. How can I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m06s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m35s)

[yeah. No, that's that's actually not](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m40s)

[let's let's try this one more time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m48s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m52s)

[restore.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m55s)

[Yeah. Go back to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h52m56s)

[Copilot actions, add to chat, and then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m12s)

[we go here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m15s)

[How can I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m17s)

[uh set the file name of the image I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m20s)

[return?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m24s)

[that would be wonderful to be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m26s)

[control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m29s)

[uh set its name prior uh the proper way](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m30s)

[use the image content class which has](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m34s)

[additional metadata. Yeah, I don't doubt](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m36s)

[there's additional metadata. That's what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m37s)

[I was trying to figure out.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m39s)

[What are you doing?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m44s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h53m58s)

[yeah, go ahead and search the image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m00s)

[content class which has additional](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m03s)

[metadata properties.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m05s)

[Oh, so you're actually just ripping](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m14s)

[through all of these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m16s)

[Interesting. Just wait until Copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m26s)

[realizes that I've got a decompiler MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m29s)

[co-pilot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m49s)

[Option option two actually save the file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h54m59s)

[like that either.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m04s)

[Doesn't have a file name property. The](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m07s)

[recommended approach is to include a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m09s)

[text content block alongside the image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m10s)

[that provides context about the file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m12s)

[name or other metadata. This allows the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m14s)

[AI client to understand what image](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m16s)

[Sure. Keep](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m25s)

[sure. Let's we can give this a try. I am](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m33s)

[not hopeful. But you know what? We will](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m37s)

[give you a try. Shut up. Shut up. Stop.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m39s)

[Start.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m46s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m48s)

[And then Oh, wait. I I hit start, didn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m51s)

[I? Yeah, I did. Stop. Compile.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h55m54s)

[Now, start. Start probably did it for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m00s)

[me, but we're going to try this. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m03s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m05s)

[I go back here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m07s)

[Start the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m11s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m14s)

[take a screenshot. I guess I could](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m16s)

[probably just arbitrarily tell it take](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m18s)

[screenshots. It doesn't need the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m20s)

[change at all.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m39s)

[Yeah, see that's what I was worried that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m44s)

[it would do is not trust it. So, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m47s)

[still wanted image path and I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m50s)

[wondering if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m52s)

[if that's part of the problem](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h56m58s)

[because it's and this is why it thinks](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m01s)

[it was saving there because it still](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m02s)

[passed it in. There's something that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m04s)

[this holds on to when you don't restart](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m06s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m08s)

[Where would it go?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m11s)

[There's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m15s)

[co-pilot. I want you to do the thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m16s)

[that I told you to do and not the thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m19s)

[that you think you want to do. That is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m21s)

[not okay. That is not okay. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=03h57m22s)

[think I'm going to end up being](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m40s)

[MCP protocol level metadata. So that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m44s)

[probably not it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m47s)

[Like it doesn't have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m50s)

[nothing there. Like is there something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m53s)

[on the base class I'm just missing?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m55s)

[There's type](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h02m58s)

[um annotations. What is an annotation?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m01s)

[An annotation has a list of audiences.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m07s)

[How important the data is for operating](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m16s)

[the server.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m19s)

[Um where zero represents the lowest](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m22s)

[The resource was last modified.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m31s)

[Okay. I mean](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m35s)

[I guess](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m40s)

[it doesn't really give me anything](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m45s)

[helpful to go on though I am noticing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m46s)

[the one thing they have here is links](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m51s)

[into their repo. So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h03m56s)

[schema](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m01s)

[well well](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m03s)

[image content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m05s)

[I would like to know what image content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m09s)

[content](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m14s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m15s)

[the general fields metadata](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m19s)

[specification](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m21s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m23s)

[different providers may support](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m26s)

[different image types. Sure, but I'm](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m28s)

[only interested in co-pilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m30s)

[required data mime type.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m33s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m41s)

[doesn't really tell me anything useful.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m51s)

[That doesn't tell me anything useful.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h04m56s)

[So the only thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m00s)

[is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m06s)

[this for meta level information.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m08s)

[Where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m11s)

[where do you get your metadata](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m13s)

[That doesn't look like what I'm after.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m36s)

[What' you come up with, co-pilot? Uh oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m39s)

[you've done it for me already. Of course](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m42s)

[you have. I'm not sure if I should be](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m44s)

[impressed or terrified.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m46s)

[metadata according to the MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h05m58s)

[specification. I'm sure it is. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m00s)

[why I asked you for it the first time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m02s)

[We just aren't getting along well. I I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m06s)

[think we need to work on our](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m09s)

[do.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m14s)

[Don't feel like this relationship is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m19s)

[tested my dispose. I realized nobody](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m25s)

[else could see that happen. Um but the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m27s)

[when I stopped the server it actually](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m31s)

[Uh, okay. Do the thing again.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m54s)

[Come on, GPT41. I know you're an idiot,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h06m59s)

[We'll](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m18s)

[say this is taking me significantly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m21s)

[longer than I had anticipated. But](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m23s)

[look at that. We do have forgot I added](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m27s)

[co-pilot instructions.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m29s)

[Um for anybody interested, these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m31s)

[instruction files are actually one of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m33s)

[the ways you can um influence](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m36s)

[uh copilot with like repository level](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m40s)

[instructions. There is an agents MD file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m43s)

[that you can do as well which is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m46s)

[little more cross-co compatible with a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m48s)

[lot of other agents but the agents MD](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m50s)

[file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m53s)

[operates at a directory level which is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m54s)

[fine because you can put them at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m57s)

[different directory levels with the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h07m59s)

[closest one taking precedence.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m00s)

[The the thing is is copilot also has](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m04s)

[instruction files and instruction files](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m08s)

[can have uh an apply to set on them](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m10s)

[where you give it like a globbing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m13s)

[pattern. So you can say this applies to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m15s)

[all of my CS files, this applies to all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m16s)

[of my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m20s)

[um start the server. Let me help you. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m22s)

[this applies all of my text files, etc.,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m26s)

[etc., etc., which is which is great. um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m28s)

[and I think is slightly more powerful](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m30s)

[than just doing it at a directory level,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m32s)

[but I don't doubt that there's times](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m34s)

[where having it at a directory level](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m37s)

[over having it on a globbing pattern](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m39s)

[makes more sense. But I think both are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m42s)

[probably useful and copilot's happy to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m44s)

[read in agents MD as well. Um but I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m46s)

[think just about every single](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m50s)

[um agent out there has their own config](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m54s)

[file that they really really like. Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m56s)

[run. Darn it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h08m58s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m04s)

[Did you do the right thing? No.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m06s)

[No, you did not.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m10s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m13s)

[but before I get annoyed,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m18s)

[before I get annoyed, I should reboot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m28s)

[Do the thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m54s)

[I want you to just get an image properly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h09m57s)

[like a good boy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m00s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m50s)

[Uh, I suppose we should probably put the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m52s)

[word MCP in there, too, or someone's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m55s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m57s)

[um get confused.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h10m59s)

[Uh, image ejection in MCP. That is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m03s)

[great. Data mime type image data text.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m09s)

[Perhaps it is PNG and not JPEG.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m48s)

[Uh you could try to reassemble it and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m54s)

[see if it's a valid image. Yeah, I've](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m56s)

[tried that yada yada yada.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h11m58s)

[figure out why am I spraying uh by](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h12m02s)

[that's not the case here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h12m14s)

[that is not the case](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h12m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h12m23s)

[how to best render? Let's Okay,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m05s)

[looking at the generalized content,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m17s)

[Embedded resource route is specifically](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m30s)

[Got it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m44s)

[I mean we should try it but](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m47s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m54s)

[Okay. Impress me, co-pilot. Impress me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h13m57s)

[Uh, aligns better with resource model](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m01s)

[where resources have identifiers, URIs,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m03s)

[and content rather than treating them as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m05s)

[raw embedded media. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m07s)

[That makes sense to me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m10s)

[There you go. Do your thing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m41s)

[Move you to the side.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m45s)

[Just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m49s)

[success.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m52s)

[Look at that. It took a screenshot. It's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m56s)

[so birdie. It's so birdie. So proud of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h14m58s)

[you, co-pilot. I'm so proud of you. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m02s)

[did you did a thing. You know how to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m05s)

[make images now.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m07s)

[Yeah. Yeah. I said finally that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m09s)

[finally is right. I think part of this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m11s)

[was my ignorance on the MCP protocol.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m15s)

[Thank you, Copilot, for reading the docs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m20s)

[and taking three tries to to get it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m22s)

[right. But that got us a good chunk of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m23s)

[the way there. Okay, I'm realizing I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m26s)

[haven't committed anything. So, that's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m30s)

[probably a bad a bad thing. We should we](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m31s)

[should commit what we have because this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m34s)

[is this is in a workingish state](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m36s)

[and we should absolutely](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m40s)

[Let me check what we did over here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m43s)

[That's fine. Whitespace, that's adding](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m46s)

[process ID. That's fine. This is just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m48s)

[exposing process ID.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m51s)

[And actually, I think we can go through](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m54s)

[and revert the process ID changes now,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m56s)

[too, because those are not we're no](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h15m58s)

[longer exposing that process ID back](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m01s)

[out, which makes me which actually makes](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m03s)

[me feel better. I like not having to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m05s)

[have that there. So, let's go kill that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m07s)

[off](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m10s)

[because I don't want any of those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m12s)

[changes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m14s)

[Let's see. And then that comes here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m17s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m20s)

[Process ID.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m23s)

[Uh let's see this guy here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m26s)

[Get rid of you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m30s)

[And then what else you got](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m33s)

[down there? And then the simulator needs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m36s)

[to have it die as well.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m39s)

[And die. Okay. So that that feels nicer.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m43s)

[We aren't using it and we're letting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m48s)

[this guy hold on to it. Okay. So that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m50s)

[gets me to there. That gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m52s)

[The](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m56s)

[the key that I want now is the ability](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h16m59s)

[for it to write the tests](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m01s)

[and for it to evaluate the tests that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m04s)

[it's writing.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m06s)

[That's what I want to do because the end](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m10s)

[goal Oh, and it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m12s)

[Stop the server. I can't compile while](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m15s)

[the server's running because the end](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m17s)

[goal is over here inside of tests](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m19s)

[material design UI tests. We got WPF tab](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m23s)

[control](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m27s)

[tab controls tab control test, right? We](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m30s)

[want this guy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m32s)

[We got this guy. And so what we would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m35s)

[like to do is give this thing enough](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m37s)

[power to be able to launch and run these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m39s)

[to be able to val evaluate them without](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m45s)

[necessarily needing to execute blindly](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m47s)

[because I need it to diagnose the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m52s)

[failures.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m54s)

[So the context I need to give it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h17m58s)

[is enough to be able to understand. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m03s)

[this is where I'm probably going to have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m07s)

[to put some prompts in that explain how](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m08s)

[the material design library is using](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m11s)

[ZAML test.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m13s)

[But I think what I could do down here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m17s)

[this is theme brush set. That isn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m22s)

[useful. Um, context menu.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m23s)

[Where is the scrolling tabs? Uniform](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m29s)

[grid,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m32s)

[virtualization stack panel,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m33s)

[I thought.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m38s)

[Oh, these are the ones that Nikolai](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m40s)

[added, right? So, there is there's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m42s)

[nothing basically here. And ideally what](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m44s)

[we would like to see happen is some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m48s)

[prompt where I can tell it to look at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m54s)

[um setup here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m57s)

[and open in a new tab. But in order for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h18m59s)

[that to work, I need it to also have an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m04s)

[idea to understand what this load zaml](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m07s)

[function is doing. because this guy here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m10s)

[is initializing with material design](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m14s)

[which is fine. I just need to make sure](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m18s)

[that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m21s)

[that I give the prompt enough context to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m25s)

[be able to do this initialization](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m31s)

[so that it can load up the appropriate](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m34s)

[DLS.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m37s)

[I think that's what I need it to do.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m40s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m43s)

[okay. So, step one is I need the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m45s)

[initialize call.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m48s)

[I need the initialized call to support](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m52s)

[loading arbitrary DLS as well as](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m54s)

[application level ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h19m58s)

[That's the next thing that I need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m02s)

[in order to make this viable because I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m05s)

[needed to be able to start the app with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m08s)

[more than just a ZAML snippet because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m10s)

[this is um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m13s)

[doing initialize with material design,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m16s)

[not initialize with defaults,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m19s)

[which is what all this guy does, right?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m22s)

[So the initialize with material designs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m25s)

[is just calling app initialize](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m27s)

[Um, so maybe I should actually do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m31s)

[a separate tool.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m35s)

[Do I expand on this tool? I don't know](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m38s)

[which is better.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m40s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m43s)

[I think what I want to do because down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m47s)

[here I want to do app initialize.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m50s)

[So I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m57s)

[think I just want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h20m59s)

[expand on this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m07s)

[string optional](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m10s)

[uh app dot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m13s)

[or app zaml. We'll make that nullable.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m16s)

[We'll need to give it a better](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m18s)

[description. and then string](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m19s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m24s)

[additional](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m28s)

[assembly paths.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m31s)

[Maybe I should just do additional](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m34s)

[assemblies and then document it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m35s)

[in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m41s)

[then document it there because then if I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m46s)

[have this I can so](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m49s)

[I think what we do is if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m52s)

[uh if not string is null or whites space](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h21m56s)

[app.zaml SAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m00s)

[because this is why you don't like for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m03s)

[your MCP stuff, you don't want to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m05s)

[just blindly expose every function as an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m10s)

[MCP tool. You want to actually think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m12s)

[through what what capabilities do you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m14s)

[want to give the AI](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m17s)

[and implement those instead.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m20s)

[Uh additional assemblies,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m23s)

[we're going to do this instead.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m31s)

[bar](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m32s)

[assemblies because I actually want to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m35s)

[something like dot dot where x x](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m39s)

[uh is not null](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m45s)

[to array.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m50s)

[What is your problem here? Oh, because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m52s)

[it's still nullable.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m54s)

[You can do that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h22m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m00s)

[this is non-null at this point.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m05s)

[How do I get this?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m09s)

[I get this down to a non-nullable thingy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m14s)

[so I can declare it properly.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m17s)

[That's going to be a spread.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m34s)

[Screw it. We'll just do it above.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m38s)

[Uh var uh let's see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m42s)

[bring](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m46s)

[assemblies gets](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m49s)

[empty.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m52s)

[Uh if](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m55s)

[additional assemblies is not null. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h23m57s)

[that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m01s)

[that'll get us to there. So, this um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m05s)

[builds that up. Let's see. Description.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m08s)

[And then we got to think of the proper](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m13s)

[way to actually tell it what we want. Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m15s)

[this is the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m19s)

[I don't think I have to tell it it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m41s)

[optional. I think it knows that by](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m43s)

[virtue of the declaration.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h24m44s)

[load into the application domain.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h25m07s)

[Okay. So, that'll get me to there. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h25m13s)

[then back here,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h25m17s)

[I want to take this new chat](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h25m20s)

[Once it spins that out, hopefully it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h26m50s)

[looks at this and realizes what it needs](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h26m54s)

[to invoke. I'm not confident it's going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h26m56s)

[to.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h26m58s)

[I'm I suspect because you'll note here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m01s)

[when it was thinking it actually figured](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m05s)

[out all of the MCP tools. And this is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m07s)

[something that is interesting to me of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m09s)

[where it's caching this information](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m11s)

[because it didn't start this server. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m13s)

[it didn't get it by looking at the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m15s)

[running server. So, it's holding on to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m17s)

[that information somewhere.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m18s)

[Um, yeah. So, let's see what you did.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m21s)

[Copilot agents. See, that's wrong. You](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m24s)

[didn't name it properly.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m27s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m29s)

[yeah. And you can tell it's wrong](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m35s)

[because it's not down here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m37s)

[Hey, Nabbit, co-pilot. I mean, you're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m40s)

[close, but you're so far away. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m42s)

[see. I believe it's agents.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m46s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m49s)

[uh. Zaml test. Boom.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m54s)

[Zaml test agent.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h27m59s)

[Great. Standard initialization](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m05s)

[structure.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m07s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m10s)

[this is doing it incorrectly.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m16s)

[H, I even gave you the input file that I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m21s)

[wanted. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m24s)

[it's been a long time. Thank you for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m29s)

[follow.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m30s)

[Scared me for a moment there. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m33s)

[not a bad thing, though. Okay. So, this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m36s)

[guy here is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m39s)

[Yeah. standard initialization](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m42s)

[demo structure. Yeah. So, you're an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m46s)

[idiot, Copilot.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m49s)

[I told you what it was and you didn't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m51s)

[listen. Okay. So, I want this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m52s)

[here like that. Um, and what did it do?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h28m57s)

[I think I'm just going to do something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m04s)

[similar where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m07s)

[uh let's see here. We don't need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m10s)

[that or that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m14s)

[And let's do XML like that just for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m16s)

[syntax highlighting for the moment.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m18s)

[Sure. Fix the the quoting problem. Thank](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m21s)

[you. Thank you. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m24s)

[do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m27s)

[Thank you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m29s)

[We're going to do light theme here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m31s)

[And then, yeah, sure. Thank you. Then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m35s)

[we're not going to do the color adjust](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m38s)

[stuff. We're going to leave that off for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m40s)

[now. Keep it simple, stupid. Keep it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m41s)

[simple, stupid.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m43s)

[Uh, okay. So, that's all that did. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m45s)

[then it needs to get the full path to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m47s)

[both of those DLs. Did it capture that?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m49s)

[Given that it didn't figure out the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m52s)

[thing above, I am not hopeful. Well, it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m53s)

[did figure out the window. Right.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h29m57s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m01s)

[it did look at create window width. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m02s)

[we may end up needing We're going to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m05s)

[need to expose something about the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m06s)

[window, too. I'm realizing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m12s)

[Yeah. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m17s)

[uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m22s)

[so I want to do something.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m28s)

[This I'm going to put above and we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m31s)

[going to do something a little](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m34s)

[different. When starting an app, use the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m35s)

[following resource uh structure for the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m39s)

[uh application](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m45s)

[ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m48s)

[and include the material design theme](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m50s)

[there. And then for the window, we're](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m52s)

[going to need to do](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m54s)

[that is I think basically what we had](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h30m57s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m01s)

[Yep.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m05s)

[Create window with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m10s)

[I wonder why](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m13s)

[why do I have both of these functions?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m18s)

[What's the difference? One of these](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m20s)

[takes in name spaces and one of them](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m21s)

[just has ZAML. Why can't I collapse them](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m23s)

[together?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m26s)

[Oh, because one of these is generic.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m27s)

[So, it's expecting to be able to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m30s)

[leverage that and pull back a specific](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m32s)

[type, whereas the other one isn't.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m36s)

[Interesting. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m40s)

[Okay. This one shows zero references.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m42s)

[I'm wondering if I've actually killed](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m46s)

[off its usage and I don't need them both](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m47s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m50s)

[So, that that guy can probably die.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m51s)

[Um, create with user control. The the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m55s)

[one reference is also what's giving me](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h31m58s)

[pause because it doesn't make sense that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m00s)

[there's only one reference. There should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m01s)

[be a lot more than that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m03s)

[Should be a lot more than that.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m05s)

[Why?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m15s)

[Okay. Well, let's start here. Uh, it did](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m17s)

[that. We need the assembly paths](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m21s)

[and the user asked to preview a button.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m26s)

[No, don't do any of that. Error handling](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m28s)

[limitations](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m30s)

[uh with WPF ZAML only.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m32s)

[I don't know. That's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m36s)

[requires material design name material](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m38s)

[color assemblies. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m40s)

[the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h32m52s)

[Let's see. Do you now show up? Just to](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h33m14s)

[make sure. Zaml test. Good. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h33m16s)

[There we go. That gets me there. Now you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m12s)

[should show up properly. Good.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m16s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m20s)

[I do need to expose the Windows ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m27s)

[What does the material design library](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m36s)

[do? It ends up calling with its own](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m39s)

[arbitrary window.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m42s)

[So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m48s)

[what did it what did it write it close](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m53s)

[is the question.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m56s)

[Is it close?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h34m58s)

[So when creating a window blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m03s)

[it's put in the material design stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m05s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m24s)

[now wondering if I should have a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m36s)

[anymore. I like I think I want this.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m44s)

[Okay. I think we want to duplicate this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m49s)

[cuz I think what I want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m52s)

[uh start app with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h35m56s)

[window ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m07s)

[I'm going to get rid of that description](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m10s)

[because that's wrong. I want that for](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m13s)

[both of those. I don't want this. These](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m16s)

[guys I want to get rid of on this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m19s)

[There's never a time where I would need](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m32s)

[these if I'm just going for simple. So,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m34s)

[we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m37s)

[and that can stay as it is. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m42s)

[and then we have window ZAML there. And](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m46s)

[so the material design library it just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m49s)

[calls create window with ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m52s)

[So we want to do create window and pass](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m55s)

[in uh window ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h36m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h37m03s)

[Okay. See if it handles that. Okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h37m20s)

[So, that'll get us to there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h37m24s)

[that should get me further](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h38m36s)

[let's start the server. And I should see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h38m53s)

[five tools here rather than four.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h38m58s)

[It should find the new one.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m06s)

[And we're going to switch to our new](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m10s)

[agent.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m11s)

[Five tools. Great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m21s)

[Okay. So we are going to new chat this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m24s)

[uh write a new or](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m28s)

[login button.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m40s)

[So it's going to pull in that agent MD](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m44s)

[and it should do everything. kind of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m49s)

[want to go look at that thinking stuff](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m51s)

[here in a second to see exactly what it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m53s)

[what it thought through. But I would](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m56s)

[expect it to leverage that agent MD](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h39m58s)

[start app. It's land. So it is landing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m08s)

[on the the new endpoint.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m10s)

[Um it has done a lot of stuff.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m13s)

[It has found the right output directory](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m17s)

[for the DLS.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m20s)

[Okay, send it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m24s)

[Oh, boo.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m28s)

[An error occurred. Let me try with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m31s)

[release build paths. I don't think](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m33s)

[that's the problem.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m35s)

[I think the more likely problem is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m38s)

[you've probably botched your ZAML.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m39s)

[But if you want to try with release](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m44s)

[pads, that's okay.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m45s)

[It's kind of hard to see with all that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m54s)

[XML shoved in there,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h40m57s)

[but it should launch.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m05s)

[Come on. I just want you to launch once](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m14s)

[for me. Make me feel happy.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m16s)

[What are you doing, co-pilot? What are](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m22s)

[you doing?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m23s)

[Pass manage over here and take a look](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m26s)

[doing anything interesting or you just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m28s)

[hanging out?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m31s)

[The fact that we just sit here and spin](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m36s)

[does not fill me with confidence,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m38s)

[but the CPU is not zero. So, it's doing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m44s)

[something](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m47s)

[questionable on whether the something's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m49s)

[useful or not.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m51s)

[Come on, Copilot. You can do this. I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m54s)

[believe in you. I believe in you.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h41m56s)

[kill it. Uh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m12s)

[try again.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m14s)

[I don't know whether that's an issue of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m16s)

[Oh, so it's going to go through and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m30s)

[compile. Okay, great.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m32s)

[I guess](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m35s)

[I guess that is a good point. I don't](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m37s)

[know that I ever actually compiled the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m38s)

[material design one. Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m40s)

[oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m45s)

[project has build errors. Let me try the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m48s)

[demo app that's already available. Oh,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m50s)

[we're going to get hosed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m53s)

[We're going to get hosed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m55s)

[Crap. Okay, so remember I had to make a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h42m59s)

[change to the global.json JSON so that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m02s)

[when this thing kicks off a net process,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m05s)

[it kicks off the net process with net 10](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m09s)

[because my MCP](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m14s)

[is using net 10. However, we have the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m16s)

[net 10 bug](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m20s)

[in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m26s)

[inside of WPF that prevents this library](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m30s)

[from compiling with .NET 10. Oh. Oh. Um](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m33s)

[yeah, let me try to use the the demo app](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m42s)

[that's already available.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m45s)

[Uh that's probably not going to work.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m48s)

[Copilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m51s)

[that is that is going to be an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m53s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m55s)

[problem.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m57s)

[So it's just a compiler error just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h43m58s)

[what does that mean we can do?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m03s)

[Can we work around this in some](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m06s)

[interesting way?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m12s)

[Does this support a working directory?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m16s)

[Because that would solve my problem,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m20s)

[current working directory.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m26s)

[If I put you here](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m34s)

[and then I get rid of this,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m40s)

[that solves my problem because I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m43s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Copilot, shut up and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m46s)

[stop. I'm going to fix this. I'm going](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m48s)

[to fix it for you](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m49s)

[because running the Yeah. Cancel.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m52s)

[Thanks. Because running this thing from](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m56s)

[a from the same directory is what is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h44m59s)

[biting me.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m02s)

[But I can come down here now](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m05s)

[and I can go into the material design](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m09s)

[project and I can come in here and I can](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m11s)

[say revert the global.json](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m14s)

[because I have net 10 like I have all](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m19s)

[the SDKs installed that are needed.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m22s)

[So now if I go to run this, it should](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m25s)

[launch and it should launch in the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m29s)

[it should launch inside of](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m35s)

[um the net process that is available at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m41s)

[the ZAML](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m44s)

[um test library which it does not have a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m46s)

[version restriction down](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m50s)

[to nine.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m53s)

[Okay. So, let's go back up here, change](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m56s)

[you to ZAML test agent, and send it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h45m59s)

[Uh, that is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m18s)

[something I am not convinced it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m24s)

[restarted properly. Let's go here. Let's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m27s)

[go here. Let's switch into the right](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m31s)

[agent](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m33s)

[and then send it.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m35s)

[I think I can turn off the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m39s)

[include current file. I might have to go](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m42s)

[into the settings.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m44s)

[So it's thinking through like it's](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m48s)

[building out the right ZAML there.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m50s)

[So it is getting the right information](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m57s)

[from all of that which is good.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h46m59s)

[Call start app.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m02s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m07s)

[I just want to see you work. I just want](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m11s)

[to see you work. I don't ask for much](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m13s)

[co-pilot. I just want you to do all the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m15s)

[things.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m18s)

[But I can also feel myself fading fast.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m20s)

[So, it may be nice to try and get this](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m24s)

[done because it is almost 2:00 a.m. my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m26s)

[time.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m29s)

[It's getting a little late](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m31s)

[because as exciting as my Tuesday was](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m36s)

[where I pulled a 19-hour day, I'd like](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m38s)

[to not replicate that consistently. That](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m40s)

[sounds bad.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m43s)

[So, it's doing the thing](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m48s)

[like that. Looks correct to me. Just](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m54s)

[brief glance. Obviously, I'm guessing at](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m56s)

[this ZAML because I'm trying to parse it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h47m59s)

[in my head as it goes.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m02s)

[I'm trying to decide if there is a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m07s)

[problem here.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m11s)

[like I should be able to find then](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m13s)

[process](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m15s)

[that is started.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m17s)

[There's a bunch of net processes running](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m20s)

[on my machine right now which is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m22s)

[part of the issue is I don't know which](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m27s)

[like why it's just spinning.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m29s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m33s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m37s)

[I don't know if there's an issue with my](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m42s)

[MCP where it's failing to launch or hang](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m44s)

[on something. That's not helpful.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m48s)

[Very difficult to debug.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m52s)

[Yeah, shut up. I understand.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h48m58s)

[So](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m02s)

[demo test](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m09s)

[cancel request five per](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m13s)

[called. Yeah, you do a thing, you go.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m28s)

[You seem hung.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m36s)

[And I have no explanation as to why.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m39s)

[What is this one?](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m44s)

[Uh let's see. Provide value through an](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m51s)

[exception, which makes sense.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m54s)

[I may need to start trapping those](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h49m59s)

[exceptions and returning a proper error.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m01s)

[And maybe I should do that here because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m08s)

[I'm not confident](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m11s)

[that I'm actually working](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m13s)

[start.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m22s)

[There's all of that and it is up and](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m35s)

[running. So, I'm going to clear one more](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m37s)

[try. Copilot. This This is really not a](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m39s)

[call that should take you very long.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m43s)

[Yep. You tried with a snippet.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h50m53s)

[I'm fine with you compiling. which is](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m01s)

[probably something you should have done](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m03s)

[in the first place cuz I don't know the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m05s)

[state of the DLS that were in my bin](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m06s)

[directory before](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m08s)

[and maybe I should add that information](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m14s)

[in. One of the other things that I enjoy](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m16s)

[doing is um once I get a co-pilot](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m18s)

[session that actually works, I will have](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m23s)

[Copilot go back and update either the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m24s)

[prompt or the custom agent file with](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m28s)

[anything that it's learned from the](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m30s)

[current run because often times that](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m32s)

[will it it knows what improvements it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m35s)

[needs to make.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m38s)

[So I will just have it iterate on itself](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m40s)

[and say go update your own markdown](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m42s)

[file.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m44s)

[and usually feeding that markdown file](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m46s)

[as context in](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m48s)

[I see the process count change but I](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h51m59s)

[don't see](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m02s)

[it seems like it's hanging somewhere](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m07s)

[inside my MCP and I don't know where](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m09s)

[that is.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m12s)

[I'm tempted to do a debugger launch](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m14s)

[inside here to try to grab it](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m17s)

[because I think it must be inside of one](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m26s)

[of these, right? Like it could be inside](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m30s)

[of initialize. I don't think so because](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m32s)

[initialize with defaults just calls](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m36s)

[initialize under the hood.](https://youtu.be/l-afZd_yiTQ?t=04h52m38s)
