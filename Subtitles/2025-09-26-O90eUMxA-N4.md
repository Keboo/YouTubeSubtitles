[Hello everyone. Uh it has been a very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m03s)

[long time and uh I do apologize for my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m06s)

[absence. I have dove in head first into](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m09s)

[uh remodeling my office. So anybody who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m14s)

[didn't catch the the very last stream, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m15s)

[think it's close to two months ago now.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m18s)

[Um, I I moved last September and since](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m20s)

[then I had set my computer up uh in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m23s)

[very unfinished basement and it is now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m27s)

[at the point where it is much closer to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m30s)

[finished. So, uh this is my my maiden](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m33s)

[voyage. I just got everything set up and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m37s)

[ready to rock uh this week or yeah, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m39s)

[guess over the weekend. Um and so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m43s)

[hopefully everything's dialed in. um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m45s)

[haven't had a lot of opportunity to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m48s)

[test. It's been very very busy. Most of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m50s)

[my free time has been occupied with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m52s)

[remodeling this basement rather than](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m56s)

[doing coding, which](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h00m57s)

[um anyone who knows me knows that I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m00s)

[twitch if I don't get an opportunity to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m01s)

[spend enough time coding. So, it has](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m03s)

[been a lot, but we are we are finally](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m05s)

[here. But updates updates because I have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m08s)

[a slew of stuff now. Uh because it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m12s)

[it's been a little while. It has been a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m15s)

[little while since I had had this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m17s)

[opportunity. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m20s)

[um, first of all, I am confused why I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m22s)

[don't have those turned on.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m26s)

[Um, there's the social links. There we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m29s)

[go. Okay, up and running. So, let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m32s)

[let's dive in and do uh a couple things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m35s)

[really quick. So, first and foremost,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m38s)

[and if I can remember how to do this,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m41s)

[uh, I'll go here. So, um, for anyone who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m44s)

[has missed it, I had the the pleasure of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m48s)

[being able to sit down with Mads](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m51s)

[Christensen, who is on the Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m53s)

[team to discuss Visual Studio 2026. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h01m56s)

[at this point, I have uninstalled VS](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m00s)

[2022 because I typically have been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m04s)

[running preview builds anyway.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m06s)

[The Visual Studio preview builds are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m08s)

[generally stable enough for me to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m10s)

[day-to-day work on and I've got a lot of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m12s)

[freedom and as long as I am productive,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m15s)

[I can run whichever edition makes sense.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m16s)

[And so I VS 2026 has a lot of really](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m19s)

[nice performance improvements to it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m24s)

[Like it just feels faster. um like some](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m26s)

[of those kind of like long lags that you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m30s)

[occasionally get with VS 2022 like those](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m32s)

[just have been smoothed over so much](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m35s)

[more in 2026. So it um it just I I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m37s)

[yummy might be the word uh Mads used in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m42s)

[the video. So if you haven't seen it,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m45s)

[check out my video link in the chat or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m47s)

[um you can see my YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m50s)

[YouTube.dev](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m52s)

[will get you to my thing. It's the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m54s)

[latest video that's posted out there.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m56s)

[Um, this was an absolute pleasure. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h02m58s)

[I have to apologize to Mads because if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m03s)

[you look very closely, you will note](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m06s)

[that there is a difference between the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m07s)

[the title here and the name that I put](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m10s)

[on him on screen and I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m12s)

[kick myself for doing that. And it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m16s)

[wasn't pointed out to me until after it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m18s)

[had been live for a little bit and I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m19s)

[like, um, I'm not going to pull it down.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m21s)

[But yes, that was a very unintentional](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m22s)

[mistake.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m24s)

[um on my part. So, I had kind of rushed](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m26s)

[when the opportunity came up. I kind of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m29s)

[threw my my streaming setup together](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m31s)

[kind of ad hoc going I I I don't like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m34s)

[guess I'm going to try to set something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m37s)

[up here in a few days to get this ready](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m38s)

[to go. We're doing it. So, we did it and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m40s)

[it was great. So, really awesome. If you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m42s)

[want to hear about kind of his](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m44s)

[perspective of uh some of the new](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m46s)

[features, uh obviously I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m49s)

[coding in it. We're going to show some](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m51s)

[of those features straight up. Um, so if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m53s)

[you haven't checked it out, check it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m56s)

[out.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m57s)

[Um, next, VS Code Dev Days. Now, this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h03m59s)

[probably unfortunately for most people](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m03s)

[watching this video, you are probably](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m04s)

[watching this after the date and you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m07s)

[aren't local. But in the hypothetical](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m10s)

[situation that you are watching this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m13s)

[before September 30th, 2025, and you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m14s)

[happen to be local to the Spokane,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m17s)

[Washington area, we have a local uh VS](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m19s)

[Code dev days happening in Spokane,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m23s)

[Washington.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m27s)

[Uh I assume this is going to open up and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m29s)

[it is being presented at Intellletch. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m32s)

[am the lead presenter.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m35s)

[I will be there. It's going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m38s)

[talking. Now, it's specifically VS Code](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m40s)

[dev days. So, this is going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m43s)

[effectively how to get the most out of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m45s)

[your VS Code. Obviously, C-Pilot is a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m47s)

[very big uh tool in terms of VS Code](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m50s)

[productivity. So, that is going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m54s)

[featured very heavily, but it isn't uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m56s)

[necessarily a uh GitHub copilot,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h04m58s)

[although that not shockingly will be a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m02s)

[very large part of it. So again, I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m05s)

[guessing most people are going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m08s)

[watching this uh either after the date](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m09s)

[or not local. So sorry, but I at least](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m11s)

[mentioned it. Um, okay, last one. This](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m15s)

[one is probably more relevant for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m18s)

[people. So the spokan.net user group.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m20s)

[Again, you'll note sponsored by Intell.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m24s)

[There's a theme in case you haven't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m26s)

[figured it out. Um, if you poke around](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m28s)

[long enough, you'll figure out where I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m31s)

[work. But Ben is going to be giving a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m32s)

[talk on le on building MCP servers and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m35s)

[um this is going to be really cool. Ben](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m40s)

[has been doing a ton of work around the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m45s)

[so uh central I think I've shown this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m48s)

[site off before. So, essential C#arp.com](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m52s)

[is a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m56s)

[uh a book series, though really you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h05m58s)

[probably just want the latest version.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m00s)

[If you if you're asking which edition](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m03s)

[you want, well, you probably want the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m04s)

[latest one because if you grab one of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m05s)

[the older ones, it covers an older](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m07s)

[version of C# and there's always been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m08s)

[new features in new C# versions. Um the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m10s)

[the last print edition is here and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m13s)

[you'll note, you know, secretly, hey,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m15s)

[look, there's my name. Uh, so I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m18s)

[biased, but the there's been a lot of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m20s)

[updates. Um, and so as things change,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m23s)

[the website gets updated first, which is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m26s)

[kind of cool. Wow, that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m28s)

[might have to go adjust my my camera.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m32s)

[Apparently, my screen is really whiting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m34s)

[my head out. Let's try. No, that's not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m37s)

[working. Let's try if I dial that down a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m41s)

[little bit.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m44s)

[Is that better? I don't know if that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m45s)

[better or worse.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m47s)

[H I might have to I might have to we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m49s)

[might have to do some ad hoc camera work](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m51s)

[here. This is this is the problem when I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m53s)

[haven't had a lot of time to test this.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m55s)

[Uh if I just move this off to the side.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m56s)

[Even better. There we go. Um but there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h06m59s)

[is quite a bit of work that goes into](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m01s)

[converting a book into a website. Like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m05s)

[this is not a trivial thing to do. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m08s)

[the amount of code that it took to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m11s)

[this is significant. It's not just as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m14s)

[simple as take source material, format](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m16s)

[it nicely in HTML because there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m20s)

[actually a full CI/CD so that as content](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m23s)

[changes for the book happen, they end up](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m26s)

[in the right place. There's a lot of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m28s)

[work that goes into say hypothetically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m30s)

[building a table of contents for the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m32s)

[physical printed book because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m34s)

[you change a few things and everything](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m38s)

[shifts and not having to renumber](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m40s)

[everything and having that all occur](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m42s)

[magically like there's a there's a chunk](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m44s)

[of work that goes into all that and it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m46s)

[a pain in the neck. So, I don't know how](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m48s)

[deep he's going to dive into it, but he](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m50s)

[has been putting in quite a bit of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m52s)

[stuff. Um, you'll note the AI chat in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m54s)

[here which is grounded in all of this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m57s)

[material. So, if you want an easy way of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h07m59s)

[being able to leverage it, this is an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m00s)

[awesome resource to do. Okay, that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m03s)

[source is bothering me. So, give me one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m06s)

[moment and we are going to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m09s)

[going to I'm going to just play around](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m13s)

[real quick with my camera](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m16s)

[and see if I can adjust this filter in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m20s)

[properly so that it's not quite as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m24s)

[aggressive.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m29s)

[Because when you change your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m32s)

[there. Maybe there. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m39s)

[Wow,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m51s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h08m56s)

[why is it picking up so much extra there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m02s)

[when I don't see it? Uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m07s)

[and out of the screen. We might go there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m16s)

[for now and then I will just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m18s)

[I might I might play around with this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m21s)

[and and and keep fussing with it on the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m23s)

[fly and we will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m26s)

[I will probably need to play around with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m29s)

[this a bit more. So turn that sucker](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h09m30s)

[Ben actually the guy who is giving the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h10m45s)

[user group talk I think over the like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h10m47s)

[the last 6 months I think it's fair to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h10m49s)

[he's been the the brains behind like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h10m57s)

[some of the um account stuff the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m00s)

[referral links, the AI chat, um a lot of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m02s)

[content updates, the MCP stuff, um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m05s)

[uh let's see, you're the author of the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m11s)

[UI kit, right? Uh so if you are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m12s)

[referring to material design in ZAML,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m15s)

[specifically this guy here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m18s)

[then the answer uh is yes. Um I'm at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m22s)

[least I'm at least the maintainer of it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m26s)

[I am not the original author, but I have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m28s)

[been the the prime maintainer of it for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m30s)

[like I don't know six, seven years at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m33s)

[this point. It's been a little while.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m35s)

[It's been it's been it's it's been a hot](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m37s)

[minute. Um but yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m39s)

[so and that one we will jump into in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m42s)

[minute. So So yeah, if if people are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m46s)

[interested, definitely check that out.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m48s)

[Okay. I feel like there was something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m51s)

[else I wanted to to plug while I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m52s)

[going through all of my stuff. I It's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m55s)

[been two months. I've got two months](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m57s)

[worth of stuff. Like I feel like there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h11m58s)

[all these update things that I that I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m01s)

[miss doing. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m02s)

[uh web web form apps for Windows. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m05s)

[the the web stuff that I've typically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m10s)

[worked on at least on stream I've often](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m13s)

[done Blazer stuff. So not necessarily](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m15s)

[that similar uh Windows forms. Um, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m20s)

[have done](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m23s)

[I've done I've done enough Windows forms](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m25s)

[to be dangerous. My very first um job](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m27s)

[out of university was building a Windows](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m31s)

[Forms application. Um, and that was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m33s)

[shortly before WPF released. And then um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m36s)

[after WPF released, the company](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m41s)

[transitioned to a WPF app. And so I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m43s)

[then part of converting a Windforms app](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m46s)

[into a WPF app, which we kind of we did](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m48s)

[the thing that Microsoft said not to do.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m52s)

[We did a complete big bang rewrite of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m53s)

[the whole UI layer.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m55s)

[So it was like three weeks of me and the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h12m58s)

[team just busting through it. Now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m01s)

[admittedly, the app was only like a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m04s)

[year, year and a half old, which I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m05s)

[want to downplay it because there was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m09s)

[quite a bit there, but it wasn't huge](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m10s)

[yet, right? Like Because in a year, year](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m13s)

[and a half only some of that time was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m16s)

[developing the the front end and there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m18s)

[were there was enough stuff that we had](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m21s)

[had to do in Windforms. Like Windforms](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m22s)

[was great because if you wanted to just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m24s)

[start arbitrarily painting controls, you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m27s)

[can do that and it was easy. But the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m29s)

[problem is is there were it was like you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m32s)

[were either in the happy path or you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m34s)

[were at the low-level painting path and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m36s)

[like compositing controls wasn't trivial](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m38s)

[at the time. Like I know there's been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m40s)

[some improvements to Windforms to make](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m42s)

[it easier, but WPF made it so trivial](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m44s)

[with templates and whatnot that as soon](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m47s)

[as we saw that, we're like, uh, yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m49s)

[we're we're jumping in on that. We are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m51s)

[absolutely jumping in on that. Okay. Oh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m54s)

[that's right. Kraken. Kraken. Hang on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m56s)

[one second. I got to switch this over.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h13m59s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m04s)

[So, let me pop a couple things on my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m06s)

[stack here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m09s)

[See where this is going. See where this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m11s)

[is going. I got to kill some tabs.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m13s)

[Uh, yeah, that'll work. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m16s)

[Get Kraken has had like a bunch of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m21s)

[releases. So, I'm going to move myself](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m23s)

[over to here. So, I'm going to be on the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m26s)

[other side for a moment. So, just to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m28s)

[clear on this one. Whoa, that's the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m30s)

[wrong screen. Let's try that again.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m32s)

[See this? This is how you can tell I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m39s)

[haven't done this in a while. I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m41s)

[getting real sloppy real fast.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m42s)

[I'm getting real sloppy.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m46s)

[Um, and I'm going to go back into here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m49s)

[And I want to take this guy and dial him](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m53s)

[up just a little bit more. That makes me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m56s)

[feel better. Okay. Way I'm not getting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h14m59s)

[quite as much spill. Getting a little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m02s)

[bit of back stuff coming through, but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m03s)

[whatever. we will work with it. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m05s)

[so the the thing that I was attempting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m09s)

[to do here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m11s)

[uh, let's see. And then I want to go,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m13s)

[sorry, playing with my streaming stuff.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m16s)

[Shouldn't do that live. Anyway, uh, so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m19s)

[the key thing here, I am on 1140. So if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m21s)

[you are uh, not on latest. The other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m24s)

[thing to note is I do have an enterprise](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m26s)

[skew license that I am I am pow-wowing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m29s)

[on. So just just to call things out. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m31s)

[Git Kraken did something kind of cool](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m34s)

[with their approach to um AI stuff. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m36s)

[underneath the preference, the Git](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m40s)

[Kraken AI, uh you get this usage](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m41s)

[details, which for a long time, I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m45s)

[know why people didn't show this, but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m47s)

[the important thing here is this little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m49s)

[word week, right? So, rather than most](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m51s)

[things where it's like monthly where you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m55s)

[burn through your tokens, it's like,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m57s)

[well, I guess I'm dead for the rest of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m58s)

[the month. Like the idea with doing it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h15m59s)

[with weak was so that go ahead and use](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m02s)

[it because even if you use them up like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m06s)

[you're going to be ready to go very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m09s)

[shortly again here. Now obviously I have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m12s)

[a ton. They've added in a couple SKs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m14s)

[because there's pro team and there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m17s)

[something new before enterprise. There's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m21s)

[like four tiers where there used to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m23s)

[three. But regardless, um the other key](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m24s)

[thing to note here is if you are in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m28s)

[situation where it's like, oh, you know,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m31s)

[my company doesn't let me go to, you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m33s)

[know, somebody else's AI server, I I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m36s)

[need to do this. Because when you use](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m38s)

[Git Kraken's AI for things like generate](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m40s)

[commit message or things like that, like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m43s)

[it does have to send like the the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m45s)

[changes to be able to generate that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m49s)

[information. Like it's not happening](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m51s)

[locally. So they've got a whole page on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m52s)

[their security stuff. If if it's just a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m55s)

[matter of saying, hey, you know, are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m58s)

[people are they handling your data](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h16m59s)

[securely? The answer is yes. They've got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m00s)

[a page talking about it if people want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m02s)

[more details. But if you need to run](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m04s)

[something local, you can easily drop](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m06s)

[into your own instance here. You can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m09s)

[even do something custom, go against](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m13s)

[local host and just pile away, right?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m16s)

[Like if you've got Olama running locally](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m19s)

[or you've got Azure AI Foundry running](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m21s)

[local, you can just send it there and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m24s)

[then it never leaves your box, right? So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m26s)

[you don't have to necessarily give it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m29s)

[up. There is a skew limit on who can do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m30s)

[this dropdown though.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m34s)

[I think you get it in Pro, but don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m37s)

[quote me on that. I might I might have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m39s)

[to to double check this. And obviously](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m41s)

[the the organization admin that only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m44s)

[exists once you get up to levels with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m47s)

[orgs. So for that thing um the other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m49s)

[thing like prompt injection if you're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m53s)

[building on AI stuff is a potentially](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m55s)

[bug. In this case it's a feature. This](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h17m58s)

[they literally built prompt injection](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m01s)

[boxes in here for you to be able to go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m02s)

[through and say oh hey by the way I want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m04s)

[to add in some more stuff to add into](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m07s)

[the description. So, I've been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m10s)

[absolutely loving this and we'll get to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m12s)

[their um rebuild commits thing because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m14s)

[it is gold in my opinion. Uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m18s)

[specifically the compose commits with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m21s)

[AI. This is like AI automated rebase](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m23s)

[which is like for anybody who who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m26s)

[watches this for a while, I am in the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m29s)

[rebase over the merge commit camp. So on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m31s)

[that debate, that's where I land. I feel](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m34s)

[like that's what people need. They](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m36s)

[people devs like need a little thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m37s)

[like are you a tabs or spaces person](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m39s)

[or or you know there's obviously a don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m42s)

[care option or are you uh uh a rebase](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m44s)

[versus merge etc etc etc. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m49s)

[trying to remember what it's been so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m52s)

[bloody long since I was even in some of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m54s)

[these cuz the other thing is is I like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m56s)

[this machine has been shut down for two](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h18m58s)

[months. I've been rolling on my other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m01s)

[machine. So, some of this stuff if it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m03s)

[looks old, it's cuz it is. It's cuz it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m05s)

[is. Okay. But we have we got PRs out](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m07s)

[here and we got stuff to do. We got a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m11s)

[release that probably needs to get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m14s)

[rocking and rolling and it's going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m15s)

[great.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m18s)

[Okay. Okay. Let's start in on this.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m21s)

[I feel like there was something else I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m25s)

[was going to mention and I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m27s)

[remember what it was there. I'm It'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m29s)

[come to me later and then I will just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m31s)

[like when I scream out something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m33s)

[randomly. That's what it is. So, uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m34s)

[okay. So, let's let's take a little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m38s)

[gander here at uh well, I guess I've got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m40s)

[the remote open out here. Or I guess](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m44s)

[we've got pull requests listed right](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m46s)

[here. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m47s)

[actually I kind of want to get back. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m50s)

[the tree data grid one I think was the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m51s)

[one that I wanted to look at first](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m53s)

[because this one is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h19m56s)

[very hotly recommended](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m00s)

[and I think we I'm I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m04s)

[remember where we went because we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m06s)

[reviewed this once before](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m10s)

[and then we went back and forth](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m12s)

[and then this one here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m16s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m22s)

[you don't mind.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m24s)

[I don't know that this comment can be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m29s)

[removed. We'll double check this. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m32s)

[and I do want to just validate it on a a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m35s)

[large data set, but I I know we went](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m37s)

[through this before. So, let's pull this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m39s)

[guy down and let's let's check this guy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m40s)

[out. So, let's see. Uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m45s)

[and I realize my big head is once again](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m48s)

[in the way. So, right click on the pull](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m50s)

[request, add remote, and check out.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m52s)

[Uh, let's see. Already exist. Yeah, put](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h20m58s)

[my local branch there because I'm sure I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m01s)

[checked this out once before. I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m02s)

[care where my local is. There we go.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m04s)

[There we go. So, we got some stuff. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m07s)

[then control shift E. So, oh, like,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m10s)

[isn't it pretty? And of course it loads](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m12s)

[on the wrong screen, but that's a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m14s)

[different problem. That is a different](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m16s)

[problem. So, uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m18s)

[okay, I don't know my window layout in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m22s)

[this thing. So, um, one thing I will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m25s)

[point out because I've shown this to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m27s)

[people multiple times. I very much like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m29s)

[B. So, Git Kraken has the ability of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m32s)

[open repo in external editor, right?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m35s)

[This control shift E, which is what I am](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m37s)

[triggering.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m39s)

[Uh, let's see. I believe that is in the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m41s)

[where's the external tools. So I had](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m46s)

[forgotten about this that I had bound it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m49s)

[up this way because I point this to my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m52s)

[my dev env.exe which is Visual Studio,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m55s)

[right? Um and which is fine. It feeds in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h21m59s)

[the the repo path as the arguments by](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m02s)

[default which is great. You just point](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m04s)

[it there. But if you install new Visual](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m06s)

[Studio, this path changes specifically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m08s)

[because you'll note there's an 18 here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m12s)

[now. So I I installed um the the new](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m14s)

[version of Visual Studio, forgot that I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m19s)

[did this, went control shift E, and get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m21s)

[cracked and went I don't see it there. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m22s)

[went a shoot. So, um, if you are going](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m24s)

[to upgrade, my recommended path is thus,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m27s)

[um, install 2026 first, um, because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m31s)

[it'll allow you to import your settings](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m34s)

[from 2022.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m36s)

[Um, then when you're happy with it, if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m38s)

[you want to, you can just uninstall](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m41s)

[2022,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m43s)

[just straight up good to go. Um, which](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m45s)

[is what I ended up doing. It will import](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m48s)

[most of your settings aside from a few](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m50s)

[minor things. For example, the default](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m53s)

[position of solution explorer is still](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m56s)

[on the bloody right. I like for some](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h22m58s)

[reason that's not part of my settings](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m01s)

[and does not go to the left where it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m02s)

[belongs, which is where it belongs. Darn](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m04s)

[it. It's my strong opinion that the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m07s)

[solution explorer goes over here. Okay,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m11s)

[I will stop soap boxing. Let's see. I am](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m14s)

[on demo app. Launch demo app. The other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m17s)

[thing that I that I do want to go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m20s)

[through and spend a little bit of time](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m21s)

[on um because I've been doing a ton of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m23s)

[work in it at least in my day job and a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m25s)

[little bit on side stuff is net Aspire.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m27s)

[So for people who haven't seen it, it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m31s)

[Microsoft's,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m33s)

[it's the best way to describe it. It is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m35s)

[a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m38s)

[toolsinccluded](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m41s)

[way of building cloudnative](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m43s)

[applications. So there's a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m44s)

[that kind of comes in the box when you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m47s)

[build stuff with Aspire and you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m50s)

[either bolt it on to existing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m52s)

[applications or start a project fresh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m54s)

[but you get this idea of a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h23m57s)

[um an app host that is kind of like the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m00s)

[controller of all of your entire](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m04s)

[infrastructure. So it'll it'll handle](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m06s)

[things like if you have a database that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m09s)

[you want to launch in a a Docker](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m10s)

[container, it'll start that up for you.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m12s)

[If you've got like multiple](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m14s)

[microservices that need to start, it'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m15s)

[start that for you. Um, if you have say](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m17s)

[uh Azure storage account or similar,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m20s)

[it'll start that for you. But then it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m22s)

[can use that same host to generate](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m24s)

[because it now has a picture of your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m25s)

[whole app of what it takes. It can then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m27s)

[use that manifest to go as far as spin](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m30s)

[and deploy my cloud infrastructure for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m32s)

[me as well. So you can go from clone](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m34s)

[repo to up and running in Azure. And the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m37s)

[slow part is waiting for the Azure](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m41s)

[resources to spin up. So, it's it can be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m42s)

[really powerful and it comes with a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m45s)

[whole bunch of things in the box about](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m46s)

[how to do like logging, telemetry,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m48s)

[um being able to connect services](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m51s)

[together. And a lot of these pieces](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m54s)

[already existed pre-DNET Aspire, but you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m56s)

[kind of had to know how they all worked](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h24m59s)

[to plug them all together. like the I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m01s)

[configuration system that I like to use](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m04s)

[on my WPF apps that existed for a while,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m05s)

[but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m08s)

[having a system where it kind of is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m10s)

[already set up and things are plugged](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m12s)

[together and there's a lot of source](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m13s)

[generators and things to just make that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m14s)

[whole thing flow nicely is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m16s)

[okay. Uh tree grid view,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m22s)

[tree grid view. Okay, so multi select](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m25s)

[tree grid view. And if I remember right,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m28s)

[these two guys are bound to the same](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m30s)

[collections, which is yeah, that's why](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m32s)

[you see the selection going between](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m35s)

[them. And then I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m36s)

[is unselect with control and then just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m39s)

[So is that the same over here?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m43s)

[Nope. I want to undo that.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m47s)

[Oh, that's kind of annoying that we have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m50s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m53s)

[Okay. So, that's a that's a bug in the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m57s)

[demo app. And I'm a little It's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h25m59s)

[interesting to me that this thing here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m02s)

[shows](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m04s)

[Huh. I was just looking at like I see](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m09s)

[this max height and that's probably](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m13s)

[what's that's probably contributing to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m14s)

[this. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m17s)

[but I don't like that I've I've now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m20s)

[effectively lost my buttons.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m22s)

[But yeah, if I remember right, this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m25s)

[all fine. Let's go and take a look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m26s)

[the PR itself.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m29s)

[And then I we may clean up the the demo](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m33s)

[app just a hair. Um, so let's go here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m35s)

[and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m40s)

[this guy. So why did the pipeline fail?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m42s)

[There was there was a handful of issues](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m46s)

[around some changes to like the build](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m48s)

[agents. So, we may just need to kick](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m50s)

[this sucker again.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m52s)

[Um, and some of these some of these](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m54s)

[pipeline runs just may be old enough](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h26m56s)

[that like what was the so test failure.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m00s)

[So, there it could be a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m03s)

[flaky test as well, which I'm not happy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m07s)

[with when I find them. Blake key tests](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m10s)

[are bad and should be rooted out and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m13s)

[destroyed. Um, do I not have the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m15s)

[I don't think I have the GitHub logger,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m21s)

[do I?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m24s)

[Uh, let's see. Dragging thumb changes](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m29s)

[saturation. That was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m31s)

[uh Let's see. Details skip skips.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m34s)

[That's nice that I got all that marked](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m38s)

[as skipped.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m40s)

[Where is the failed one then?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m45s)

[My um I see the the logs with the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m49s)

[screenshots which means](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m52s)

[failed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m55s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h27m58s)

[split button with button and popup can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m00s)

[be invoked. So, we may we may look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m04s)

[this because that I'm gonna just gonna](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m07s)

[flag a notepad document here with that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m10s)

[in it because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m14s)

[that feels like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m16s)

[just grab this here. Throw that into my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m20s)

[document. We'll come back to it. Okay,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m24s)

[there's all of that. Let's go back to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m26s)

[the PR itself](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m29s)

[and then we'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m33s)

[I want to go through the code because I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m36s)

[think most of this was looking good from](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m38s)

[my feedback before.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m42s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m45s)

[okay. So, cuz before it was a new](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m54s)

[control, not just a control style. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m57s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h28m59s)

[take a look at.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m03s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m05s)

[okay. So, this is actually now been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m13s)

[switched.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m16s)

[I like that better.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m18s)

[I vaguely recall looking at this. So I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m22s)

[may have done this already, especially](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m26s)

[since all of these things are showing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m28s)

[checked.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m30s)

[Yeah, cuz this is the this is the key](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m34s)

[thing is looking for this view property.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m35s)

[And this is an unfortunate part with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m37s)

[when you style an existing WPF control](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m41s)

[is the control is kind of outside of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m44s)

[your control. Pun intended. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m46s)

[like we could spin a brand new control](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m50s)

[or we could just do battle with the way](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m57s)

[WPF was written with this view property.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h29m59s)

[It's I I think when it was initially](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m02s)

[designed, they probably had this idea](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m04s)

[that there was going to be different](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m06s)

[types of views and then they never added](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m07s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m10s)

[So, it's like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m12s)

[nice idea,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m14s)

[not practical. What was the comment](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m16s)

[here?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m18s)

[Yeah, cuz these these ones here were](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m20s)

[off, but I think the new one looks Let](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m23s)

[me relaunch and double check those](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m26s)

[margins. They they looked pretty close,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m27s)

[at least visually.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m31s)

[Yeah, I mean visually those things look](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m40s)

[So the like the only thing I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m52s)

[right is if I draw a straight line down](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m55s)

[on this B,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m57s)

[I think we may have actually gone a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h30m59s)

[little far one way because now if I draw](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m00s)

[straight down this B, I'm a little over](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m03s)

[because in an ideal situation, I'd love](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m07s)

[for these things to be aligned.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m08s)

[But I am aware that they're that they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m13s)

[are a bit off.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m15s)

[In either case, we may we may try to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m17s)

[tweak them just to get those a little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m19s)

[closer. But that's that's still very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m21s)

[very it it's close enough that I unless](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m24s)

[you put these grids side by side, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m28s)

[don't know that people would really](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m30s)

[notice.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m31s)

[Okay. Also,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m35s)

[new Mountain Dew flavor, dragon fruit.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m38s)

[It's good.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m42s)

[It doesn't usurp my Baja Blast. That is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m43s)

[the favorite, but you know, it's it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m46s)

[good. Like good enough that I that I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m49s)

[purchased several 12-packs and am happy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m52s)

[about it. Okay. So, let's let's go back](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m55s)

[to here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h31m58s)

[Um, okay. And let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m00s)

[So, this is where those bindings are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m03s)

[being placed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m06s)

[And because the unfortunate part is it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m09s)

[is it is slapping the chevron for the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m12s)

[expand inside of the the thing rather](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m15s)

[than outside because of the column](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m17s)

[headers. And I just like I looked at it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m19s)

[myself and couldn't come up with a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m22s)

[better way of doing it myself. Izzy,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m23s)

[welcome.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m25s)

[Welcome. Uh the the renovated space is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m28s)

[going well here. I actually Hang on.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m31s)

[Let me I I posted a couple pictures in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m36s)

[the Discord, but just just to show](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m38s)

[people,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m40s)

[here's what I started with, right? My my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m42s)

[my desk when I started was in this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m46s)

[little corner right here. Like,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m50s)

[ye ugly, ye ugly, right? Like these](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m53s)

[shelves were here. Concrete walls.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h32m57s)

[Ignore the water damage. We had it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m00s)

[inspected. It's fine.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m02s)

[all that stuff, right? Like this. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m04s)

[these shelves were not built to be taken](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m07s)

[apart. They they had nailed them from](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m09s)

[both directions and then 90 the nails](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m12s)

[off on both sides so that they couldn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m14s)

[be pulled out. I was I just started](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m16s)

[taking my my saws all to it and and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m18s)

[cutting like it was it was coming apart](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m21s)

[one way or another. Uh I was just trying](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m23s)

[to I I've been reusing some of the wood](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m26s)

[because they were actually fairly sturdy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m28s)

[shelves. Um, and so a lot of the wood](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m30s)

[has been repurposed, but you know,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m33s)

[that's where we started with.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m35s)

[We got the whole sucker torn down,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m38s)

[ripped open, like flat. Ignore my mess](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m40s)

[of Ethernet cables. Just pretend like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m43s)

[you didn't see that. And then, let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m46s)

[see. This is here's one starting to get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m49s)

[it framed in.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m52s)

[And then, let's see. We can jump forward](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m54s)

[in time.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m56s)

[I conned one of my um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h33m59s)

[one of my colleagues who is a former](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m03s)

[electrical engineer to come and help me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m06s)

[get some of the wiring stuff done](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m09s)

[especially around like the electrical](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m11s)

[box. This is looking at that same wall.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m13s)

[So I've jumped forward. We now have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m16s)

[walls up sheetrock.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m17s)

[Um we were uh painting the ceiling and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m20s)

[these guys up here. These things are now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m23s)

[painted brass. But along this wall over](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m25s)

[here, um, we are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m28s)

[we're we're putting in cabinets, but the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m32s)

[goal is to have it look like built-in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m34s)

[shelving units. So, that is actually](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m36s)

[part that's not done yet that I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m38s)

[actually working on just prior to the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m40s)

[stream. Um, let's see here. What else we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m42s)

[got?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m45s)

[What else we got in here? Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m46s)

[see what else I can find.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m49s)

[So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m51s)

[um this is the other half of that space.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m54s)

[So this wall here right this whole area](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h34m57s)

[here this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m01s)

[I am looking at it from the other side.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m04s)

[So before this was just one big open](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m07s)

[space and this thing here is going to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m09s)

[converted into we're calling it a media](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m12s)

[room because there there's no way like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m15s)

[don't have an exterior wall that I can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m17s)

[put a window on. So, I can never make](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m19s)

[this a legal bedroom or anything. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m21s)

[we're just gonna TV is going to get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m23s)

[mounted here. And you'll note this big](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m25s)

[ugly bit of concrete here. Very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m27s)

[obnoxious. Very obnoxious. We frame that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m29s)

[sucker in. And then, let me see if I've](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m33s)

[got a good picture of it. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m36s)

[I framed that guy in and then I had the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m40s)

[carpet guy just carpet the whole thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m44s)

[in. And you can see my wife is she is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m46s)

[the artistic one. So she is going](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m48s)

[through and doing she's going to do this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m51s)

[pattern all along the wall. As you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m54s)

[see she's going through there. She's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m56s)

[actually fairly close to finishing it at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h35m59s)

[this point. Um, but then like my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m00s)

[finished space on the other side](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m04s)

[cuz we we added this wall in the middle](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m07s)

[because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m10s)

[this was like I think 450 square ft](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m11s)

[total that we were renovating.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m15s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m18s)

[just put a PC monitor. It doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m21s)

[if it's Windows 10 or 11. Yeah, but the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m22s)

[thing is I have a TV. I have the TV to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m24s)

[mount. I just need to uh to grab it. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m27s)

[and then I should have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m31s)

[Yeah, there it is. Uh, sorry. I got to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m34s)

[wait for this thing to pull down. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m36s)

[cuz I didn't load all these in here. The](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m40s)

[on my office side because I like I I use](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m46s)

[the term office loosely. Um, we are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m51s)

[putting in a Murphy door as the entrance](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m54s)

[to it. So for people who haven't heard](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m56s)

[that term, think swinging bookcase](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h36m58s)

[instead of a door. So the problem being](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m00s)

[is I have to manufacture the bookcase](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m04s)

[because getting one that that's the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m06s)

[exact size to fit in my frame isn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m08s)

[happening. Um and so I'm I am standing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m11s)

[in said doorway when I took this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m16s)

[picture. But this is the other half of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m17s)

[my my office area. So behind my green](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m19s)

[screen. Yeah. A secret hidden door.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m23s)

[Exactly. That is the goal. Um, so this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m25s)

[is aside from the fact that there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m29s)

[tables and stuff stacked on them right](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m31s)

[now. This is what behind my green screen](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m33s)

[looks like. So I put uh hard floor down](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m35s)

[for my desk area cuz I want my rolly](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m38s)

[chair to to rolly. Um, but I also do um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m41s)

[a lot of board games and whatnot. And so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m45s)

[this area, like that's what these](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m47s)

[shelves are going to end up being is a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m49s)

[lot of board game storage. I I have to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m51s)

[build in these shelves probably this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m53s)

[weekend. Um my wife is obviously](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m55s)

[painting them because she is the art one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h37m57s)

[and I got to get everything anchored in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m00s)

[in place. There's a few more boards on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m02s)

[this that aren't here in this picture.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m03s)

[Um but yeah, so this this will be gaming](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m05s)

[area and whatnot when it is all said and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m09s)

[done. So, and then I guess there's two](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m12s)

[more that you'll probably appreciate.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m15s)

[Um, so this is flipping back over to the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m18s)

[media room. My wife found this painting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m21s)

[that she liked. Um, she was a little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m23s)

[annoyed that it wasn't centered on the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m26s)

[canvas or the canvas wasn't centered on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m27s)

[its frame, which was annoying. But then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m29s)

[what she did is she took a couple](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m32s)

[hinges](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m36s)

[and she covered up the the electrical](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m38s)

[box with it. So she made a she made a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m40s)

[nice way to hide the electrical box. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m44s)

[you know, I got a frame in the door. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m46s)

[she's got the the blue tape is painters](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m49s)

[tape. So, she is uh prepping for like a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m51s)

[a Wayne's coating thing or something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m54s)

[along the bottom. I I just build she she](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m55s)

[is in charge of all of the make it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h38m59s)

[pretty stuff because that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m00s)

[uh I I know that she is significantly](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m04s)

[better at that than I am. So, she gets](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m06s)

[to be in charge on the make it pretty](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m09s)

[front.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m11s)

[I just get to make it functional. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m12s)

[yeah. So that is So I am still hacking](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m14s)

[away at it and I thought it was going to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m17s)

[go by a lot quicker than it did, but it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m20s)

[is it is going well and I'm at least now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m23s)

[back into a functionalish state. At](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m26s)

[least I think I'm in a functionalist](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m29s)

[state. I feel like I'm in a better](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m30s)

[state. So there's that. Uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m33s)

[my kind of make it pretty spray paint it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m38s)

[black.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m40s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Well, she does have a paint](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m42s)

[sprayer. Um, that was actually what she](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m46s)

[asked for for Christmas last year was uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m48s)

[an actual sprayer to be able to go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m52s)

[through and do because be she's very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m54s)

[good by hand. Like she'll even paint](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m56s)

[little miniatures for our our board](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h39m59s)

[games and like she's got all the tiny](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m02s)

[little brushes and everything and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m05s)

[whatnot. Um, so she she's very much good](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m07s)

[at detail work. Um, and enjoys it. Um, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m10s)

[get frustrated by it and do not enjoy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m15s)

[it, which is why I let her do it. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m16s)

[cuz she actually finds it relaxing and I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m20s)

[find it stressful. So, we just let each](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m23s)

[other do the thing, the areas that we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m26s)

[find more enjoyable. Okay. So, I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m28s)

[this guy here is probably good. like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m33s)

[this is now much more akin to what I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m36s)

[expecting to see. We've got this kind of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m40s)

[ugliness around the grid view. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m42s)

[let's see. Andrew, quick unrelated](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m48s)

[question. Andrew, there are no unrelated](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m50s)

[questions. I'm happy to field whatever.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m51s)

[Uh, do you have any solid reasons why a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m53s)

[Windows desktop dev should dive into](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m56s)

[Azure?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h40m59s)

[I don't know if I would limit it to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m01s)

[Windows desktop dev or or maybe it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m03s)

[you're just saying somebody has a a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m07s)

[background in that. So, for me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m10s)

[personally, and this is an area that I I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m12s)

[was potentially going to explore a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m14s)

[little bit, um I feel like even desktop](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m16s)

[devs at least need to know enough to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m20s)

[deploy and connect to cloud services](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m23s)

[because it's it's rare that you don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m26s)

[have to do any sort of remote backend.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m28s)

[Like I realize this library is a a local](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m32s)

[desktop app and there's no there's no](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m35s)

[real database or anything behind it. it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m38s)

[just runs. And if all you're ever](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m40s)

[building is simple client-based](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m42s)

[applications where you can get away with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m44s)

[like a SQLite database or something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m46s)

[locally or even just local storage type](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m47s)

[situation, you might not care. But](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m50s)

[increasingly more and more uh like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m54s)

[Windows desktop devs at minimum need to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m56s)

[know how to consume cloud stuff. Um and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h41m59s)

[I think that's kind of level one is you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m04s)

[have to be able to consume it as a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m05s)

[desktop dev. And then level two is you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m07s)

[got to know how to spin it up. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m10s)

[yeah. Yeah. Izzy's comment too about](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m14s)

[single sign on preferences, those types](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m17s)

[of things. Like I think what I would say](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m19s)

[as my reasons would be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m21s)

[if I was looking at a dev to either help](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m25s)

[them guide them in a career or hire them](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m27s)

[or similar, I would say a dev that can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m29s)

[consume cloud resources is is level one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m33s)

[And then a dev that can spin up those](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m37s)

[same cloud resources is probably the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m39s)

[next level on top of that to be able to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m41s)

[to set it up because like say sign,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m44s)

[right? being able to set up um some sort](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m46s)

[of identity provider to so that you know](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m49s)

[calls to your API are appropriately](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m52s)

[authenticated and tied down to an AD](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m54s)

[group is probably worthwhile. I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m56s)

[know if I would necessarily say the dev](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h42m58s)

[has to dive into Azure though. Like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m02s)

[think most devs need to be fluent in at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m04s)

[in one of the big clouds and AWS and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m09s)

[Azure like that's going to cover most of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m12s)

[the market, right? Some people may make](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m15s)

[arguments for Google's cloud or Oracle's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m17s)

[or or similar, but I feel like those are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m20s)

[a little more niche. And so unless you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m22s)

[have a compelling reason not to go AWS](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m24s)

[or Azure,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m26s)

[I I would probably tell desktop devs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m28s)

[that you need to learn some cloud level](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m31s)

[stuff. Um especially with more and more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m34s)

[things requiring more compute power than](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m39s)

[what can be reasonably done on a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m41s)

[desktop. Like AI is the first one that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m44s)

[comes to mind. Like most people are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m46s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m48s)

[going to get into a situation where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m50s)

[their apps are expecting a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m52s)

[connectedbased environment and not just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m54s)

[something that runs local,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m57s)

[right? And some of the stuff you can get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h43m59s)

[away with like if you build like a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m01s)

[Windows Store app, the store does give](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m03s)

[you some stuff so that you don't have to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m05s)

[think about it. Um, but I again it kind](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m07s)

[of depends on what people are building.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m11s)

[But if you want to be building like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m13s)

[enterprise stuff, I think that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m15s)

[probably what I would what I would tell](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m18s)

[them is it's it's unlikely that your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m19s)

[desktop app lives as a standalone thing.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m22s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m26s)

[they get you on board than quintiple the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m28s)

[cost.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m31s)

[Yeah, that that's that's about right.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m34s)

[That is that is about right. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m36s)

[yeah, no no problem, Andrew. And yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m40s)

[and always feel free. I keep meaning to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m42s)

[go through and put a little thing in my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m45s)

[chat to to tell people that like I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m46s)

[mind offthe-wall qu well, let me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m50s)

[rephrase. As long as the question isn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m52s)

[like grossly inappropriate or similar,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m54s)

[like I'm happy to dive into to whatever,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h44m57s)

[right? So, it's it is all good. I I am](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m00s)

[very happy to rabbit trail on things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m04s)

[because some of my best streams have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m06s)

[come from people saying, "Hey, I got a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m08s)

[question." And so it's like, yeah, that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m10s)

[like those are always the good ones.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m13s)

[Okay, so I think I want to try to bump](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m15s)

[that sizing a little bit.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m17s)

[And let's just see if we if we dial this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m21s)

[sucker in. So let me grab our old pal](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m23s)

[Snoop](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m27s)

[because we obviously need Snoop. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m30s)

[then I want to So it's really](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m33s)

[disappointing the the the monitor that I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m36s)

[use. So, right before I stopped](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m38s)

[streaming, one of my monitors died on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m41s)

[me, and I was very, very sad, and I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m44s)

[don't know what happened to it. However,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m46s)

[my brother-in-law then said, "Hey, you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m49s)

[need a monitor. I'm getting rid of one."](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m51s)

[And he gifted me a very nice monitor.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m53s)

[See, Andrew. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m55s)

[and I love it. The problem is is it's a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h45m58s)

[very large widescreen one, which doesn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m00s)

[make for good streaming. So, I now have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m03s)

[nice widescreen monitor just off to the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m05s)

[side for me to put all my other stuff,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m07s)

[but I it just doesn't make for good](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m09s)

[streaming stuff. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m11s)

[we stream we stream on this monitor. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m14s)

[my bad. Okay. So, let's let's take a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m16s)

[brief gander at what our spacing looks](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m19s)

[like here. So, because here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m22s)

[what are we looking at?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m25s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m27s)

[let's see. I have a possible challenge](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m30s)

[for you. if it would be of interest](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m32s)

[using .NET, C#, and WPF for UI.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m34s)

[I mean, Izzy, you I am intrigued. Go on.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m38s)

[Okay, so let's see this guy here. I just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m43s)

[want to make sure I understand where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m46s)

[where this is set up. So, this is the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m47s)

[expander control. Those are probably the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m49s)

[same.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m52s)

[And then the items grid is what's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m54s)

[controlling that. So really the question](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h46m58s)

[is from the expander](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m00s)

[and then getting all the way over to the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m04s)

[content. Yeah, content grid. So the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m09s)

[space between here and there.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m11s)

[Let's see.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m14s)

[So, I know what the words mean](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m28s)

[individually.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m30s)

[I'm I'm curious](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m36s)

[because I've never looked into how](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m40s)

[Enigma works. So for people unfamiliar,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m42s)

[Enigma um was the machine used uh during](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m45s)

[World War II and maybe World War I for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m50s)

[um encrypting messages by the Germans](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m54s)

[that I believe it was the scientists in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h47m57s)

[Bletchley Park in Great Britain that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m01s)

[cracked it during World War II, which](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m03s)

[gave them a bit of an edge.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m07s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m10s)

[Let's see. I'm building my own physical](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m13s)

[one, but it would be cool. Oh, so that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m16s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m19s)

[See, and this is the thing like I know](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h48m21s)

[Like I I actually enjoyed um we went up](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h55m52s)

[very different picture than when you're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m20s)

[ballpark.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m31s)

[Yeah, I will say I I feel like a lot of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m34s)

[what I know about European geography and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m36s)

[locations um is dated I don't know about](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m38s)

[six decades](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m44s)

[but you know some of those things are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m46s)

[still fine](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m47s)

[but yeah shoot me times let's and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m51s)

[a team's call and and understand it more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m55s)

[because at a minimum I I would just be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m57s)

[fascinated to learn it and then and then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h56m59s)

[we can talk app or similar and and see](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m02s)

[what that that might look like because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m04s)

[that's always kind of fun too.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m07s)

[Silverstone racetrack](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m10s)

[where the Formula 1 happens. Ah. Ah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m12s)

[Okay. I am aware of that loosely. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m15s)

[should I should clarify my my knowledge](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m18s)

[of various sporting events is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m22s)

[very small.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m25s)

[It is one of the few things that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m28s)

[smaller than my knowledge of say movies](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m29s)

[and actors which is also quite small.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m31s)

[It's one of those like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m35s)

[I will watch something and I'll go that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m37s)

[you know where that actor's from? I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m40s)

[like no should should I have recognized](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m42s)

[them? They're like yeah that's that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m45s)

[kind of a big name. I'm like oh I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m47s)

[probably should pay better attention. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m49s)

[was just I was just watching the story](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m51s)

[anyway. Yeah. So, I don't I don't do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m54s)

[well with actor names or pop culture](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m56s)

[references in general. There's like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h57m58s)

[feel like that's not 100% true. I have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m01s)

[small areas of things where I do know,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m03s)

[but yes, see.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m06s)

[Yeah, it's one of those my I'm starting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m09s)

[to reach the point where I'm feeling](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m11s)

[like my brain has filled up to the point](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m13s)

[where everything that I shove in, I got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m15s)

[to push something else out the back.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m17s)

[like I want to put more in, but I I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m19s)

[don't know that I can retain everything](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m23s)

[I currently have. So, it's like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m24s)

[something's something's got to give. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m27s)

[you know, actor names, movies. Yeah, th](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m28s)

[those those I'm those I'm happy to push](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m31s)

[out the back. Though, I will say I do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m33s)

[tend to also watch a lot of British TV.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m36s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m39s)

[specifically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m41s)

[a lot of like the the panel comedy stuff](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m43s)

[like Taskmaster is absolutely one of my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m45s)

[favorites.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m47s)

[I'm bad at that, too. But I have a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m49s)

[friend who is unreasonably good at it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m51s)

[Yes, there are people like that, Pinku.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m53s)

[And it's frustrating](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m56s)

[because it's it's not like it's not like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h58m58s)

[engineers are dumb. We just prioritize a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m00s)

[different set of knowledge. Like it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m02s)

[just it's a different set of things that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m05s)

[that stick well in my brain. Like I can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m08s)

[my my colleagues sometimes make fun of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m11s)

[me because I will like I can recall APIs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m13s)

[off the top of my head that I that I've](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m17s)

[you know inside of net and and sometimes](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m20s)

[they're a little more obscure and I'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m21s)

[remember like behavioral details of a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m23s)

[particular API's implementation like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m26s)

[months after I've last looked at it and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m28s)

[they're like how do you recall that? I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m30s)

[like I don't know that stuff sticks.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m32s)

[the the name of an actor in a movie I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m35s)

[saw last week that may not ever land at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m38s)

[all.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m40s)

[Yeah, it's it's like my tagging for the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m42s)

[information going in certain things get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m45s)

[the uh the high priority tag. I only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m47s)

[know Bruce Willis and Vin Diesel. See?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m50s)

[And now the problem is if you were to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m54s)

[ask me for a movie they were in,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m55s)

[I would struggle.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=00h59m59s)

[I would struggle. Like even one of my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m01s)

[favorite movies that I watch all like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m04s)

[because I get I think I watch the most](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m06s)

[movies when I'm sick. Um and there's a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m08s)

[handful of movies that I go back to that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m11s)

[I rewatch. Die Hard the Christmas one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m13s)

[Yes. Thank you, Pikachu. You just went](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m16s)

[up a notch by calling Die Hard a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m18s)

[Christmas movie. I'm in that camp again.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m19s)

[That's another one of those things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m21s)

[people need to have a little card on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m22s)

[where they stand on certain issues. Is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m24s)

[Die Hard a Christmas movie? That should](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m26s)

[be a question.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m28s)

[Fast and Furious. See, I feel like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m30s)

[watched because Fast and Furious, didn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m33s)

[they make like eight of those? Because I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m35s)

[feel like I watched like three or four](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m38s)

[and then it started feeling repetitious](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m41s)

[and I never watched any later ones](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m43s)

[cuz that's I'm I'm not getting that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m48s)

[confused, right? Cuz the very first Fast](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m49s)

[and Furious I think I saw it around the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m52s)

[same time I saw like Gone in 60 Seconds.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m55s)

[Now I I realize I don't know that they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h00m58s)

[necessarily came out at the same time. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m00s)

[was saying when I watched them, I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m01s)

[I think I watched both of those within](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m04s)

[like a month of each other. And so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m06s)

[occasionally I get um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m08s)

[which Die Hard was the best. Oh boy,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m12s)

[Izzy. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m14s)

[it's going to be either the first one 10](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m21s)

[now I think. Yeah. So for the which die](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m24s)

[hard is the best? either the first one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m27s)

[or what is what is it? Live free or die](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m29s)

[hard I think is the other is it is that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m32s)

[three or four and I only throw that one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m34s)

[in the mix because it was the first one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m37s)

[I saw and that was my introduction to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m39s)

[the series.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m41s)

[Yeah, first one for me. See see the f](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m45s)

[Yeah, because once I got introduced to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m47s)

[the series, I went back and rewatched](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m49s)

[them in order. Um, and I and I and like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m51s)

[most series, the f like the first](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m55s)

[anything that gets made into a series,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h01m58s)

[my hypothesis is the first one has to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m00s)

[good, otherwise they wouldn't have made](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m03s)

[the subsequent ones, right? Cuz you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m05s)

[get you can get a little bit of grace if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m08s)

[your second one isn't as good as the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m10s)

[first one because you got a little bit](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m11s)

[of hype from the first one going through](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m13s)

[like.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m15s)

[So yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m17s)

[the first three were good, then it just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m20s)

[became copy material. Yeah. Like, and it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m21s)

[felt like there was some nice throwbacks](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m24s)

[on some of the the jokes and references](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m26s)

[in there as well, and then it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m28s)

[yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m32s)

[yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m33s)

[Anyway, plotting and margin.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m36s)

[Flawless transition. Flawless](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m40s)

[transition.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m42s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m44s)

[okay. I was trying to see where the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m46s)

[difference was between that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m50s)

[and whatever the heck this thing is. Why](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m54s)

[aren't you picking it up? What if my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m56s)

[control shift? There we go. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h02m58s)

[this is going to be the fundamental](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m01s)

[problem,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m03s)

[I think.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m05s)

[Because that's a toggle button.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m07s)

[That's an expander with a toggle button.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m10s)

[Yeah. So, this is going to be this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m15s)

[going to be a little bit interesting of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m18s)

[trying to get these two sizes to line up](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m20s)

[because this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m22s)

[I guess expander is itself a toggle](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m25s)

[button 16 by 16](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m27s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m30s)

[uh that's not the right one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m32s)

[Uh that's the hidden one cuz yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m36s)

[you'll note here the subtle difference](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m39s)

[is once we've cuz the this row still has](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m42s)

[the same stuff. It's just being hidden](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m45s)

[and popped through which is just weird](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m46s)

[like but again I played around with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m49s)

[trying to come up with a better](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m52s)

[a better setup for where to to how to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m54s)

[this grid view. And I I think the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h03m59s)

[author's original implementation is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m01s)

[probably the best. I couldn't come up](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m03s)

[with something better. Um, and so we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m06s)

[went with it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m09s)

[Okay. I'm mildly tempted.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m14s)

[Oh, so there's one thing I'm noticing.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m17s)

[This guy is here. So, what I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m21s)

[immediately noticing is that red box is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m24s)

[basically tightly bounded, which means](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m27s)

[the horizontal and vertical alignment](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m29s)

[are probably not stretch.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m31s)

[If I'm if I'm guessing,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m35s)

[oh, vertical alignment is stretch.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m38s)

[Oh, but it's inside of a stack panel,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m44s)

[which is which inherently shrinks.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m46s)

[Yes, because a s a stack panel sizes to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m51s)

[its content. Though it's interesting, or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m54s)

[at least it sizes its content down.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h04m58s)

[I am tempted here. Let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m03s)

[this things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m06s)

[because this guy is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m08s)

[who controls](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m11s)

[because this stack panel has both items](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m13s)

[in it. So, it's got to be controlled by](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m15s)

[padding or margin between the two.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m17s)

[That's the only thing left. I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m21s)

[I have contemplated at some point](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m27s)

[building my own layout control cuz](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m28s)

[there's a handful of things where it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m31s)

[like I just I want them a little bit](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m32s)

[nicer. Like I've actually contemplated](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m34s)

[porting some of the newer like grid APIs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m36s)

[from like Avalonia into WPF because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m39s)

[they're just nicer. They're nicer to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m42s)

[you. They feel more modern and WPF isn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m44s)

[going to well I shouldn't say they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m48s)

[aren't going to.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m50s)

[They don't seem highly motivated to try](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m52s)

[to modernize it in that way with like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m54s)

[new APIs. They seem more f like they've](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h05m58s)

[got a big enough backlog that I can't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m00s)

[imagine it's that high a priority.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m02s)

[Okay. So the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m06s)

[because ultimately the issue is this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m09s)

[indent here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m11s)

[because the the two the two areas that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m15s)

[I'm seeing that are that are smaller is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m17s)

[this distance here is narrower](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m19s)

[right and then the and actually I wonder](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m23s)

[if I just bump if that distance got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m26s)

[larger this B would shift over this guy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m29s)

[would shift over and then we'd have more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m32s)

[space. Maybe that's the kicker is I just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m33s)

[need to make there be enough space](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m36s)

[between those two things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m40s)

[to have them line up. And I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m44s)

[it's probably going to have to be from](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m50s)

[the toggle](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m51s)

[button itself](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m54s)

[because on forward and collapse](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h06m57s)

[Yeah, I think that's probably going to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m04s)

[end up having to be what separates them](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m06s)

[because if we go up here and look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m09s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m11s)

[cuz this is a grid](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m13s)

[and that's offset by 32.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m19s)

[I just got to be careful how I how I do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m25s)

[this. So, how do I measure the distance](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m28s)

[between this and this?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m31s)

[Because there is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m36s)

[that's the margin.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m40s)

[There's no padding.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m44s)

[Let's look at this item. What is this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m49s)

[items grid?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m51s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m53s)

[grid.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m54s)

[Oh. Um, okay. So, while while I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h07m59s)

[thinking about it, so some cool things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m02s)

[in VS 2026 that people should go turn on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m04s)

[immediately. So, the one the new search](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m07s)

[view, which you can get in 2022, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m10s)

[believe, if you turn on the preview](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m13s)

[feature for it. Um but there is this um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m14s)

[this guy here the enable search results](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m20s)

[exclusions](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m24s)

[right how many times have you done a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m26s)

[search and it has landed inside of a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m28s)

[generated file so for example](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m30s)

[hypothetically if we want to exclude](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m33s)

[allg.cs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m36s)

[CS files](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m38s)

[from our search results.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m41s)

[Boom.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m44s)

[This feature made me very very happy.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m47s)

[Very happy. Like gold level happy.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m51s)

[So this this is this is a feature](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h08m55s)

[that and the performance increases I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m00s)

[think are the two biggest reasons to go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m01s)

[through. Um, I will say the other thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m07s)

[Oh, I I closed it, so I probably can't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m09s)

[show it. The](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m11s)

[co-pilot actually has a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m13s)

[So, it says ask an agent here, but it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m17s)

[actually has more modes. Like, there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m20s)

[an extra debug mode where it'll help you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m23s)

[through debugging solutions as well.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m25s)

[like it's got some extra like before](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m28s)

[GitHub copilot in VS was like second](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m32s)

[rate compared to VS Code but now it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m35s)

[got some tricks that it can do because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m38s)

[it has solution knowledge that VS Code](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m41s)

[won't ever get because it doesn't have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m43s)

[that same context to play with. So it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m46s)

[one of those it's it's interesting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m48s)

[because it has access to more things. It](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m50s)

[can do things. Oh, other big thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m52s)

[coming. The um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m55s)

[code coverage, the thing that has been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h09m58s)

[locked behind an enterprise skew for way](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m00s)

[too long](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m03s)

[is coming to all versions.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m05s)

[Hallelujah. like for anybody who missed](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m08s)

[it before um my there is a video and I I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m11s)

[should plug this again](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m16s)

[um because I I got to sit down with Mads](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m18s)

[Christensen who is uh one of the guys on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m23s)

[the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m27s)

[see share copy here's the link here's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m29s)

[the direct link to it um he is one of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m32s)

[the guys on the Visual Studio team and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m35s)

[he was kind enough](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m39s)

[to tolerate my existence and sit down](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m42s)

[with me and chat for an hour.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m45s)

[I realize the video is only 40 minutes](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m49s)

[long. Not all of it was recorded, but um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m50s)

[sit down and do an interview on VS 2026](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m55s)

[like and I'm hoping to be able to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h10m59s)

[more of this as well. So, if anybody is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m01s)

[interested, I I thought this was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m04s)

[awesome, right? And so, huge props to to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m08s)

[Mads for doing it. Um, but if you are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m11s)

[interested in why do you go to 2026,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m14s)

[this is a reason. And there's it feels](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m17s)

[like they are rolling out updates very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m19s)

[rapidly on it as well. So, they like it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m21s)

[feels like every Tuesday there's just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m25s)

[new releases coming. Now, that was kind](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m27s)

[of in line with the same cadence if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m30s)

[you're on the preview builds of VS 2022](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m31s)

[as well. Um, and because 2026 is it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m34s)

[not preview anymore. I'm sorry. It was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m38s)

[renamed. It is insiders. They they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m41s)

[standardized the naming between Visual](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m44s)

[Studio and VS Code so that people didn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m46s)

[have two different sets of terminology.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m48s)

[I just wish they would have made VS Code](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m50s)

[change rather than Visual Studio change](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m52s)

[to match VS Code, but eh, whatever. That](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m53s)

[is not my thing.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h11m58s)

[right.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m01s)

[Um, I was looking at the items grid.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m03s)

[That's what I That was the whole reason](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m05s)

[why we got onto that because I did items](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m06s)

[grid in my search and it didn't come](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m08s)

[Why? I'm not matching on case.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m14s)

[Okay, fine. We'll do this the old](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m19s)

[I want the item.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m28s)

[So, not that one. Not that one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m31s)

[Uh grid view item.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m36s)

[That is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m41s)

[collapse some of that up.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m46s)

[Where is the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m49s)

[Where is that grid at then?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m54s)

[Am I crazy? There was a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h12m58s)

[Okay, I need to I need to poke this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m02s)

[thing through.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m04s)

[Where Where is that grid? Because I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m06s)

[think that's all I want to do is I want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m09s)

[to figure out the appropriate amount of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m10s)

[space to bump this. Bring that in. Put](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m14s)

[that up. Put you off to the side. Sit.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m17s)

[Sit for a second. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m21s)

[there's this toggle button here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m24s)

[And this one's built up in code. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m28s)

[like I'm I'm not surprised that one's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m30s)

[not landing me on anything. But when I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m32s)

[go here, right, this guy here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m34s)

[tree list view item](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m41s)

[item grid. It's got a name on it. Oh, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m44s)

[put items, didn't I? I did. I'm an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m47s)

[idiot.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m51s)

[Pro tip. If you don't spell the name of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m53s)

[the grid properly, it won't show up in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m55s)

[your search results.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m57s)

[See, that's what I need AI for is to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h13m59s)

[tell me when I have not spelled the name](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m01s)

[of the thing that I wanted to search](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m03s)

[for. That is what that is what it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m05s)

[purpose. Okay. So, there's the grid](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m08s)

[and this is what I was looking for. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m12s)

[it's got a fancy. So, the grid has a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m13s)

[margin for its left side to be able to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m15s)

[push it over. Great, fine, whatever.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m17s)

[Right, that makes sense. But I'm looking](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m20s)

[for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m22s)

[the size between the columns because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m23s)

[there's your expander and our two](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m26s)

[expanders are the same size.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m29s)

[And I don't care about the mouse over or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m32s)

[the selection border. Those are just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m34s)

[visual state stuff.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m36s)

[So, this grid just goes into the first.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m40s)

[So these two columns should be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m42s)

[cuz they're autosized, right? Column](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m46s)

[one,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m48s)

[call span 2, but its left side is still](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m50s)

[going to be column one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m53s)

[So why?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h14m57s)

[So how does that get that much spacing?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m03s)

[Is there an extra](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m09s)

[Where where is that much space? So what](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m18s)

[I'm looking for is where the spacing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m20s)

[comes from. Right. Right. Like big gap,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m24s)

[little gap. But this guy here is built](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m30s)

[in code. So I don't expect to find the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m33s)

[ZAML because that's the the control](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m36s)

[template bit. But what I want to figure](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m37s)

[out is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m39s)

[how that gap is so big like what what is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m41s)

[different about](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m46s)

[right like that thing is still I I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m51s)

[oh there is a small difference. I just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m56s)

[noticed that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h15m59s)

[by putting it inside the content](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m02s)

[it has subtly picked up](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m07s)

[and there's actually this left margin](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m12s)

[here that the other one doesn't have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m14s)

[because it's already indented. Oh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m17s)

[interesting. Interesting. Okay. Okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m20s)

[because it's inside this content grid.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m26s)

[This guy here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m33s)

[his content grid is offset.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m35s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m39s)

[That's a minor thing in my opinion.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m40s)

[But how like this guy is 16 by 16 in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m45s)

[grid whose column auto sizes](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m51s)

[which means it's containing column](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m55s)

[should be I guess we could just look the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h16m57s)

[column should just be 16 right column](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m00s)

[definitions](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m03s)

[actual width is 32](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m07s)

[where did you pick up the extra 16](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m11s)

[pixels](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m14s)

[Because the thing in here is only 16.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m16s)

[Does this have a margin?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m18s)

[There it is. So, this expander has a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m25s)

[margin](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m28s)

[of 88.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m32s)

[I am tempted. Then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m37s)

[this guy's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m41s)

[um toggle button](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m46s)

[also has a margin of 88.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m49s)

[Sorry, I'm looking right here in case](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m52s)

[that's not obvious.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m53s)

[Where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h17m55s)

[stack panel.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m11s)

[Interesting.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m13s)

[Let's see. Uh Hen in WPF I've created a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m15s)

[numbers only textbox using uh linked](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m18s)

[approach. Is this implementation better](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m21s)

[than other common solutions? Let's take](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m23s)

[a look.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m25s)

[Let's take a look because I I think the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m26s)

[the generalized term that I would assume](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m29s)

[is some people will call this like a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m31s)

[mast text box. Um that name I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m33s)

[leeches over from Windows forms. Uh so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m36s)

[let's see here. So we've got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m39s)

[uh class that derives from textbox. Uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m43s)

[let's see. We changed the property](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m46s)

[metadata for the text property so that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m49s)

[we can tack in a property changed](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m51s)

[handler. It looks like original text](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m54s)

[property change call back. So we do have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h18m56s)

[that there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m00s)

[and then coers customize text and so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m02s)

[it's watching the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m07s)

[the inserts and then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m09s)

[we tweaking the coerced value all the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m14s)

[way through.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m18s)

[My my only question on this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m23s)

[does this work on a textbox](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m28s)

[that isn't data bound](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m33s)

[trying to remember the order of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m37s)

[operations on on when coerc gets called](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m38s)

[as part of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m41s)

[it's probably okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m43s)

[Um, so to to answer your question, um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m48s)

[there's there's not necessarily a an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m53s)

[issue here. Most common solutions,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h19m56s)

[um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m00s)

[well, I should say one of the more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m02s)

[common solutions is to hijack it earlier](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m04s)

[in the process rather than grabbing it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m07s)

[as part of the text change. I see a lot](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m10s)

[of people do it with like key press or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m12s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m14s)

[um which doesn't work perfectly when you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m16s)

[do it on key press because you could](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m19s)

[imagine the mouse rightclick paste um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m21s)

[often times then doesn't trigger and so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m24s)

[you'll often see things where it does a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m26s)

[lot of implementations do something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m29s)

[similar where they grab it here and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m30s)

[force the the masked value. I think this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m33s)

[works. My only thought though is on the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m38s)

[cose](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m41s)

[I would test it in both uh a case where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m44s)

[you've bound it and where you haven't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m47s)

[bound it to a view model property. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m49s)

[oh that's that's the only thing in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m54s)

[there. Um because I I this takes care of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m55s)

[all the edge cases. Yeah it no. So to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h20m59s)

[answer your question this is perfectly](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m02s)

[fine. Um especially for something that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m03s)

[like numeric only. I think this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m06s)

[usually fairly simple. Most people who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m09s)

[take on doing a mass text box, they they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m11s)

[oftentimes they're doing it because they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m13s)

[want to do things like say enter a phone](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m15s)

[number and so they want it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m17s)

[quote unquote better than just a regular](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m23s)

[than just limiting to a particular](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m25s)

[character set. They want more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m26s)

[customizability. And that's where things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m28s)

[start to get wacky, right? Because if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m30s)

[you look at like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m35s)

[because I think MA apps does this and I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m37s)

[I think there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m39s)

[I think their implementation shows off](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m42s)

[how incredibly complicated this gets](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m44s)

[very quickly to do it well. Like I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m47s)

[yours will work just fine. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m49s)

[uh where is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h21m54s)

[it? Mask text box.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m03s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m07s)

[why it's not finding it? I wonder if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m21s)

[they buried it into an attached](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m23s)

[property.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m26s)

[I might I might have to look around for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m28s)

[it, but we can go here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m31s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m35s)

[do they show it here?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m36s)

[Interesting. They don't show it here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m42s)

[Did they get rid of it? I thought they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m45s)

[had it at one point. Maybe I'm crazy.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m47s)

[Um, yeah. Uh, I don't necessarily see a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m51s)

[problem with this.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m54s)

[Like, some people might scoff at the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m57s)

[fact that it's a string copy, but you're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h22m58s)

[going to end up with that anyway.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m01s)

[um you might want to handle](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m04s)

[uh the value coming through. You you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m10s)

[might also want an extra if case. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m12s)

[there's a static property on dependency](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m15s)

[object called unset value. Um you will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m17s)

[sometimes run into that in data binding](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m20s)

[cases when a control is being first](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m23s)

[loaded or unloaded. So you might want in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m26s)

[addition to checking for no null, you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m29s)

[might want to check if value is uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m31s)

[dependency object.unset value as well](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m34s)

[because that will occasionally creep up.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m39s)

[You may](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m47s)

[Yeah, this is more specifically an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m50s)

[integer text box. Yeah. Yeah. No, and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m51s)

[that's a fair call out. And I I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m55s)

[that's the thing that I was mentioning](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m57s)

[where most of the time when people](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h23m58s)

[create a full mass text box, it gets](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m00s)

[more complicated because you immediately](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m03s)

[run into cases where that's exactly what](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m06s)

[people want, right? They want, you know,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m08s)

[their digit separators. they want to do.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m11s)

[Well, what if I want to type in commas](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m13s)

[or, you know, maybe I want it to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m16s)

[local specific and so, you know, I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m18s)

[doing French where the the decimal](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m20s)

[separator is a comma rather than here in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m23s)

[America where it's, you know, a thousand](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m25s)

[separator. So, it's just it things get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m27s)

[big and confusing quick. But yeah, no, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m30s)

[think that's a perfectly fine](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m32s)

[I think that is perfectly fine.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m37s)

[Um I am](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m43s)

[so this indents](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h24m53s)

[Interesting. Interesting. Interesting.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m02s)

[Okay. But is there a better I just don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m04s)

[know if there's a better way to do it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m08s)

[I don't know if there's a better way to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m12s)

[do it. So, I think what's going to end](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m13s)

[up needing to happen is this content](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m16s)

[presenter is probably going to need a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m18s)

[margin added to it. And I think it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m20s)

[going to need to be left of 16 if I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m22s)

[guessing.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m25s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m29s)

[that looks way too big.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m31s)

[must](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m34s)

[that looks a lot more akin to what I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m39s)

[would expect.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m41s)

[So I think that might be it. If we just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m45s)

[add a left margin on that content](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m47s)

[presenter of eight. Let's go look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h25m50s)

[I think you can just do it right here if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h26m46s)

[I think that's all I need. Let's let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m02s)

[test that. And if that's the case, I'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m05s)

[push this up. We'll take a brief gander](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m07s)

[at that failing UI test and then we'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m10s)

[see about merging this sucker in because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m12s)

[this one has been outstanding for a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m15s)

[while](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m16s)

[and then at some point I want to go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m23s)

[through and actually get the release out](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m25s)

[months. I need to just do it. I need to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m28s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m31s)

[there. Those look](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m34s)

[very close.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m38s)

[if I draw a straight line down on the X,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m49s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m53s)

[If I can get my mouse to hold still. Oh,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m55s)

[I'm not a gamer. There we go. All right.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h27m58s)

[let's go here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m23s)

[that case I was using zoom it to do it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m38s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m41s)

[and shift does start the line tool but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m42s)

[it doesn't enforce a straight line.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m45s)

[notepad document.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h28m59s)

[I have a strange suspicion that given](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m01s)

[that the test in question](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m04s)

[had nothing to do with the changes that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m07s)

[were made](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m09s)

[and that this is a sporadically failing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m12s)

[test. And so that doesn't instill me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m13s)

[with confidence. It makes me why why are](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m17s)

[you like that? Go there. Um, so we're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m20s)

[going to run this test really quick and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m25s)

[I'm going to briefly take a look at](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m27s)

[I hope that I didn't just break it by](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m33s)

[jiggling my mouse on it. Nope. Passed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m34s)

[Okay, so it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m37s)

[I want to look at what line failed. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m40s)

[have a sinking suspicion](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m42s)

[that's my bug](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m45s)

[hypothetically.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m49s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m50s)

[but I want to check the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m52s)

[pipeline logs on it real quick. And then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m56s)

[also grab the because if I go summary,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h29m59s)

[come on. Give me the summary.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m04s)

[Stop being helpful. Let me collapse you.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m10s)

[Um, and then I grab my screenshots.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m13s)

[open](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m18s)

[and we look](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m20s)

[can see the screenshot at the point the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m23s)

[test failed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m25s)

[So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m29s)

[what I can tell immediately](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m31s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m35s)

[the because I see the ripple I I have a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m37s)

[pretty good idea of where the cursor is.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m40s)

[the popup content was in fact displayed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m44s)

[So given that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m48s)

[and the failure was expected invocation](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m52s)

[to have count of one but was zero](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m56s)

[instead.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h30m58s)

[So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m00s)

[this guy here failed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m03s)

[I think what we want to do is await](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m11s)

[wait for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m16s)

[because the way the uh maybe a spin wave](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m19s)

[rather than a test delay. Yeah, that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m23s)

[effectively what my wait for does is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m24s)

[it'll just it'll keep retrying.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m27s)

[Um I have to be mildly careful because I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m30s)

[have two overloads on here. One is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m32s)

[boolean and one is not. And so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m35s)

[occasionally I have shot myself in the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m38s)

[foot by](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m40s)

[not remembering that that is how past](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m42s)

[Kevin did things and he was an idiot. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m45s)

[but this one here will spin weighting](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m51s)

[for a single invocation.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m55s)

[And actually, we can probably get rid of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h31m58s)

[the task delay now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m00s)

[because this guy here um has a it's a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m03s)

[poor man's retry, but he will attempt](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m07s)

[retry. And I I think the default retry](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m10s)

[is like five times over two seconds or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m12s)

[something like that. Um but you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m15s)

[obviously pass in different ones if you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m18s)

[want. Um yeah, because retrydefault I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m20s)

[don't remember what retry.default is set](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m23s)

[to. Yeah. So it'll do five times over 2](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m25s)

[seconds. So much better than 50](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m28s)

[milliseconds and then hopefully will be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m32s)

[less problematic.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m34s)

[So that's that's probably better. Okay,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m36s)

[Kraken, help me. Stage changes. What do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m39s)

[you think of that commit?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m43s)

[Yeah, sure. Good enough.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m48s)

[Okay. And then we're going to I do not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m51s)

[know if I have push permission to this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m53s)

[remote, so we're going to find out.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m54s)

[We do. We got push permission, baby.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h32m58s)

[Thank you.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m04s)

[And then we've got automerge. This](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m06s)

[should fire off again. And we'll let](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m09s)

[this guy go in. Right. So, the only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m11s)

[check that's missing should be the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m13s)

[build pipeline,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m17s)

[which should be firing shortly. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m19s)

[Why? Why you no fire?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m27s)

[Where did that push to?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m37s)

[Because this also doesn't show.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m41s)

[This still says four files changed and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m46s)

[we just changed the test.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m48s)

[That's not right.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m50s)

[Uh, let's see. Set upstream.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m54s)

[Oh, it didn't go to his](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h33m58s)

[uh, okay, hold on. It set it. Okay, it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m02s)

[went to origin. Dang it. I didn't look](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m06s)

[at where I was pushing to. Bad me. Bad](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m08s)

[me. Um, do you give me a nice delete](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m11s)

[option?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m14s)

[Delete.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m16s)

[So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m21s)

[I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m23s)

[So I don't want to go origin,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m25s)

[right? I just want before I start](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m29s)

[deleting remote branches, I just want to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m30s)

[be real confident. Okay, origin is mine.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m32s)

[Muhammad Hadti 2031](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m40s)

[is the real one.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m43s)

[So, let's change upstream](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m45s)

[to there.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m50s)

[Huh? Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m52s)

[this is bad. This is bad.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h34m56s)

[Um, I want not being able to see](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m02s)

[not being able to see the full text does](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m08s)

[not instill me with confidence. I will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m10s)

[be filing a bug report. Okay, because I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m12s)

[would love to be able to see all of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m16s)

[that. But with that said, it's the only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m17s)

[one in my list of remotes, so I'm very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m20s)

[confident. Now we push.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m22s)

[Okay, push successful. So now we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m27s)

[rightclick, we come down here, and we do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m29s)

[delete origin. Delete.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m32s)

[There we go. So now the only two icons](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m36s)

[that I see up here is the original](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m38s)

[author's logo and my local. So now the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m39s)

[PR should be running.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m44s)

[There we go. Shows changes. Six files](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m47s)

[changed. Great, great, great, great,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m49s)

[great, great, great, great. Uh, split](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m52s)

[button test. Oh, dang it. Did I change](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m55s)

[this on a different branch?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h35m57s)

[Crap.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m01s)

[Rebase.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m05s)

[Rebase.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m08s)

[There are merge conflicts. Of course](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m13s)

[there are. Okay, you guys ready for the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m15s)

[best button ever? You ready?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m17s)

[Auto resolve with AI.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m23s)

[I love this button. I absolutely love](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m26s)

[this button. Like the only negative](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m29s)

[thing I can say about it is it's a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m32s)

[little slow, but it is usually spot on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m34s)

[the mark for figuring out how because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m38s)

[you'll note the correct merge in this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m41s)

[case sometimes requires neither left nor](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m43s)

[right and like a combination of the two.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m47s)

[And it is shockingly good at hitting the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m50s)

[mark. Shockingly good. I love this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m52s)

[thing. Okay, so this left in the task](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m55s)

[delay. I guess we can put it back. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h36m58s)

[let's see here. And this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m01s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m10s)

[I'm just checking. So, in both cases,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m12s)

[this one just got renamed for the for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m17s)

[the switch to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m20s)

[um TUnit from XUnit. And so it caught](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m23s)

[that neutral from that side](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m27s)

[but put it inside the await. That's why](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m30s)

[it shows a so the move myself out of the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m33s)

[way. The reason it shows a me make it a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m36s)

[little bigger. A black bar here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m39s)

[is because it didn't actually take the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m44s)

[line from up here. Even though it's the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m47s)

[same text, it's indented. So So it is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m50s)

[technically an edited line. So, it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m53s)

[noticed that it needed to to indent that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m56s)

[well enough.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h37m58s)

[And yeah, thank you.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m01s)

[Like, hands down, if you need a reason](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m05s)

[to use Get Kraken, that button right](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m08s)

[there, auto resolve with AI.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m11s)

[Best thing since sliced bread.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m15s)

[Absolutely love that feature. like that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m18s)

[is that is one of the coolest AI](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m21s)

[features. So I'll show this recompose](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m24s)

[commits with AI as well because this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m26s)

[this one is kind of interesting. Um so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m29s)

[if I hit recompose with AI and it may](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m32s)

[it'll probably be okay. So the recompose](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m35s)

[with AI does have an issue where if you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m37s)

[give it too much data, it just can't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m41s)

[handle it and it throws Nare at you. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m43s)

[unfortunately, it's not slicing its data](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m47s)

[up intelligently. It's just sending it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m50s)

[And so you can very easily blow it its](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m53s)

[context out. So um hopefully that gets](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m56s)

[resolved or or worked around or similar](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h38m59s)

[in the in the future. But](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m01s)

[we'll give this guy a minute to think.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m06s)

[So you saw what I did there where I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m09s)

[immediately rebased when I ran into the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m11s)

[conflict because I am in the rebase, not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m14s)

[the merge camp. So the autocompose with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m15s)

[AI, what this ends up doing is it's uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m19s)

[if you imagine you've been doing work on](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m23s)

[a branch and you've just been making](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m24s)

[lots of commits, it will go through all](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m26s)

[of those changes, logically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m28s)

[group them, and rebuild different](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m32s)

[commits. And you'll note by default it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m34s)

[does the what is the term? Is it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m36s)

[standard commit message? Standardized](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m38s)

[commit message. I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m40s)

[the right the the right term for it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m42s)

[where it starts to build these things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m43s)

[out and it it separates your changes](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m46s)

[into logical ones to make you look smart](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m49s)

[effectively. Uh can recompose with AI](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m53s)

[use uh local AI model? Yes.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m55s)

[Um and I'm going to put a small asterisk](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h39m59s)

[next to that. You do need to have a skew](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m02s)

[that lets you have this checkbox](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m05s)

[underneath the Git Kraken AI and then](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m07s)

[you can point it at a custom URL and you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m10s)

[can use like Olama locally, you can use](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m12s)

[like Azure AI foundry locally. Um, yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m15s)

[Use on offline systems. Yeah. So, as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m19s)

[long as your Git Kraken has an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m21s)

[appropriate skew, and I don't remember](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m23s)

[what skew has this checkbox. So, like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m25s)

[it's not in the free one, and I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m29s)

[remember what tier tier gets it. Um, but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m32s)

[as long as you've got this checkbox, you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m34s)

[can point it at a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m36s)

[um a local like their sample here is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m39s)

[even local host, right? So, you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m41s)

[point it at whatever you would like and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m43s)

[then you're off to the races, right? So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m46s)

[you can use your local model. it never](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m47s)

[has to leave your your system at all. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m49s)

[there isn't a way to se like in get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m53s)

[kraken like all the AI goes to your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m56s)

[configurated system. There's not like a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h40m59s)

[way to separate out the different AI](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m00s)

[calls into different systems. It all](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m02s)

[just goes to the one um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m04s)

[yes absolutely Izzy. Yes. And again](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m08s)

[there there is this checkbox is behind a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m11s)

[a particular skew of Git Kraken and I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m15s)

[don't remember what skew it gets added](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m18s)

[in at. So I would small asterisk there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m20s)

[that it like possible yes with an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m23s)

[appropriate license but yeah but yes you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m26s)

[can you can run it totally local off to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m29s)

[the races and have fun. But the coolest](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m32s)

[thing about the recompose commits is now](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m34s)

[that it's regrouped them, it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m36s)

[automatically opens you into the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m38s)

[interactive commit window, which they](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m39s)

[already had, where you can do things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m41s)

[like this. You can just reorder your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m43s)

[commits however you'd like. If you want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m46s)

[to, you can squash a couple of them](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m48s)

[together,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m50s)

[which is pretty slick, right? Like this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m52s)

[get like, oh, well, I want this one to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m54s)

[be part of that. Oh, you know, let's go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h41m57s)

[ahead and put this one as the a pick.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m00s)

[and well maybe we actually don't want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m02s)

[this change because you know it grouped](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m04s)

[you know some debugging lines together](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m06s)

[as a logical change that I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m08s)

[actually want to include. So you get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m11s)

[this whole interactive rebase but what](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m12s)

[it's done because it's redone all of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m15s)

[your commits. This is functionally like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m18s)

[a really it's a smarter rebase because a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m20s)

[rebase just replays your original](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m23s)

[commits. This is replaying a new set of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m25s)

[commits that have been logically](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m28s)

[grouped, which is awesome, right? So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m30s)

[after you do this, you do have to force](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m33s)

[push just like any other rebase, but you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m35s)

[do have all of these awesome things. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m38s)

[if when you forget the uh the shortcuts,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m40s)

[they're right there at the bottom,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m42s)

[right? So, you can, you know, control](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m45s)

[up, down, move stuff around as as you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m47s)

[see fit, right? Which is which is just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m49s)

[awesome. Absolut like this. This it took](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m53s)

[me a while to realize how cool this was.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h42m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m00s)

[yeah. Note to contact get cracking](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m04s)

[people for business use.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m06s)

[Yeah. Yeah. No, absolutely. And Izzy, if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m09s)

[you have any if you have any issues or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m12s)

[need a contact there, let me know. um as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m13s)

[one of their ambassadors, if if you need](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m16s)

[somebody to get somebody connected, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m19s)

[can make appropriate introductions for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m22s)

[you. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m24s)

[but yeah, so and they do have the little](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m27s)

[thumbs up, thumbs down here because this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m29s)

[is like AI of hey, was this helpful?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m31s)

[because sometimes like my biggest](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m33s)

[can put custom stuff in here. My my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m52s)

[biggest complaint is I feel like it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m54s)

[makes the commits too small at times](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m56s)

[rather than grouping. Like I find myself](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h43m59s)

[going, "No, no, these two actually go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m02s)

[together. No, no, these two." Like I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m05s)

[find myself doing that more than going](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m08s)

[the other way. Like, so by default, I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m10s)

[feel like sometimes it doesn't group](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m13s)

[things the way I want it to, but it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m15s)

[still really nice to have it group](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m17s)

[together, which again, this is an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m19s)

[awesome feature. Like, love the like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m23s)

[this. Again, when I saw it, I was very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m26s)

[confused at first because I I didn't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m28s)

[fully understand. Oh, not explain commit](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m30s)

[uh but the the recompose commits. And](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m33s)

[you can do it with your your work in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m35s)

[progress. It doesn't have to be an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m37s)

[already made commit. Like it'll because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m39s)

[it's re it's basically taking all of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m41s)

[your commits and then breaking them](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m44s)

[apart into logical groups, which is so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m45s)

[cool. So cool. So yeah, so that is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m48s)

[commit composer. Um, and I really want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m53s)

[and you know it's got explain commits](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m55s)

[down here so you can feed it in here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m57s)

[And I would not be shocked to find that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h44m59s)

[recompose leverages the explain to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m01s)

[figure out how to do like I don't know](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m04s)

[what their back end is doing on it but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m06s)

[it would not shock me to find that those](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m08s)

[two things are are somewhat similar. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m10s)

[that's been like I have been very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m12s)

[impressed with their approach to AI](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m15s)

[because it's been like they've tried to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m16s)

[use AI to actually solve the problems I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m19s)

[care about rather than just giving me](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m21s)

[another chatbot. Right? Like the explain](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m25s)

[commit it was nice](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m27s)

[but this is nicer like this is this is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m30s)

[this is that extra extra sauce. So we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m33s)

[like the extra sauce. Okay. So, that guy](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m37s)

[approved workflows to run.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m41s)

[Okay, so that guy should be off and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m44s)

[running now. Let's go take a look and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m46s)

[see because I think there was a couple](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m47s)

[other PRs out here because unfortunately](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m49s)

[people have been doing like lots of good](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m51s)

[PR stuff. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m53s)

[let's take a look at Corvin stuff. Why](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m56s)

[does Corvin stuff have failing tests?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h45m58s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m02s)

[let's see. This fix is basically the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m05s)

[state change event of the parent window](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m08s)

[which I think this is what I was looking](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m10s)

[at right before I went offline](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m11s)

[cuz I is is this the same issue?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m15s)

[This might be the same issue](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m20s)

[and I think we can kill the evaluation](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m23s)

[required at this point. I think it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m25s)

[confirmed that like if it's in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m26s)

[milestone that's what I need. I need a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m28s)

[little bit I want a GitHub action. So if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m30s)

[anybody wants to submit a PR for this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m33s)

[I'd love it. um that watches for when a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m34s)

[milestone is added to an issue and rem](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m38s)

[and removes the event. Well, do I want](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m41s)

[that?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m44s)

[Cuz it's like I I think I think I do. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m49s)

[think I want the the evaluation needed](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m53s)

[or evaluation required to drop off of an](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h46m57s)

[issue when it's added to a milestone or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m00s)

[when a PR is open and linked to it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m03s)

[because in both of those cases it's it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m06s)

[really not like the evaluation needed is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m09s)

[only there because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m12s)

[I have trouble keeping up with the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m14s)

[close things after a while which is not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m20s)

[a great experience. experience, but it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m22s)

[the only way I can save myself on tons](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m24s)

[of Croft and try to prioritize things.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m26s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m30s)

[let's see. If the window is restored](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m32s)

[from the minimized state, we focus the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m33s)

[previously focused elements that got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m35s)

[stored in the field when the window got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m37s)

[minimized. I want to point out this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m38s)

[artificial delay I added that we have in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m40s)

[other places in the dialogue host 2.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m43s)

[Yep, I couldn't get it to work without](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m44s)

[the 50 millisecond delay as described my](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m46s)

[comment with the hacky code. s. And in a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m48s)

[lot of cases, this 50 millisecond delay](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m51s)

[is roughly what the built-in popup](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m54s)

[controls animation needs. I I do not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h47m57s)

[have a good explanation. It existed in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m01s)

[this control before I took over the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m04s)

[library and it has been like this is one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m06s)

[of those controls that I think is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m12s)

[amazing but I've often thought about how](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m13s)

[I might do it differently because it has](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m16s)

[all the functionality I want but the API](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m20s)

[of this thing has confused more people](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m22s)

[than any other control in the library.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m24s)

[Okay, so listen for window changes. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m28s)

[where what what is this inside of?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m30s)

[So, okay. So, we're inside of the show.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m34s)

[No, we aren't. We don't know where we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m37s)

[are. Where are we?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m40s)

[I think we're inside of show.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m45s)

[No, we're in the onopen property change](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m49s)

[call back. Okay. So, on open](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m51s)

[is open is false. So we get into our](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m56s)

[else case,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h48m59s)

[come through here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m02s)

[Session ended, blah blah blah. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m08s)

[we're getting a new session. We're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m10s)

[starting this up. We've grabbed the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m12s)

[parent window.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m14s)

[I do wonder if this should be inside](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m19s)

[this if if dialog host restore focus](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m21s)

[disabled.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m23s)

[Yeah. I wonder if this should actually](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m28s)

[cuz what how are you because we've got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m38s)

[last focus dialogue element previous](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m40s)

[window state. Okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m43s)

[So listen for window changes. So we're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m48s)

[listening for the changes, but where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m50s)

[have we stored the element](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m52s)

[task delay continue with begin invoke](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h49m57s)

[with a lower priority invert query. Yes.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m02s)

[So this isn't a change to anything. What](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m09s)

[is this? A whites space change. I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m12s)

[get why this is showing up in the diff.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m14s)

[Oh, the curly brace moved down from the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m17s)

[end of the line. Okay,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m19s)

[listen for window state changed.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m25s)

[Okay, and this is this is good here. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m28s)

[for people unfamiliar with this pattern,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m31s)

[this is something that you end up doing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m33s)

[a lot in C um with events because events](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m35s)

[when you do a plus equals like this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m40s)

[because the event handler is an instance](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m42s)

[method, the event is holding on to both](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m45s)

[a reference to the this instance which](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m50s)

[in this case this is a dialogue host](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m52s)

[instance. So the window object has a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m54s)

[reference to the dialogue host object](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h50m58s)

[and by unregistering first this is a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m01s)

[noop if it hasn't been registered or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m04s)

[it'll remove it if it is registered. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m08s)

[this guarantees that there's only one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m10s)

[registration done.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m12s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m15s)

[And so we watch for the state changes.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m17s)

[This if is okay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m20s)

[We could probably hard cast. I don't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m25s)

[know if it really matters like when](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m27s)

[you're it's a private handler.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m29s)

[Some if somebody registers up a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m32s)

[different event handler and it's not to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m34s)

[the window, they probably deserve a cast](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m36s)

[exception, but whatever. It's not a big](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m38s)

[deal. So, we're watching for the window](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m41s)

[state changes. And then we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m44s)

[when we go to minimized](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m47s)

[we grab the focused element. Now I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m53s)

[noticing this is get focused element of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m56s)

[the using the window as the root. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h51m58s)

[this may not be inside the dialogue](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m00s)

[host.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m04s)

[This is this I wonder if this should be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m06s)

[this rather than window here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m09s)

[Like in theory, your focus shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m13s)

[able to be somewhere other than the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m16s)

[dialogue host, but the dialogue host](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m18s)

[doesn't necessarily have to cover up all](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m20s)

[the content of your window. Like that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m23s)

[typically how it's used. But even in the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m25s)

[demo app, we've got some examples where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m27s)

[well, but it does that matter.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m30s)

[I'm just wondering if the dialog should](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m38s)

[capture and handle that or not.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m40s)

[like this. I I wonder if there should be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m43s)

[an extra check here on if dialogue host](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m45s)

[well is opened is not actually a good](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m47s)

[check either because again the focus](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m49s)

[could be on an element that is outside](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m51s)

[of the dialogue host itself. It may not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m53s)

[be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m56s)

[part of it.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h52m58s)

[Okay. Is window restore from minimized?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m00s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m04s)

[Yeah, very important to check because it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m13s)

[could have changed](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m15s)

[like it could be data bound to something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m17s)

[that's for all I know on a timer and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m19s)

[these are both fine.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m32s)

[It's just that call that gives me pause.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m37s)

[It's that call that gives me pause. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m41s)

[I want to look this up because I I do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m44s)

[wonder if we want to.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h53m46s)

[I also wonder if this guy should be set](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m08s)

[to null](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m10s)

[I do.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m47s)

[Yeah, because it's using window as the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m51s)

[focus scope and I wonder if what we](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m53s)

[should actually do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h54m56s)

[H.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m03s)

[I'm gonna think out loud.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m08s)

[So I'm I'm in WPF they have these](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m10s)

[concept things of of focus scopes,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m13s)

[right? You can imagine like when you're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m16s)

[tabbing through a control like you can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m17s)

[imagine a form with like a group box](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m21s)

[where maybe your tabbing sends you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m23s)

[through the elements of the group box](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m25s)

[but doesn't jump you out of it. That is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m26s)

[a a scope that is possible, right? A](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m28s)

[window is always a focus scope because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m31s)

[you can tab through all of the elements](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m34s)

[of the window and when you reach the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m35s)

[last element, you go back to the first](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m37s)

[somewhere else, right?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m40s)

[Um I am wondering if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m45s)

[because we could make I think popup is a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m50s)

[focus scope by default.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m53s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h55m58s)

[I'm going to put a question here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h56m01s)

[That's probably true. Uh let's see. This](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m31s)

[fixes a runtime binding error.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m34s)

[Yeah, relative source find ancestor is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m39s)

[problematic especially in cases where](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m42s)

[the control might be cycling like in um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m44s)

[a list box or similar. The exact same](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m47s)

[binding I fixed in this PR is also used](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m50s)

[does not throw the binding error. I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m55s)

[honestly not sure why. Okay. Well, let's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h57m56s)

[let's take a look.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m00s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m06s)

[this is inside of the expander.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m08s)

[doesn't.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m29s)

[So, the only thing that I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m34s)

[that's different between them is one has](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m37s)

[a transform group and the other doesn't.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m39s)

[above it has an Xname set, which means](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m46s)

[somebody's doing something funky with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m49s)

[this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m51s)

[to to reference it by name. It could be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=01h58m52s)

[so this guy here,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h00m56s)

[let's start with this. Who is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m03s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m08s)

[And this is what I was wondering about](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m13s)

[is it's going it's it's assuming that it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m14s)

[can target that and do a scale transform](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m16s)

[on the target property.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m19s)

[Why do you even have a name?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h01m55s)

[You do have a purpose.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h02m16s)

[though.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h02m45s)

[If I do this,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h02m47s)

[reason I'm doing the control F is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h02m52s)

[know where the hits are.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h02m59s)

[Right. So I'm I'm literally just using](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h03m02s)

[those as kind of a quick scroll up and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h03m04s)

[down to know where I'm at. So it's only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h03m06s)

[So that's only there for the opacity.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h03m10s)

[I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h03m35s)

[second element is getting hidden with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m25s)

[PD](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m31s)

[uh set to zero.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m33s)

[Okay. So, we'll do that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m42s)

[and then that guy is approved. We'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m46s)

[enable automerge. Enable automerge.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m48s)

[Put it in the milestone. We'll put him](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m51s)

[in the milestone.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m54s)

[Then that'll close. Okay. So, let's go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h06m58s)

[take a look at you cuz you are like all](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m02s)

[of these failing tests. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m05s)

[Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m08s)

[so once again, I'm willing to bet if I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m19s)

[run this in isolation, it works. But let](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m21s)

[me go back to the right branch before I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m24s)

[get too carried away.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m27s)

[And we are going to get this guy to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m29s)

[pass.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m31s)

[I am noticing there there is a click and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m33s)

[a leftclick delay.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m35s)

[And so I'm wondering if I just need to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m41s)

[wrap this sucker up in an in a weight as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m42s)

[well. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m45s)

[let me grab the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m48s)

[screenshots](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m51s)

[and just confirm that that looks to be](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m53s)

[the case.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h07m56s)

[8 961.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m01s)

[Giveimme, gimme, gimme,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m04s)

[gimme.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m07s)

[So things that I'm noticing here, the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m12s)

[ripple effect is still animating](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m16s)

[because you can see the thicker bar](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m20s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m22s)

[So, either the click missed the target,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m24s)

[which seems unlikely,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m28s)

[or the animation is not long enough. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m31s)

[wait, wait. Or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m38s)

[I think we're just going to do this.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m41s)

[And actually, what we might do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m45s)

[We might allow for some amount of delay](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m55s)

[here. So, let's do this. What are you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h08m58s)

[unhappy about? Oh, because you need to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m03s)

[be a sync](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m05s)

[to hit the right overload.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m08s)

[I'm thinking what I'm going to do is I'm](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m11s)

[going to bring](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m13s)

[both of you down.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m15s)

[That way in the event of a failure, it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m19s)

[redo the click.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m22s)

[And then we're going to do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m24s)

[assert. And actually, maybe what we'll](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m28s)

[do is we'll move act down here and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m29s)

[assert here.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m32s)

[UI tests get a little weird because you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m36s)

[start to violate some of the basic](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m38s)

[premises of unit tests.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m40s)

[like normally so there there's an idea](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m44s)

[with unit testing that you should only](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m46s)

[test one thing at a time inside of your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m48s)

[test and I usually will tell people that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m51s)

[means one logical thing right that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m53s)

[doesn't necessarily mean a single](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m56s)

[assertion but you should test because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h09m57s)

[sometimes testing one thing might](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m00s)

[require multiple assertions that's fine](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m02s)

[but you shouldn't have a test doing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m04s)

[multiple things which is often why I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m06s)

[push for good naming of the test because](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m08s)

[if it's hard to figure out the one thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m10s)

[that your test is testing it's usually](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m12s)

[really hard to write the name.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m14s)

[But when you get into things like UI](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m16s)

[testing, the amount of time it takes to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m18s)

[set up and then the number of steps that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m21s)

[you need to go through and maybe](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m23s)

[validate at each incremental thing,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m24s)

[you're it's more like a full-on workflow](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m26s)

[than testing a small unit in isolation.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m29s)

[So applying unit testing rules to things](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m32s)

[that aren't individual units](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m35s)

[gets you kind of in hot water at times.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m37s)

[Okay, so I think this will be better.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m40s)

[The test went green locally. So, we will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m43s)

[do this. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m46s)

[yeah. And then we're going to send that.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m51s)

[And that guy should go.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h10m54s)

[Wait, did I add this?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m04s)

[Oh, no. This was This was a different](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m10s)

[one. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m12s)

[it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m13s)

[it. Got it. Got it. Okay. I was very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m15s)

[confused for a minute. Okay. So, that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m17s)

[that should go. That's running. That's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m19s)

[running.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m22s)

[Okay. That'll get us going.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m24s)

[That'll get us going.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m28s)

[Okay. I'm happy with that. That That's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m31s)

[not bad. That is not bad.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m34s)

[Oh, and this is going to be the other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m37s)

[one to review. This is This is the next](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m39s)

[big one. Um, this lovely gentleman](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m41s)

[ported over the material color utilities](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m46s)

[library. Like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m50s)

[this is a big deal. Like, and I knew it](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m53s)

[was a big deal when I opened it. I was](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m58s)

[like, "Oh boy, oh boy." So, there's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h11m59s)

[there's a little bit there. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m03s)

[so yeah.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m07s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m12s)

[let's see. Yeah. And he went through um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m16s)

[the board of the library also replace in](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m23s)

[with color for internal usage and break](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m25s)

[with original source](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m26s)

[and multiple searches. Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m31s)

[yeah, this is this is this is very](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m39s)

[similar here, right? Multiple asserts](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m41s)

[per test. See, and this is where I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m43s)

[sometimes break with people is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m45s)

[multiple asserts in my mind aren't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m49s)

[necessarily bad. They could be bad.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m51s)

[They're they're an indication that you](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m54s)

[might be doing too much, but not always.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m55s)

[Right? one logical one you should assert](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h12m58s)

[on one logical thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m04s)

[this is how the code](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m08s)

[so what is I don't I'm not familiar with](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m12s)

[this one let's look which compiler](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m14s)

[warning is this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m18s)

[uh obsolete members](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m20s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m23s)

[interesting okay](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m25s)

[I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m27s)

[Yeah, this I think will be the next one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m30s)

[I want to look at doing because this](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m33s)

[looks](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m36s)

[we can improve the workflow to run. I I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m37s)

[looked at the code previously. I know](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m39s)

[that it's not nefarious. However, it is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m41s)

[there's a lot here and it does it does](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m45s)

[require](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m49s)

[it does require some work. Um, one other](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m51s)

[thing that I will mention, I don't think](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m54s)

[it's going to affect](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m57s)

[this library too much. Um, the the net](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h13m59s)

[02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:13,679](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m05s)

uh 10 uh

[was it um SLA was is that the right](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m10s)

[term? the the new microt net 10 stuff](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m13s)

[comes with a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m18s)

[where is it?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m23s)

[Yeah. So the so one Microsoft increased](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m28s)

[the um the STS support time frame,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m32s)

[right? Um](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m37s)

[which is cool. Like that is awesome. But](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m40s)

[there was a change to net 10. Um, what](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m44s)

[was it? Production license. What did](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m48s)

[they call it? Production SLA.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m50s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m53s)

[because normally people wait.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m54s)

[Yeah. Was it this blog that I saw it in?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h14m58s)

[Uh, go live support license. That's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m01s)

[that's what it is. So, this is something](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m04s)

[Microsoft has not done before to the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m06s)

[best of my knowledge. So release](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m08s)

[candidate one and anybody who wants to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m10s)

[play with this typically what happens is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m12s)

[Microsoft puts out release candidates of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m14s)

[net which is cool right they you can go](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m16s)

[download the latest bits just like I run](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m18s)

[preview visual studio you can get](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m21s)

[preview.net net and you can try stuff.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m23s)

[Um, my prior experience is that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m25s)

[sometimes release candidates, especially](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m27s)

[newer language features,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m30s)

[you often run into hiccups. They aren't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m33s)

[usually like breaking, but often times I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m36s)

[I will see issues like maybe](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m40s)

[IntelliSense doesn't offer it properly](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m42s)

[or maybe some analyzers haven't been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m44s)

[updated to take it into account or](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m45s)

[things of that nature, right? They're](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m47s)

[they're major annoying, but they aren't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m49s)

[like crashing like this is unusable type](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m52s)

[situation, right? They're just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m55s)

[obnoxious.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m56s)

[But this time around, they said, "Hey,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h15m58s)

[we are going to give you a go live](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m02s)

[support license." This is unusual](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m04s)

[because you'll note everything in here](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m06s)

[for Microsoft support license stuff.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m08s)

[None of these are release candidates, RC](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m10s)

[builds, right? This is the first RC](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m12s)

[build in this list where they're saying,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m15s)

["Hey, if you want to go play with Net](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m19s)

[10, we will support your go live](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m21s)

[on a pre-release build." Now, I will](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m26s)

[point something out. The release date is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m29s)

[September 9th. The end of support is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m31s)

[October 14th. This is a tiny window. I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m33s)

[suspect the implication here is that RC2](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m37s)

[is going to come out before October 14th](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m41s)

[and that people who are revving to net](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m44s)

[10 RC1 are in a situation where they can](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m46s)

[rev to RC2 right this is not for the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m49s)

[people that you know updating your](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m52s)

[framework, you know, takes a a long](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m54s)

[turnaround. This is for the people who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m56s)

[are running fast and can afford to to](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h16m58s)

[jump on the new stuff like the same week](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m01s)

[that it's launched type deal, right? But](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m04s)

[it's really cool to see something like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m07s)

[that actually happening because it like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m09s)

[that's a lot of support and faith behind](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m13s)

[a release candidate. Like that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m17s)

[effectively Microsoft saying, "Yeah,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m19s)

[this is this is how well we're testing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m21s)

[our release candidates that we could do](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m25s)

[a go live support license with it." Like](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m28s)

[that's pretty cool. Like that's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m31s)

[very very cool,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m36s)

[right? And so that is in there and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m39s)

[coming and I'm sure there's other cool](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m42s)

[stuff in here, but that was the one that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m44s)

[caught that caught my attention, right?](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m45s)

[You'll note WPF actually got and Windows](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m47s)

[forms both got mentioned in the the uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m51s)

[.NET 10 release candidate right now.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m55s)

[Admittedly, WPF is no new features. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h17m58s)

[quality improvements, which they've been](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m02s)

[hammering on bugs, but it's a small team](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m04s)

[and they can only hammer so quickly,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m06s)

[right? But like Windows Forum's got dark](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m08s)

[mode.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m11s)

[Yes, it's 2025, but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m13s)

[we got fully integrated like it's it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m18s)

[had bits of it there before so it's it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m20s)

[not the it's not like oh brand new type](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m23s)

[thing but it's like yeah cool. So there](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m26s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m30s)

[and I think with that I am probably](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m32s)

[going to call it for tonight. It is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m36s)

[great to be back streaming again. I have](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m38s)

[missed doing this. I have missed coding.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m41s)

[It has sucked being](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m44s)

[doing the uh the home remodeling thing](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m47s)

[because uh](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m49s)

[like using tools is not the same as](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m52s)

[using](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m55s)

[digital tools. I like digital tools](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m56s)

[better.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h18m59s)

[They're much nicer. They're much more](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m01s)

[forgiving. When things break, you just](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m02s)

[fix them. When physical things break,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m05s)

[fixing them is not always trivial. So](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m08s)

[that makes it interesting.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m10s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m12s)

[yeah. So, with that, thank you once](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m14s)

[again everyone for coming and hanging](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m16s)

[out. Um, I'm going to plug the user](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m18s)

[group one last time since I know not](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m21s)

[everyone was here. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m24s)

[the and let me grab that here. We'll go.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m28s)

[Right. So, Spokane.net user group](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m33s)

[events. Oh, it was right there in front](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m36s)

[of me. It's right there in front of me.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m38s)

[This guy here. So, if anybody is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m40s)

[interested in building MCP stuff, um I](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m42s)

[I'll be curious to see how I haven't](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m46s)

[asked him. Um but Ben has been doing all](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m49s)

[of the essential C. Uh so for people who](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m53s)

[haven't seen Essential C#, right,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m57s)

[there's the link of the website. He's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h19m59s)

[been doing a lot of the work on this.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m01s)

[And so he is the brains behind like the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m03s)

[little AI chat button down here, the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m05s)

[some of the authentication stuff,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m07s)

[content improvements, like he is](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m09s)

[effectively the the principal engineer](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m11s)

[on this thing for the last like six](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m13s)

[months. Um,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m16s)

[now I still review PRs and whatnot, but](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m18s)

[he's he's basically been responsible for](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m21s)

[all of it. Uh but this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m23s)

[very good talk because there is actually](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m28s)

[quite a bit of work and AI related stuff](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m30s)

[that we did going into to making that](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m33s)

[website possible. So I don't know how](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m36s)

[much he's going to expound on that or if](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m39s)

[he's going to stick it a little closer](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m42s)

[to some of like the MCP server stuff](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m44s)

[that he built to support it. Um, I've](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m46s)

[told them before that I think a great](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m49s)

[talk would actually be talking about the](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m51s)

[architecture for that essential C site](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m53s)

[because it is shocking how much](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h20m57s)

[infrastructure we have to support one](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m00s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m02s)

[contenty website. It is absolutely](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m04s)

[insane. So, I will probably continue](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m07s)

[babysitting those material design PRs](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m11s)

[just to get everything squared away and](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m13s)

[get those things merged. There's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m16s)

[probably still going to be more test](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m18s)

[fallout. It annoys me that I have such](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m19s)

[flaky tests. I don't like flaky tests.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m21s)

[So, uh especially when I'm fixing them](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m24s)

[in PRs unrelated to them, but it's](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m26s)

[either that or I fix them independently](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m28s)

[and then remerge the PR and find new](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m30s)

[ones and it's I'll fix them in line. So,](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m33s)

[with that, I will tell everyone thank](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m36s)

[you very much for coming and hanging](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m38s)

[out. It feels good to to see so many](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m39s)

[familiar faces uh of people that most of](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m42s)

[you I haven't heard from in a couple](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m46s)

[months because I've been gone. So, great](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m48s)

[to be back back to regular streaming](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m50s)

[schedule at least for the foreseeable](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m53s)

[future. And I will see you all next](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m55s)

[time. Happy coding.](https://youtu.be/O90eUMxA-N4?t=02h21m58s)
