[hello everyone welcome back uh so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m01s)

[tonight I figured I was going to go back](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m04s)

[to the material design and xaml project](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m05s)

[last week we looked at different ways of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m07s)

[doing uh theming brushes and I started](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m09s)

[playing around with uh different things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m12s)

[inside of a demo app over the last week](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m14s)

[I kind of poked at the material design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m16s)

[xaml project and started to figure out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m18s)

[you know okay how are we going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m20s)

[actually do this implementation I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m21s)

[figured we would continue on that and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m23s)

[see if we can start getting in all of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m24s)

[the useful theme brushes since this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m26s)

[going to be a major refactor](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m31s)

[part of me was somewhat tempted to say](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m32s)

[well we might be able to make this in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m34s)

[backwards combat no](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m36s)

[um I'm gonna do my best to not break](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m38s)

[people but at the end of the day it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m40s)

[it's Pro like there's too much being](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m43s)

[changed I don't want to gamble on saying](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m45s)

[well this is a this is a backwards](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m48s)

[compatible change We're not gonna do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m49s)

[that stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m51s)

[but before we Dive In](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m52s)

[Justin Bieber welcome back](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m54s)

[uh for anybody who didn't catch it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h00m56s)

[tonight's brain teaser](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m00s)

[uh this is a simple spot the bug](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m03s)

[so no need to write any code](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m07s)

[this code doesn't work and throws an](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m10s)

[exception the question is what is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m13s)

[exception and why](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m16s)

[now before what I've done with these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m18s)

[brain teasers I threw them up at the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m20s)

[beginning we go back to them at the end](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m21s)

[I'm going to do one better](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m23s)

[not an easy teaser](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m25s)

[that's the point but but for for people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m27s)

[watching on stream you're going to get a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m31s)

[special uh sneak peek tonight so I have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m33s)

[gone through and started](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m37s)

[cataloging my brain teasers into this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m39s)

[Repository so there's a link for anybody](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m42s)

[who wants to play with it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m46s)

[probably nothing new to you Justin](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m47s)

[Bieber since you I think have caught](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m49s)

[every stream where I've done one of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m50s)

[these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m52s)

[um but it does have kind of a list of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m53s)

[getting started and then down below](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m55s)

[you'll find the actual brain teasers and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m57s)

[spot the bug problems so if you prefer](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h01m59s)

[to actually write some code brain](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m01s)

[teasers are where it's at if you like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m03s)

[these kind of hey let's let's see if we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m04s)

[can just uh look into it there's a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m06s)

[couple of these things here I think I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m09s)

[have another five or six cued up on uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m10s)

[tabs from my history of things that I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m14s)

[want to put in here as well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m16s)

[um but the short version there's a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m18s)

[repository here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m19s)

[um and this one is packaging up values](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m21s)

[so if we were to just dive into this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m23s)

[you'll note this is just a branch so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m26s)

[there's a ton of branches in here and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m28s)

[you'll note there's the branch with the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m30s)

[problem and then there's the branch with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m31s)

[the solution](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m33s)

[so if you want to dive in and look at it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m34s)

[more the packaging of value ones is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m37s)

[where things are at there is a hint dot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m38s)

[markdown if if you need a a subtle hint](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m40s)

[along the way but then there is also the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m43s)

[solution Branch with the explanation for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m46s)

[all of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m48s)

[so uh and then I decided I was going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m49s)

[take it a little bit further because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m53s)

[putting them in a repo is good doing a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m54s)

[little write-up is good but then I was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m56s)

[like you know what would be cool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h02m58s)

[is if I went through and I actually made](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m00s)

[up a YouTube video for each of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m02s)

[nothing most of these like typically](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m05s)

[I'll cover them at the end of my streams](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m08s)

[it's you know five minutes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m09s)

[not a lot of time but usually there's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m11s)

[something useful so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m13s)

[there is an unlisted video](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m14s)

[out on my YouTube](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m18s)

[it's not long about a minute just an](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m20s)

[introduction for these brain teasers I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m23s)

[starting to record the videos for at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m26s)

[least the ones that are up here now more](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m27s)

[will be coming so for those people who](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m29s)

[are watching my stream there's the early](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m32s)

[links](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m33s)

[probably see at least a couple of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m35s)

[posted over the next week I'm probably](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m36s)

[going to record them post and then leave](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m38s)

[them and kind of like trickle them out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m41s)

[one or two a week or something like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m46s)

[and then after I get caught up I'll](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m47s)

[put them out whenever I come up with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m50s)

[them since most of the time these just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m52s)

[come about during](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m54s)

[daily jobs or when people share them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m55s)

[with me so I figured here's a fun one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h03m57s)

[we'll go we'll go and do for it so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m01s)

[motivation if anybody's not following my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m02s)

[YouTube channel There's the link](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m04s)

[uh it's it's one of the yeah that one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m06s)

[that one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m09s)

[so but there it is there is the the link](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m11s)

[out to it brain teasers and other](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m13s)

[assorted spot the bug problems coming in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m16s)

[some of them will be hard some of them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m19s)

[will be easy I thought about putting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m22s)

[like a difficulty rating on them and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m24s)

[then I decided not to partly because the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m26s)

[difficulty rating is really subjective](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m28s)

[um and it's really subjective based upon](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m31s)

[somebody's prior knowledge and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m32s)

[experience like you might be really high](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m34s)

[in one area and really low in another](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m36s)

[I'm like I don't know how to balance](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m37s)

[that stuff so they're all just equal but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m39s)

[some are definitely harder than others](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m42s)

[by virtue of some I'm sure more people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m44s)

[will get than others so uh there's all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m47s)

[of those](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m51s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m52s)

[uh before we get into the theme brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m53s)

[I was going to take a look at this one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m55s)

[so this is a bug that cropped up before](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h04m57s)

[and I honestly just lost track of it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m00s)

[because it wasn't wasn't on my radar of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m02s)

[something broken but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m04s)

[um there was an issue that got logged](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m06s)

[um around the the clear uh the clear](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m09s)

[button that shows up unlike your text](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m12s)

[boxes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m14s)

[uh and I think does the pull request](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m15s)

[have a screenshot one of these had it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m18s)

[it's the little X that shows up on the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m20s)

[back side or on the right hand side of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m22s)

[all your text boxes and whatnot to clear](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m23s)

[things out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m25s)

[but the comment was this doesn't work](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m27s)

[with uh control templates okay great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m29s)

[um and the original issue poster made a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m34s)

[call out that there was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m36s)

[um this subtle difference here when](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m38s)

[you're inside of the control template](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m40s)

[the difference between the routed event](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m42s)

[args uh source and the sender of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m44s)

[event these things are not actually the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m47s)

[same object in all cases](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m50s)

[um so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m53s)

[dealing with dealing with this situation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h05m59s)

[uh there was a pull request that came in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m00s)

[that just cleanly swaps this I suspect](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m03s)

[it works just fine but I was going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m06s)

[pull this guy down](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m09s)

[I want to wrap a UI test on top of this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m10s)

[guy just this feels like one of those](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m12s)

[things that we're going to flip-flop and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m14s)

[break repeatedly so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m16s)

[let's go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m17s)

[and do that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m19s)

[uh so I think I actually want to be on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m21s)

[master and or actually we can just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m23s)

[we can probably just push straight to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m26s)

[the pull request oh other announcement](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m28s)

[get cracking uh 910 dropped](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m30s)

[Tuesday Monday this week came out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m35s)

[recently](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m39s)

[a handful of fixes and whatnot the big](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m40s)

[announcement with it was the uh WSL](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m43s)

[support So a bunch of work went into](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m46s)

[making get Kraken on Linux uh work](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m48s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m52s)

[um with WSL though you probably want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m54s)

[get cracking installed twice once inside](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h06m58s)

[your Linux distro and once inside your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m00s)

[windows distro even though you can cross](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m02s)

[that file system boundary back and forth](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m04s)

[there's a performance hit to it and so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m06s)

[it's often nicer to let Windows get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m08s)

[cracking manage repos that are checked](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m10s)

[out in Windows and Linux get cracking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m12s)

[manage repos checked out inside of Linux](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m15s)

[what it's worth](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m17s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m19s)

[yeah there was a bunch of workspace](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m21s)

[updates](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m23s)

[devops workspace now get insights and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m25s)

[I'm trying to remember those were the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m27s)

[ones that stood out to me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m28s)

[uh okay so let's do let's go to town](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m30s)

[here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m33s)

[okay so there's that there's that nice](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m35s)

[and re-based](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m38s)

[and do I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m39s)

[already have it open sweet](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m41s)

[we're gonna close this for now close](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m43s)

[this for now and I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m45s)

[because this guy has just one file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m48s)

[change internal clear text](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m51s)

[let's just go double check that guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m54s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m58s)

[okay so step one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h07m59s)

[bioscope the namespace because I can't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m01s)

[resist](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m04s)

[um I know I'm going to cause myself](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m06s)

[merge conflicts later](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m07s)

[I just I'm happy to deal with them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m09s)

[um okay so this is fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m13s)

[straightforward this is a local function](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m16s)

[inside of a command binding that's being](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m19s)

[wired up to the clear command this is a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m21s)

[routed command](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m23s)

[this seems fairly simple and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m28s)

[straightforward](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m35s)

[uh is it possible to store the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m37s)

[repository itself on WSL Linux and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m38s)

[install get cracking on Windows and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m40s)

[access the WSL project Repository](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m42s)

[so I am not a WSL expert but I think the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m51s)

[answer is no](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m55s)

[the WSL distro can reach back across](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h08m57s)

[into your Windows File system by going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m00s)

[through slash MNT Mount slash SQL and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m02s)

[decolon whatever your drive letter is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m05s)

[and it can come back out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m07s)

[but I don't think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m10s)

[I don't think you can go the other](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m13s)

[direction](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m14s)

[someone may correct me if I'm wrong I've](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m17s)

[never](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m20s)

[I don't know how that would get exposed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m22s)

[out now there may be some sort of config](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m24s)

[settings where you can do a mount or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m26s)

[whatever but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m28s)

[typically you can't get in that way if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m29s)

[you want access to something that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m32s)

[inside your Linux distro you usually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m33s)

[just copy to slash MNT C temp or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m35s)

[whatever that's typically I'll go the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m39s)

[other direction and I'll just copy the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m41s)

[stuff out obviously that's not great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m43s)

[especially if we're talking about like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m45s)

[repo stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m48s)

[yeah I'm not aware of a way to get to go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m52s)

[from Windows inside to your WSL file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m54s)

[system](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m57s)

[uh okay so I would like to do let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h09m59s)

[actually just look at the bug report](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m03s)

[because I think this thing had a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m06s)

[sample of failure](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m08s)

[so it does not work](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m11s)

[so this is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m14s)

[this is the failure case we'd like to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m19s)

[test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m20s)

[ookie so let's go write ourselves a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m22s)

[little UI test because I I kind of feel](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m24s)

[like I wanna make sure we cover this and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m27s)

[I'm trying to decide the appropriate](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m29s)

[place to put the test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m38s)

[normally you have test mirror](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m42s)

[your project structure but this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m47s)

[coming in from the outside and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m49s)

[not directly related](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m52s)

[I think what we're going to do is this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m55s)

[a new folder](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h10m58s)

[content controls](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m01s)

[I think we're just going to do this and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m04s)

[I don't remember](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m06s)

[I need this thingy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m09s)

[uh oh wait wait there's a new thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m13s)

[so this is in Visual Studio preview this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m18s)

[add new item so much nicer if you hit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m20s)

[show all templates it takes you to the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m22s)

[oldie View](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m24s)

[but if you just do your your new file oh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m25s)

[compact View](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m29s)

[much it it also doesn't take the hit of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m31s)

[like loading all the templates so it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m33s)

[faster](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m35s)

[um and I approve of that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m37s)

[uh control s](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m39s)

[and then I just want to derive from test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m43s)

[base to make sure I pick up all my other](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m46s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m48s)

[I want to file scope the namespace](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m50s)

[because that's what we do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m52s)

[and then I want a Constructor with the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m54s)

[appropriate](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m57s)

[thingy in the base I need you public](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h11m59s)

[because X unit will yell if we don't go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m03s)

[there we go there we go there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m07s)

[okay and then no okay Copilot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m09s)

[wrong testing framework](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m14s)

[wrong testing framework uh we're just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m17s)

[gonna grab one of these tests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m19s)

[and then start with that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m22s)

[okay and this was specifically issue](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m24s)

[2510 so let's bring that in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m28s)

[of a bomb](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m32s)

[oh on clear button shown interesting so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m35s)

[that was actually the on clear button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m41s)

[uh let's do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m43s)

[clear button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m44s)

[so three big parts to every test name](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m46s)

[what's being tested the conditions under](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m49s)

[which it's being tested expected outcome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m51s)

[uh clear button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m54s)

[uh let's go with inside of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m56s)

[control template](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h12m59s)

[uh and still clear content](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m02s)

[boom uh so we're gonna go like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m08s)

[we're gonna go like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m10s)

[we're gonna oh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m12s)

[did I rev these things to later oh I did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m15s)

[I'm not gonna do it here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m24s)

[but we could use the new c-sharp 11](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m29s)

[during literals that'd be really slick](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m32s)

[really slick right here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m35s)

[um not gonna do it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m37s)

[might go do that upgrade here in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m39s)

[minute uh let's see I need my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m40s)

[that thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m45s)

[ooh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m48s)

[you paste](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m49s)

[there we are okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m52s)

[unident unandent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h13m55s)

[two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m02s)

[two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m04s)

[one two okay so that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m06s)

[that goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m09s)

[that goes like that we want this guy the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m11s)

[root level thing will be a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m13s)

[content control that's what we're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m16s)

[creating](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m18s)

[we're going to need the text box we're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m19s)

[gonna need the clear button so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m21s)

[convenient we grabbed a convenient one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m22s)

[okay so we're gonna just clear all that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m26s)

[garbage out we don't need any of that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m28s)

[um and let's actually set the text](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m30s)

[property to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m32s)

[uh some text](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m34s)

[just to make that interesting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m39s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m45s)

[that out we don't care about any of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m46s)

[these we don't care about any of those](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m48s)

[don't care about any of that okay so our](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m50s)

[ax portion is going to be to click the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m53s)

[button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m56s)

[and then I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m57s)

[assert](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h14m58s)

[equal on empty string of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m01s)

[away](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m04s)

[Xbox get text](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m06s)

[something like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m16s)

[uh uh let's run it and in theory this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m18s)

[should go green because the the fix is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m21s)

[in but if as long as this goes green](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m24s)

[what we're going to do is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m26s)

[undo the fix make sure the test goes red](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m28s)

[we're going to do red green testing in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m32s)

[Reverse green red](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m33s)

[it'll be more exciting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m35s)

[it went red that's not right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m48s)

[oh expected empty string actual null](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m51s)

[interesting is the expected value of a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h15m58s)

[text box](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m01s)

[null](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m02s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m08s)

[uh I wanna pause this guy and just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m09s)

[double check that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m12s)

[I'm a little surprised of getting Noel](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m20s)

[back but not completely surprised](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m26s)

[actually let's do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m31s)

[bring](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m34s)

[initial](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m36s)

[gets a weight](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m38s)

[text box uh get text I just want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m40s)

[verify that we're getting the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m44s)

[initial because we're asserting that it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m47s)

[goes to empty](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m49s)

[we should probably make sure that that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m52s)

[guy got set up correctly](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m54s)

[um and I want to do where is my unhook](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h16m57s)

[debugger](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m03s)

[uh where is the unhooked debugger](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m06s)

[is it in the base](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m10s)

[uh that's where I just was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m13s)

[those are the initialize](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m19s)

[uh allow Visual Studio debugger attach](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m22s)

[I do not wish to attach the debugger](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m26s)

[because I want to pause my test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m28s)

[but not pause the running app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m33s)

[a chair is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m40s)

[the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m41s)

[little pumpy thing on my chair that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m43s)

[keeps it up it slowly has been going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m44s)

[down down down down down](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m46s)

[and as someone who is fairly tall I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m50s)

[prefer to be up high](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m55s)

[uh why I set that break point](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h17m59s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m09s)

[okay move you off to the side](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m10s)

[okay so let's see initial](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m13s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m16s)

[then I want to bring this guy over here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m18s)

[so he's down here somewhere I just can't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m20s)

[I probably can't find it because I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m23s)

[willing to bet the thing went to zero](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m25s)

[width when the text got cleared](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m30s)

[uh you'll find it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m33s)

[uh see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m35s)

[oh I actually landed right on oh the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m39s)

[whole thing is the text box excellent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m41s)

[I don't think it's going to show show me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m45s)

[null or anything fancy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m49s)

[and then if we step over this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h18m52s)

[got it and actually let's Okay so that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m01s)

[that's that's all fine let's do this uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m04s)

[let's change this up because I really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m07s)

[don't care that much between null or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m10s)

[empty](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m12s)

[what I care about is that it is cleared](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m14s)

[and let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m17s)

[let's just assert equal on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m19s)

[some text on initial](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m23s)

[just so that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m27s)

[now the test should pass just just to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m30s)

[make sure that our precondition isn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m33s)

[weirded out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m35s)

[in general this is kind of odd to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m39s)

[because this violates the rule of having](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m40s)

[a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m42s)

[a test test exactly one thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m43s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m47s)

[is that using okay so there's that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m49s)

[test is working so let's go and turn the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m52s)

[fix off](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m54s)

[so the fix here was e dot Source before](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h19m57s)

[and this should Now fail](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m03s)

[good okay so the the test validates that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m19s)

[it does in fact work appropriately](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m23s)

[wonderful okay so let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m25s)

[let's check changes view changes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m29s)

[uh let's see content control tests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m32s)

[good](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m37s)

[we want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m38s)

[I don't really want to commit that we're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m40s)

[going to turn that off for now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m43s)

[filescope namespace great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m44s)

[uh adding UI test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m48s)

[with the condition](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m52s)

[we will commit and hopefully push](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m54s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h20m59s)

[don't have access](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m01s)

[disappointing disappointed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m05s)

[um well there is more than one way to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m09s)

[handle this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m12s)

[so short version is we know the pr is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m13s)

[good so what we're going to do is we are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m16s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m20s)

[wash and merge this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m23s)

[we're going to mark this thing as](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m27s)

[uh completed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m30s)

[and it will go out in the 4 8 release](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m33s)

[and then we are just going to do our own](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m35s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m38s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m39s)

[where's crepe Branch why am I blind](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m45s)

[create Branch here uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m47s)

[I don't want it to be here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m51s)

[show me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m52s)

[there should be a new commit there fetch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m54s)

[there we are I want to be here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m57s)

[reset local and now I want to create a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h21m59s)

[branch uh and UI test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m02s)

[and then I want to take this little guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m06s)

[and I want to go cherry pick](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m07s)

[cherry pick](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m10s)

[so when you cherry pick a commit all it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m12s)

[does is make a copy of it and replace it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m14s)

[at this point which is convenient](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m16s)

[because these should be in the exact](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m18s)

[same States](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m20s)

[we don't care about that so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m22s)

[delete that now that I have it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m23s)

[uh let's see and I don't need this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m26s)

[remote anymore so remove the remote](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m28s)

[and then here we'll just drag it onto](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m31s)

[here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m33s)

[uh push and start pull request uh sure I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m34s)

[don't care](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m37s)

[I don't really care which one it goes to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m40s)

[adding UI test for uh was it 25](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m41s)

[something with a nine](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m46s)

[uh 2510](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m49s)

[or issue 25](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m53s)

[00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,120](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h22m57s)

uh

[wow](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m15s)

[you crack and I thought you would fix](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m16s)

[this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m18s)

[apparently not that's disappointing I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m23s)

[might have to go in log a bug](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m29s)

[because it has trouble when it's loading](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m30s)

[that list and there are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m32s)

[3200 Forks](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m34s)

[it's a lot uh okay let's just validate](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m38s)

[our changes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m42s)

[this thing is showing this has white](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m46s)

[space enabled so it's showing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m48s)

[extra stuff here when it's really just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m50s)

[white space](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m51s)

[uh so we're gonna create pull request](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m52s)

[add it into the milestone](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h23m58s)

[uh we're gonna enable auto merge](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m01s)

[firm Auto merge](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m05s)

[and that should just go now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m08s)

[yeah so if we turn on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m11s)

[the white space hide white space apply](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m13s)

[and reload](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m16s)

[there we go now it appropriately shows](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m18s)

[it without it being ugly](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m21s)

[there's that there's that perfect](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m22s)

[okay there's all of that it's wonderful](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m25s)

[it's in it's done 480 is chugging along](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m28s)

[there's a handful of pull requests that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m31s)

[I'm probably going to aim to try to get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m33s)

[into the 4-8 release so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m34s)

[um specifically Nikolai has a great fix](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m37s)

[here that I'm gonna try to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m40s)

[wait and sneak in I was kind of holding](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m42s)

[off on doing the 4-8 somewhat](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m44s)

[intentionally dragging my feet just to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m46s)

[see if anything else jumped in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m47s)

[but there was also a couple other uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m50s)

[issues that got logged that I was like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m53s)

[I get motivated we're gonna go fix them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m56s)

[but right now I am motivated for theme](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h24m58s)

[brushes so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m00s)

[let's talk theme brushes Bean brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m02s)

[steam brushes steam brushes okay so the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m04s)

[5-0 branch is sitting out there with a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m06s)

[bunch of the 5-0 changes in it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m11s)

[um but on top of that I've got this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m12s)

[color thoughts thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m14s)

[that I've been poking at let's go take a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m16s)

[look at it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m19s)

[uh I switched branches yep](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m21s)

[uh here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m24s)

[uh close all this okay so inside of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m26s)

[uh resource gen project](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m31s)

[um one I went through the the launch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m35s)

[settings and I started just adding in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m38s)

[couple more thingies specifically this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m40s)

[generate brushes and if you end up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m43s)

[looking at this code it's a hot mess](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m45s)

[I realize it's a hot mess there's a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m48s)

[reason it's sitting on a branch I was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m51s)

[playing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m53s)

[sometimes when you're playing you just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m53s)

[go uh so if we look at program we come](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m56s)

[down here to brushes you'll note that my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h25m59s)

[incredible awesome naming strategy was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m01s)

[do stuff async](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m03s)

[that's the level we're at do stuff async](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m06s)

[um I don't know why I have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m10s)

[a record struck sitting there that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m13s)

[great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m16s)

[okay and at some point I've got high](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m19s)

[hopes of like restructuring this tooling](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m20s)

[because there's tooling I want to build](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m22s)

[like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m24s)

[it seems weird but I enjoy building](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m26s)

[tools for Developers](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m28s)

[and I'm building tools to build tools](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m29s)

[for developers there's got to be at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m31s)

[least one more level of recursion I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m33s)

[sure I can get three levels deep](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m34s)

[okay so what I've got is this theme](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m36s)

[colors dot Json file I've actually got a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m38s)

[couple jsons](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m40s)

[but if we go looking here that so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m41s)

[my previous attempt there was a Json](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m44s)

[file that looked like this latest](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m46s)

[attempt is a Json file that looks like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m50s)

[it's nothing fancy but you can start to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m51s)

[see the newer brush names you can see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m52s)

[that there are theme colors](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m55s)

[and you can see that most of them are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h26m57s)

[referencing Colors by name rather than](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m00s)

[by](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m04s)

[exact value there are a handful of them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m05s)

[though that are still using RGB code so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m07s)

[the code is hip to knowing the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m10s)

[difference between a string that starts](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m12s)

[with a pound and a string that doesn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m14s)

[it's it's no more advanced than that but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m16s)

[this gives me a centralized place where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m19s)

[I can start to Define stuff out in order](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m21s)

[to build it out and you'll note I'm also](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m23s)

[defining these obsolete Keys as well for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m25s)

[no other reason other than this gives me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m27s)

[a migration path because I got going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m30s)

[down this and I realized I'm like you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m32s)

[know](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m34s)

[I could give people a cleaner migration](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m35s)

[path](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m37s)

[so I may not completely ax the brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m39s)

[in 5.0 not promising may still decide to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m43s)

[ask them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m46s)

[um we'll see how it goes Andrew welcome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m47s)

[we're gonna we're gonna do some some](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m50s)

[old code generation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m53s)

[the the slow old-fashioned way](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h27m56s)

[um okay and then what I did and what I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m00s)

[did is I got I got a little crazy I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m04s)

[started going down some color theory](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m06s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m07s)

[and kind of jumped in on the deep end](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m08s)

[jumped in on the deep I jumped off the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m11s)

[deep end let's be honest uh so if we go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m13s)

[material design colors](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m15s)

[uh color system that's the M2 where's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m18s)

[the M3 okay so there are two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m21s)

[similar and slightly is there not a dark](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m25s)

[theme on this one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m28s)

[oh okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m29s)

[so the color system in material design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m31s)

[is fairly well defined it's it's they've](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m33s)

[they've put together a lot of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m37s)

[information](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m38s)

[um and so I was left with this idea of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m40s)

[going okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m42s)

[how much do we put it and I was](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m43s)

[realizing that in material design 2 they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m45s)

[had primary and secondary and we are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m49s)

[just now ready to have that rename](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m51s)

[happen and I noticed that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m53s)

[they also on material design 3 have this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h28m57s)

[tertiary color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m00s)

[and I went kidnap it dang navit do I go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m02s)

[through an added tertiary color to this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m05s)

[do people actually want it like when I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m07s)

[added the dark and light variants to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m09s)

[secondary I don't know if anyone cared](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m11s)

[I'm kind of suspecting most people don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m15s)

[care about a tertiary color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m17s)

[I'm still on the fence whether we're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m20s)

[going to add it or not because it seems](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m21s)

[weird to add a a theme color that isn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m23s)

[consumed by any controls because then I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m26s)

[gotta find her use for it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m28s)

[but I think my middle ground is this new](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m30s)

[way of laying out the resource](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m33s)

[dictionaries is going to allow people to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m35s)

[add their own in so I might just skip](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m37s)

[tertiary and tell people if you want it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m39s)

[you add it none of the built-in controls](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m41s)

[are using it if you need it you can slap](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m43s)

[it in and have fun](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m45s)

[um but there is this fairly nice layout](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m47s)

[in how this is going and it's it's nice](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m51s)

[that they have this primary secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m54s)

[and tertiary but this other one that I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m56s)

[wanted to call out was this neutral](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m58s)

[colors this is where things got](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h29m59s)

[interesting uh where was it okay this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m01s)

[tonal palette so this is where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m05s)

[I don't know if this was right I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m08s)

[it's right but you'll note zero is black](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m11s)

[a hundred is white](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m14s)

[okay zero black 100 White](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m16s)

[um and then they break it across into uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m21s)

[13 tones](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m24s)

[uh going from all the way up I don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m27s)

[fully understand this 99 to 100. I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m31s)

[I broke it into 12 tones rather than 13.](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m35s)

[and maybe I shouldn't maybe I shouldn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m39s)

[do that but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m41s)

[what I did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m53s)

[uh was it here that I did it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m54s)

[trying to remember](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h30m56s)

[oh no I made an internals directory](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m01s)

[uh on the news uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m04s)

[did you recently watch the MS conference](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m07s)

[on the new search Edge built in chat GPT](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m09s)

[can you comment on that and what will](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m11s)

[happen to free search engines like Dr go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m14s)

[that don't have ai capabilities](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m19s)

[so I will so I have not seen the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m20s)

[conference but I am aware of the update](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m23s)

[and I did uh go and sign up for the the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m25s)

[preview of being that's supposed to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m30s)

[the the AI augmented version I didn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m32s)

[get in yet crossing fingers uh but I did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m34s)

[go and sign up for it because I always](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m37s)

[like playing with new stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m42s)

[I think it's a little bit of to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m43s)

[determined like I I I'm hoping what this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m45s)

[ends up being is a search engine that is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m48s)

[the co-pilot equivalent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m53s)

[only for searching right they've got](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m55s)

[some cool demos that I've seen where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h31m58s)

[they they show things like oh let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m00s)

[schedule my vacation and you can have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m01s)

[this kind of more natural language](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m03s)

[interaction which is kind of nice](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m04s)

[um with that said I don't think things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m08s)

[like DuckDuckGo and whatnot are going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m10s)

[end up dying like so a lot of people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m14s)

[that I know that use DuckDuckGo their](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m19s)

[primary purpose of using it isn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m22s)

[because they think it gives better](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m24s)

[search results than the Alternatives](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m25s)

[they usually are using it because they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m28s)

[like their privacy and with things like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m31s)

[Bing or Google especially if you're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m34s)

[signed in they're tracking you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m36s)

[like and and sometimes it's really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m38s)

[painfully obvious that they're tracking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m40s)

[you like I've had my siblings send me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m42s)

[links on Amazon I click on it you know](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m44s)

[and I I open it up and then immediately](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m46s)

[every search engine thinks that I'm now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m49s)

[in the market for you know whatever item](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m51s)

[I clicked on rubber duckies and now I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m52s)

[getting spam for rubber duck](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m55s)

[advertisements it's really painfully](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m56s)

[obvious](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h32m58s)

[um so I don't think those things would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m00s)

[like I I don't see something like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m03s)

[duckduck go going away because they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m05s)

[don't have ai because that's that's not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m07s)

[people's primary motivation for using it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m10s)

[or at least the the individuals that I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m12s)

[know that use DuckDuckGo their primary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m14s)

[motivation is privacy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m16s)

[and I it would probably take some really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m19s)

[amazing results out of like being in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m23s)

[Google to get somebody to be willing to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m25s)

[give give that up right because there is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m27s)

[a trade-off if you if you aren't paying](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m30s)

[for the product you are the product](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m31s)

[generally the the consensus so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m34s)

[yeah I don't know if that helps that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m37s)

[much I will say I still like chat GPT I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m39s)

[love Copilot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m42s)

[I side note on co-pilot if you do my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m44s)

[brain teaser repo don't go and like turn](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m47s)

[co-pilot off co-pilot blatantly cheats](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m50s)

[it spoils the answers it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m53s)

[I was it was it was helping me write one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m57s)

[of the solutions not only did it get the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h33m59s)

[solution correct it cited the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m01s)

[appropriate Microsoft docs page where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m03s)

[the answer was I'm like they NAB you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m05s)

[co-pilot you're ruining the ending stop](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m06s)

[it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m09s)

[it was both impressive and slightly sad](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m10s)

[all at the same time](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m13s)

[okay uh anyway so I went and did this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m16s)

[base themes color because uh with the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m20s)

[idea of it being the rough equivalent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m23s)

[yeah no problem uh with the idea of this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m25s)

[internal one being the rough equivalent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m28s)

[of this tonal palette for the neutral](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m30s)

[colors and you'll note here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m32s)

[you've got neutral 50 I I left off I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m35s)

[could probably do neutral zero and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m39s)

[neutral like a thousand but there's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m41s)

[literally no difference between white](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m44s)

[zero and white 1000 and neutral zero and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m46s)

[neutral one thousand so and I wasn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m49s)

[sure how to do this so the neutral ones](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m51s)

[run](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m53s)

[with Alpha](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m54s)

[set at 255 or FF](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h34m57s)

[and then walk their way up in in steady](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m00s)

[increments right and I didn't do the 95](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m04s)

[and I didn't do the 1000 like again I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m06s)

[just picked because I don't actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m09s)

[need that many](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m10s)

[and I was kind of torn whether I should](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m12s)

[add things in that I didn't need and in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m13s)

[fact I don't even think I need all of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m16s)

[these I think the the built-in Library](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m17s)

[when I looked is only using like six of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m19s)

[these I was like do I need them all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m21s)

[I'm def I was like I've got the values I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m25s)

[might as well Define them for now I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m27s)

[might delete them later we'll see until](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m28s)

[it tell it until it ships I can delete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m30s)

[anything I want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m32s)

[um so I did the neutral colors and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m34s)

[the white and black ones you'll know](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m36s)

[these ones are subtly different and I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m38s)

[wasn't sure how to handle this case](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m40s)

[because there's a lot of uh of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m42s)

[built-in brushes you'll note rather than](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m45s)

[having the alpha fixed at fully opaque](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m47s)

[they range from completely transparent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m50s)

[to completely opaque on the other side](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m54s)

[and then same thing for black because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m57s)

[what I found was when I was looking at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h35m59s)

[the the brush values that were actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m01s)

[being used in the library](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m03s)

[I most most of the brushes that were not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m05s)

[related to one of the color themes right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m09s)

[because the color themes you've got your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m11s)

[primary and secondary color and variance](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m12s)

[on that whatever](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m14s)

[a lot of the other ones uh you know your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m15s)

[shadow colors your your border colors](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m18s)

[your separator colors](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m21s)

[um all of those were either variants of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m23s)

[white or black depending on whether you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m26s)

[were light or dark theme or some variant](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m28s)

[on neutral](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m30s)

[and so I put this together](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m33s)

[right and so this is just a straight](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m35s)

[resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m37s)

[in the repository I put it underneath](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m39s)

[internal because technically there's not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m42s)

[a clean way to hide exposing resources](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m44s)

[because the resources have to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m47s)

[available when somebody references it so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m48s)

[it's not like I can make them private or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m50s)

[anything it's like whatever but I I put](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m51s)

[them underneath an internals directory](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m54s)

[that way if anybody wants to reference](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m55s)

[this dictionary directly it should be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m57s)

[clear to them this is something internal](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h36m59s)

[don't get you know don't go too crazy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m01s)

[and then for the light and dark ones](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m04s)

[what is this thing squawking about](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m07s)

[oh it's just unhappy because I haven't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m09s)

[compiled](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m11s)

[um so I poached](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m12s)

[these two classes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m14s)

[from the ma apps project](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m17s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m20s)

[I I probably need to go through and do a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m21s)

[better job of citing the exactly where I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m23s)

[grabbed them from](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m26s)

[um but I was again this was plain and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m28s)

[just trying to get it working first](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m30s)

[um oh this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m32s)

[oops](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m35s)

[that's a bug whoopsie anyway](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m38s)

[um but the idea here it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m42s)

[um is allowing the the separation of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m45s)

[these dictionaries so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m48s)

[by having a separation in the dictionary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m51s)

[it leaves an opportunity for somebody](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m53s)

[else to be able to inject a value what](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m55s)

[do I need let's look at the demo app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h37m57s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m02s)

[um I fully intend to still have the the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m06s)

[default kind of bundled theme approach](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m09s)

[for doing theming because there there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m10s)

[are some people who bring in the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m14s)

[material design library and they just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m15s)

[want it to drive the themey they want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m18s)

[set some colors and then they don't want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m20s)

[to think about theming they want it to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m22s)

[do all of the work and have it be easy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m24s)

[great got you covered Don't Panic right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m26s)

[there's a middle ground where or where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m29s)

[people are like well I I want you to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m32s)

[some of it but I still want to be in the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m34s)

[driver's seat and for those cases I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m36s)

[think I'm gonna have to push I don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m39s)

[know if I'm going to try to handle more](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m40s)

[advanced use cases with the simple](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m42s)

[one-liner right this simple one-liner in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m43s)

[my mind these are for people who just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m46s)

[want to set it forget it and move on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m48s)

[great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m50s)

[uh for those people who want the the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m52s)

[easy file new project use case will make](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m54s)

[it easy I'll do my best and obviously](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h38m57s)

[there's the custom color one what two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m00s)

[where you can type in your own RGB](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m01s)

[colors or whatever](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m03s)

[but for people who want to get a little](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m04s)

[more fancy like maybe you've got a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m06s)

[designer on your team at the office](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m08s)

[um and you're like well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m10s)

[I don't want to take your default color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m12s)

[themes we've got our own you know design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m14s)

[palette I want to plug my palette in I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m16s)

[want you to mostly drive but I want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m18s)

[override a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m20s)

[this is where this is where I think I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m21s)

[think things are going to land so the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m24s)

[idea here is then you pull in the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m26s)

[theming resource dictionaries and this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m28s)

[is how the theming was done in the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m30s)

[library up until](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m31s)

[I think three eight three nine somewhere](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m34s)

[in that range right right before the 4-0](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m38s)

[release](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m40s)

[um is when I brought in this simple](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m42s)

[version but previously this is what](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m44s)

[people ended up doing is you had to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m46s)

[bring in these resource dictionaries you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m48s)

[had to make sure you specified a light](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m49s)

[or dark themed one and then you had to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m51s)

[make sure that you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m53s)

[um picked on an appropriate uh primary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h39m55s)

[and accent theme and I'm probably going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m00s)

[to rename these from accent to secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m02s)

[as well just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m03s)

[I'm in here I'm breaking stuff for 5.0](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m05s)

[we're going to get all the naming to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m07s)

[match the Google spec as close as I can](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m09s)

[come up with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m11s)

[um just so that they're done because I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m13s)

[want Google's documentation to match](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m15s)

[what's in the library to cause this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m17s)

[little confusion like there's already](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m19s)

[enough people who struggle with getting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m21s)

[some of this stuff right having the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m22s)

[names different just makes it worse](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m24s)

[so but this now allows for the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m26s)

[opportunity to be able to inject your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m29s)

[own brushes right in the middle right I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m32s)

[I could even go as simple as my solid](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m34s)

[color brush](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m36s)

[or I guess I'm inside of a merge](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m38s)

[dictionary collection I could come out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m39s)

[here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m41s)

[and do something like a solid color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m42s)

[brush X key right material dot design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m44s)

[dot background](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m49s)

[value or value what am I saying color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m51s)

[red right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m54s)

[and if I and if I could Spell correctly](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h40m58s)

[this gives because of the separation of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m00s)

[the dictionaries this now gives people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m03s)

[an opportunity to do their own level of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m04s)

[injection](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m07s)

[which I think is a lot better this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m09s)

[also where I would probably push people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m12s)

[if they wanted a tertiary color as well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m13s)

[right set up your own resource](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m15s)

[dictionary with your tertiary color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m18s)

[apply it to whatever controls make sense](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m20s)

[but if I don't have any built-in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m23s)

[controls that are using it it's probably](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m25s)

[not that valuable and that's why I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m27s)

[most people haven't cared about a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m29s)

[tertiary color in the library](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m30s)

[is because you've got built-in styles](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m32s)

[for primary and secondary and secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m35s)

[there's only some and for the ones where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m38s)

[it doesn't exist it's usually a matter](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m40s)

[of setting a foreground or a background](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m42s)

[brush and you're done](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m44s)

[not not exactly a heavy lift so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m46s)

[um but that is where that lands and so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m50s)

[what I was then doing is on all of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m54s)

[guys here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h41m58s)

[it's generating out all of the new](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m00s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m02s)

[and you'll note it's taking these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m03s)

[brushes and referencing these resource](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m04s)

[keys to be able to go back](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m06s)

[right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m09s)

[giving it a little bit of control over](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m10s)

[where things end up there are a few](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m13s)

[things that are still hard coded and I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m15s)

[haven't quite decided I I think what I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m18s)

[going to push for is evaluating some of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m20s)

[these brushes to move them because I've](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m23s)

[already taken some of the brushes that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m25s)

[were previously defined and shifted them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m27s)

[a little bit either a little darker or a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m28s)

[little lighter so that they land on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m30s)

[those nice shared resources because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m32s)

[there was a lot of resources where they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m34s)

[were only differing by a few points on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m35s)

[the RGB and I put them side by side I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m37s)

[going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m40s)

[there is not that big of a difference I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m40s)

[highly doubt anyone's going to notice so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m43s)

[I was like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m45s)

[we're just gonna go for it so the other](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m47s)

[thing that I did is I was like well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m50s)

[if I've already got the old brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m53s)

[right for my my Json thing I've got the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m56s)

[old names](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h42m59s)

[I can kind of just forward those things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m00s)

[through to the new brush theme for you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m03s)

[what I will probably end up doing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m07s)

[instead is rather than having this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m09s)

[inside of this resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m11s)

[I think what I'm going to do is I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m13s)

[going to have a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m16s)

[additional resource dictionary because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m18s)

[you only need this if you're using these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m20s)

[brush names inside of your app which is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m23s)

[possible like it's fairly common for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m25s)

[people to do so if you're using these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m27s)

[brush names inside your app and you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m29s)

[don't want to go through the pain of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m32s)

[doing the rename](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m33s)

[what I'm going to what I think my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m34s)

[solution is going to be is to add in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m37s)

[new an additional resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m39s)

[that's like obsolete brush keys or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m41s)

[something like that so then you would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m43s)

[end up in your app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m45s)

[um you do something like material design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m48s)

[uh obsolete brushes right so you would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m51s)

[add something like this into your your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m56s)

[app and then you would also get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h43m58s)

[um this thing here so ideally I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m02s)

[convinced people to upgrade and the fact](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m05s)

[that I call it something like obsolete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m07s)

[brush is hopefully strongly hints to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m08s)

[people this is going away please migrate](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m10s)

[at some point but I realize some people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m13s)

[can't migrate willy-nilly right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m16s)

[especially if you've got maybe a massive](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m18s)

[app with hundreds or thousands of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m20s)

[things scattered even if I tell you the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m23s)

[find and replace to do that's still a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m25s)

[big change and you know if you make a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m27s)

[big change to your app sometimes that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m30s)

[has ramifications for testing and all of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m31s)

[this for a rollout that's not always](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m34s)

[easy I get it right totally get it so I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m36s)

[figured I would at least try to give](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m40s)

[people a shim to to get them through](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m42s)

[but with the understanding that that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m45s)

[shim is prob like it's not going to pick](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m46s)

[up the new stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m49s)

[you're going to be kind of heart limited](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m51s)

[I'm not adding old shim brushes there so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m53s)

[plan on updating please please at some](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m56s)

[point but I figured that would at least](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h44m58s)

[make the migration path a little bit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m00s)

[simpler for people so but for now I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m02s)

[dropped them straight in now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m05s)

[in doing that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m07s)

[in doing that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m09s)

[what this means is I have gone through](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m12s)

[and changed a bunch of brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m15s)

[so if we look at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m18s)

[what I do here I I changed a bunch of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m21s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m23s)

[uh yeah I want that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m24s)

[don't care about that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m27s)

[I want that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m31s)

[uh yeah sure whatever stage y'all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m36s)

[I want to do I want to do this really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m38s)

[quick so I want to squash all four of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m40s)

[these commits](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m42s)

[I want to show](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m44s)

[the results of running these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m46s)

[so if we go in here and look so here's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m48s)

[your light and dark themes massive](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m51s)

[changes because of those brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m53s)

[right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m55s)

[oh look at that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m57s)

[there's the obsolete brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h45m59s)

[they'll hang it up there so I gotta](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m04s)

[figure out what I'm doing with that uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m06s)

[but here you'll note you know 150 files](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m09s)

[changed this is going to be a small](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m13s)

[commit small small 80](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m15s)

[a little commit but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m17s)

[um you'll know a lot of these are just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m20s)

[formatting changes because Kevin had](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m22s)

[incorrectly formatted these files before](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m24s)

[oops](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m26s)

[they go back to that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m30s)

[but this goes through and changes out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m31s)

[all of the or adds in all of the primary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m35s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m38s)

[and brings all of those through](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m40s)

[and then does the same thing for all the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m43s)

[accent ones so I've got this thing in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m45s)

[state where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m48s)

[I should be running again and I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m50s)

[pretty sure if I remember correctly this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m52s)

[works](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h46m54s)

[but my goal is to get it to the point](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m01s)

[where this resource generator](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m03s)

[app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m05s)

[basically does most of the work for me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m06s)

[and ideally generates me my deltas](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m09s)

[as you can see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m16s)

[um it blows up immediately and dies](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m17s)

[because that is what](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m19s)

[uh resource reference expression I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m28s)

[wonder if that Dynamic change that I did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m31s)

[is what's Breaking Me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m33s)

[hang on I have a I have a suspicion](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m35s)

[I have a small suspicion](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m41s)

[don't do this it's bad](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m46s)

[what we're gonna see here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m51s)

[if I was right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m54s)

[the convenient part is because all yeah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m57s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h47m59s)

[there it's in there it works](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m00s)

[color tool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m04s)

[you can see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m08s)

[we've got all of this in and going but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m11s)

[this is in and working by virtue of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m13s)

[fact that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m17s)

[the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m18s)

[the brushes are all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m21s)

[the old the old keys are still working](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m23s)

[there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m25s)

[which is both good and terrifying right](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m27s)

[because I think buttons is a good](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m30s)

[example of showing off all of them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m31s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m36s)

[still so we're in a working state](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m39s)

[with all of the resources](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m42s)

[um and I think what I would like to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m45s)

[is I think I want to kill off this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m47s)

[Dynamic one so I think knowing that this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m49s)

[is just static not Dynamic we're gonna](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m51s)

[we're gonna just burn this down to begin](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m53s)

[with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m55s)

[um and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h48m58s)

[let's go back and we need to do the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m01s)

[resource gen brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m05s)

[because all of this is this just needs](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m09s)

[to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m12s)

[this needs to become Static](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m15s)

[this needs to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m19s)

[static](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m22s)

[that goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m25s)

[that goes like that I really need to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m27s)

[clean a bunch of this code up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m29s)

[but right now we're just interested in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m31s)

[go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m34s)

[let's clean this up too explicit type](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m35s)

[while we're in here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m38s)

[numerable empty](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m40s)

[fix the null case handle the null case](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m45s)

[and use explicit type that's fine](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m51s)

[I'm so visual studio preview don't don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m53s)

[preview build](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m57s)

[um they added the new a spell checker](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h49m58s)

[which as somebody who can't spell to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m00s)

[save his life I love the spell checker](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m03s)

[I'm very much on the fence because it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m05s)

[doesn't have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m07s)

[or doesn't appear to have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m09s)

[a ton of functionality](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m11s)

[like there's various other extensions](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m14s)

[that exist for spell checking and code](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m16s)

[that have existed for a long time](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m18s)

[um and really my only options are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m22s)

[telling it to ignore or disable or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m24s)

[rename like these are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m27s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m34s)

[I'm not renaming it with a hype](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m41s)

[what I will do though to make the spell](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m43s)

[checker my to make the spell checker](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m45s)

[shut up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m47s)

[I will capitalize it to make it happy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m49s)

[like on one hand I will say it has saved](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m52s)

[me a lot of embarrassment of typo in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m54s)

[words](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m56s)

[on the other hand I kind of wanted to go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m58s)

[away most of the time okay resource gen](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h50m59s)

[brushes here we go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m02s)

[and this should make a mess of all of my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m04s)

[resource dictionaries](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m07s)

[done](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m09s)

[view changes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m14s)

[uh yeah there we go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m17s)

[so it made a mess of all the resource](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m20s)

[dictionaries](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m22s)

[redid them all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m24s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m26s)

[okay so that that goes like that that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m28s)

[goes like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m30s)

[now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m31s)

[one of the other things I would love to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m33s)

[do is have this thing audit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m35s)

[old brush to new brush](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m37s)

[we're gonna do that at a later point](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m44s)

[because I do I do want an audit of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m46s)

[all of the old brush colors and what the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m50s)

[new ones are and any of them that aren't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m52s)

[exact matches because I kind of hand did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m54s)

[a bunch of them by just looking at them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m57s)

[and that's not a great way of doing this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h51m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m03s)

[stream implements uh disposable async](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m07s)

[will just jump into that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m09s)

[uh okay I don't know if I need any of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m11s)

[this stuff anymore this is all I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m14s)

[dead code](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m17s)

[and this brush tree is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m26s)

[this brush tree is around building some](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m28s)

[code that we don't have yet](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m30s)

[and brush is old is the old](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m33s)

[um Json spec format that I wrote I don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m35s)

[think I need it yet but we're going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m38s)

[just leave it for now okay so that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m40s)

[handles that that handles that let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m42s)

[look at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m44s)

[changing over all of my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m47s)

[brushes I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m51s)

[well let's let's make sure the app fires](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m53s)

[up still](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m55s)

[I'm trying to keep this thing in a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m56s)

[workable State as much as possible so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h52m58s)

[that I don't end up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m01s)

[I don't want to get into a situation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m04s)

[where it's broken for days and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m05s)

[Kevin forgets what he was doing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m07s)

[that happens a lot I don't like to admit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m10s)

[it but it happens a lot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m12s)

[okay so that works](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m13s)

[okay probably good enough I I typically](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m17s)

[go to the buttons page because I know](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m20s)

[that it actually exercises a lot of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m22s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m24s)

[because there's a lot of different theme](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m25s)

[brushes being used across all of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m27s)

[templates here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m29s)

[so it works out really well as a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m30s)

[a reasonable test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m33s)

[the Ripple works](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m36s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m39s)

[cool cool cool cool cool okay so that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m40s)

[that worked there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m42s)

[if we drop the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m44s)

[I kind of want to change up and drop so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m50s)

[the the accent and primary ones](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m54s)

[are being done like this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h53m58s)

[I kind of want to move these into their](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m01s)

[own obsolete brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m03s)

[I think that's what I want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m12s)

[I'm just going to double check these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m15s)

[so where did we put that obsolete's one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m18s)

[because I would like it generated if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m22s)

[it's not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m24s)

[dark light obsolete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m29s)

[um this is not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m37s)

[good](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m40s)

[so I don't want this what I really want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m43s)

[to do is these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m45s)

[into an obsolete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m50s)

[brushes and forward it on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m53s)

[um where is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h54m59s)

[I think I want to just put them all in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m03s)

[one don't I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m05s)

[think that's what I want to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m07s)

[and by all in one I'm referring to the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m09s)

[the primary brushes the secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m12s)

[brushes because right now those ones are](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m13s)

[generated separately from the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m15s)

[we'll call it neutral light dark themed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m18s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m21s)

[and I'm wondering if I want to pull](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m23s)

[those in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m25s)

[uh I should probably flatten how this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m35s)

[being done](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m38s)

[I could probably just do this in one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m43s)

[shot though](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m46s)

[that might be easier](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m51s)

[since primary and second it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m57s)

[and actually we should rename this to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m57s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h55m59s)

[soonish](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m02s)

[um this guy let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m04s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m08s)

[let's go back I don't know why I added](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m10s)

[that obsolete one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m12s)

[and did it so dumb like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m14s)

[um let's change that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m18s)

[uh uh I don't want it called obsolete I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m21s)

[want to call obsolete brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m24s)

[I wanted to be clear what's in it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m29s)

[you aren't getting like obsolete themes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m32s)

[or anything like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m34s)

[uh okay so we're gonna go like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m37s)

[I think we're I think we're gonna do a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m40s)

[couple things I'm gonna pull you out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m42s)

[that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m46s)

[now I'm going to just whack all of this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m49s)

[you all go away okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m52s)

[there's that one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m55s)

[and then I want to grab the secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m57s)

[ones as well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h56m59s)

[these are the ones that existed prior so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m01s)

[anybody who was using these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m03s)

[they should already be familiar with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m06s)

[these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m09s)

[okay so those go there those go there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m13s)

[how](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m20s)

[how is it populating with a color here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m25s)

[how do it know a color](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m28s)

[a little confused I was how it was able](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m38s)

[to do that but okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m40s)

[okay you don't have a app.xaml in here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m43s)

[I don't know how you're resolving](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m48s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m53s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m54s)

[I've already got a targets file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h57m57s)

[thought about that thought about that we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m00s)

[may need that later we may need that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m02s)

[later okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m03s)

[we put these here and what I would like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m08s)

[to do is I want my code generation to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m10s)

[inject rather than putting the obsolete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m13s)

[brushes alongside the dark and light](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m15s)

[like it did here I wanted to do this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m18s)

[mess](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m21s)

[in the other file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m22s)

[I think is what we want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m26s)

[yeah I think that's what we want to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m37s)

[I'm just trying to decide the best way](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m43s)

[to go through and do it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m51s)

[because this isn't a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m52s)

[let's let's do I I well okay so here I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h58m57s)

[think what we should do is we should](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m00s)

[bring](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m01s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m02s)

[paste now there's a dirty trick that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m07s)

[happening in this resource gen one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m10s)

[I've got this little guy here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m12s)

[so any xaml file in this project isn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m15s)

[treated normally it's treated as a none](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m18s)

[which means do nothing with it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m20s)

[uh yeah files that have should have no](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m22s)

[role in the build process](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m25s)

[and instead we just copy it to the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m27s)

[output Arc and The Preserve newest is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m28s)

[the copy of newer](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m31s)

[just means that I can now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m36s)

[read this guy in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m40s)

[and then I think what we can do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m43s)

[because I think I'm just going to go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m46s)

[I'm going to do that I mean I could get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m51s)

[fancy with like X document but really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m53s)

[you don't need it to be complicated does](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m56s)

[not need to be complicated](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=00h59m58s)

[um what I do need to do though](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m01s)

[to push you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m05s)

[because I need to grab](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m08s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m11s)

[I would like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m14s)

[that to be added as well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m16s)

[stop treating it like a real resource](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m22s)

[dictionary you're fine](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m24s)

[um and then I would like to grab](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m27s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m32s)

[and I'd like to go here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m35s)

[and paste that for the moment](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m39s)

[I think what we're going to do is this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m43s)

[maneuver](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m45s)

[East](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m49s)

[that gets the key in there and then we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m55s)

[want to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h00m58s)

[this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m03s)

[just do a search and replace becomes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m05s)

[resource key equals](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m08s)

[quote](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m12s)

[yeah I'm just gonna do this by hand it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m15s)

[not it's not worth the regex](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m19s)

[I get two carried away sometimes doing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m22s)

[Rejects and stuff one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m23s)

[Brute Force when there's only what six](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m26s)

[or I can't count eight items](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m29s)

[accounting's hard](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m32s)

[uh okay so we're gonna go there there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m34s)

[there there there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m37s)

[okay so that's gonna go like that that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m44s)

[going to go like that this will forward](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m47s)

[okay because what I want to do is Gen](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m49s)

[all these dictionaries](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m51s)

[bring in the obsolete brushes one and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m55s)

[make sure the app still works that's the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h01m58s)

[goal](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m00s)

[that is the goal uh okay so that's gonna](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m01s)

[go there that's gonna go there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m04s)

[I want to bring you in no I just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m07s)

[give me your file name that's all I want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m11s)

[thank you shut up go away uh okay and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m12s)

[uh let's make a second method](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m18s)

[something about](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m22s)

[uh generate](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m24s)

[about obsolete brush](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m27s)

[and this is gonna be brushes repo root](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m38s)

[there something like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m43s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m45s)

[we're actually going to end up doing a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m47s)

[bunch of similar stuff so we're just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m49s)

[going to copy this guy and then tweak it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m50s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m53s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m55s)

[grab you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h02m57s)

[haste and we don't need](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m00s)

[I don't need this weird syntax here with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m03s)

[the nested bits because we're not going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m05s)

[to share anything we're generating one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m07s)

[file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m09s)

[okay uh Step One open file](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m10s)

[this guy is going to go here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m15s)

[this guy goes here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m18s)

[and this becomes that guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m20s)

[okay are you seriously gonna try to auto](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m25s)

[complete this for me](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m28s)

[no that's way wrong](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m32s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m34s)

[uh um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m36s)

[for reference this this syntax here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m39s)

[um that you're seeing with these triple](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m43s)

[uh quotes this was the new uh c-sharp 11](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m45s)

[string what do they call it string](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m48s)

[literals multi-line string literals](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m51s)

[uh hear strings is how they're referred](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m55s)

[to in a lot of other languages](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h03m57s)

[but they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m00s)

[uh the the key thing here is you put in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m01s)

[three or more quotes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m04s)

[and then everything between them is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m07s)

[taken as a literal string very similar](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m10s)

[to when you did the the at side at the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m11s)

[beginning the big difference is these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m14s)

[closing quotes here Define an indent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m16s)

[level](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m18s)

[so all of this white space that's off to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m19s)

[the left gets trimmed off](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m22s)

[so the compiler knows based upon the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m24s)

[presence of these three guys here where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m26s)

[uh how much white space should be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m29s)

[trimmed off and if you do something like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m31s)

[this where you back it up before it you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m33s)

[end up with a compiler because the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m35s)

[compiler goes uh I can't trim off](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m36s)

[negative amounts of white space](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m39s)

[so very very click and slick and clever](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m41s)

[and you can actually do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m45s)

[um fancy things like this where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m47s)

[um like especially when in WPF if you're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m50s)

[dealing with curly braces for markup](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m54s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m55s)

[if you still want to do interpolation if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m57s)

[you have a single dollar sign which is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h04m59s)

[dollar signs meaningless we're just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m01s)

[going to whack it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m02s)

[um if you want to do interpolation a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m04s)

[single dollar sign would tell it that uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m06s)

[single curly braces are things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m10s)

[but if you want to be able to escape](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m13s)

[them you can just start adding dollar](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m14s)

[signs right and the key thing is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m16s)

[number of dollar signs in front of it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m19s)

[tells it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m21s)

[um how many curly braces represent](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m23s)

[string interpolation so if you're doing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m24s)

[things like Json as well this makes for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m26s)

[a nice easy way of doing it and yes it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m28s)

[one or more so you can do 12 of them if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m31s)

[you want don't no one will want to read](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m35s)

[your code that is bad if you get more](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m37s)

[than three or four you've probably gone](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m39s)

[off the deep end and you're off in the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m41s)

[weed somewhere and you should have a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m43s)

[really good justification for it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m44s)

[so far my usage is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m46s)

[I don't know if I've gone past two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m50s)

[it's rare I I could see there's there's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m54s)

[a couple syntaxes where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m56s)

[um I know that there's like templating](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h05m59s)

[language like uh mustache where I've](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m01s)

[seen them use the double curly braces so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m03s)

[I could see if maybe you're building a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m05s)

[string for a templating language you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m07s)

[might need a few extra like I don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m09s)

[doubt there's some cases like that but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m11s)

[again if you get past three or four you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m13s)

[better have a pretty good explanation as](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m15s)

[to why you're doing that Beyond just try](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m16s)

[to like draw Emojis with your your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m18s)

[coding syntax](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m20s)

[which is no less cool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m22s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m25s)

[so all of this all of this we want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m27s)

[this is what we're going to write but I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m31s)

[think what we are missing so one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m34s)

[uh we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m38s)

[uh reader](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m41s)

[uh we don't want to read any of that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m44s)

[garbage](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m46s)

[we just want to grab the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m48s)

[the one that's going to be copied to our](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m52s)

[output directory so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m54s)

[that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m55s)

[we don't need interpolation here so that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m57s)

[dollar sign goes away](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h06m58s)

[okay and then we are gonna end up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m01s)

[clearing some of this stuff so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m03s)

[uh string](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m07s)

[existing it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m10s)

[reader dot our](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m13s)

[maybe we should wait to do the reader](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m15s)

[until the very end](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m17s)

[so I'm thinking what we might do is we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m18s)

[might just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m20s)

[do a string Builder and then dump it in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m21s)

[at the very end](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m24s)

[let's move this down that way we don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m26s)

[accidentally use it before it's time uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m28s)

[how about uh string Builder](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m31s)

[of brushes gets new](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m35s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m38s)

[uh oh uh uh how about output](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m40s)

[because brushes is being used all over](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m44s)

[the place okay so we have this Bright](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m47s)

[brush thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m49s)

[local function to find here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m53s)

[frame Builder](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h07m59s)

[and line](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m01s)

[oh love love it love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m04s)

[do that oh yes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m11s)

[tell the code you are on point tonight](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m16s)

[you win a cookie](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m21s)

[okay so I don't think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m23s)

[really what we want is this for Loop not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m28s)

[the other one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m31s)

[because this is the one that's going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m35s)

[through the obsolete ones](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m37s)

[name values value I don't know if we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m40s)

[even care about value](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m44s)

[because value is being used](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m45s)

[and now I gotta go back and look I have](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m48s)

[a feeling of the copy and paste there is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m50s)

[value actually being used no](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m51s)

[that's just dumb](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h08m54s)

[that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m00s)

[okay so we don't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m02s)

[we just want this we just want this and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m03s)

[we want this to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m05s)

[output](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m08s)

[I want you to be oh I missed it thank](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m10s)

[you in line](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m12s)

[we can get rid of all of this garbage](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m14s)

[Okay so we've got a string Builder with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m18s)

[a bunch of lines in it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m22s)

[some indented indented strings](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m23s)

[okay so we're going to do reader](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m26s)

[uh reader](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m33s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m34s)

[what oh it's because I called it Reader](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m38s)

[and still left it declared stream writer](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m40s)

[that will not read](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m43s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m45s)

[uh read end we're not in an async method](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m48s)

[I don't feel like making it async yada](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m51s)

[yada](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m53s)

[actually I guess we could make it async](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m55s)

[thinking thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m57s)

[thinking thinking thinking nah I'm not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h09m59s)

[gonna worry about it Council app uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m01s)

[string](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m04s)

[listing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m05s)

[scary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m07s)

[uh regex replace oh we could do the new](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m11s)

[regex](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m14s)

[let's do the new regex this will be a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m16s)

[cool time to show it off okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m23s)

[uh yes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m29s)

[uh let's see it is private](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m34s)

[regex uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m39s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m42s)

[uh template place](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m44s)

[Rejects](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m47s)

[that trying to remember the magical](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m51s)

[syntax](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h10m56s)

[uh so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m08s)

[oh I can't remember how I hang on yeah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m10s)

[we're gonna go look this up because I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m13s)

[can't remember it uh C sharp 11 or no](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m14s)

[it's not C sharp 11 Net 7 projects](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m18s)

[generator](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m21s)

[uh this guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m23s)

[who cares there's a link](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m31s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m33s)

[regex performance improvements](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m36s)

[vectorization this isn't it I'm looking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m38s)

[for the attribute](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m40s)

[show me your generated attributes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m42s)

[this is details this is too low a detail](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m45s)

[uh that's nice](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m52s)

[short version they made regex faster](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h11m58s)

[this is awesome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m01s)

[like some of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m03s)

[performance benchmarks are ridiculous](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m05s)

[like a couple orders of magnitude level](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m07s)

[different like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m10s)

[yeah Source generator this thingy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m13s)

[this thingy I'm trying to remember the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m16s)

[magical](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m18s)

[that's right private static partial okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m19s)

[got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m23s)

[uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m27s)

[uh template](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m30s)

[Place Bridge X](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m33s)

[okay and the red Jacks that I would like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m35s)

[it to match](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m39s)

[oh this needs to be a partial class](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m42s)

[because this is going to trigger a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m45s)

[source generator to implement this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m47s)

[method in a partial for us](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m49s)

[and the regex that it generates oh heck](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m52s)

[I'll just show you here in a second](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m55s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m56s)

[I will just show it in a minute so this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h12m58s)

[is the thing we want to hunt](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m00s)

[let's go here and slap that in nope](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m02s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m05s)

[many times okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m07s)

[yeah okay so let's go and look at if we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m12s)

[go dependencies analyzers](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m14s)

[let's see Json regular expression](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m18s)

[generator this guy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m21s)

[okay so we don't care about that one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m32s)

[uh this guy here regular expression](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m33s)

[generator so first thing to call out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m37s)

[it's using the new uh file scope types](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m39s)

[which is cool uh where is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m42s)

[uh template replace regex so this is our](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m46s)

[guy here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m49s)

[you'll note this is the pattern and it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m53s)

[goes through and rather than parsing the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m56s)

[regular expression at runtime so parsing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h13m59s)

[this string converting it into a regex](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m01s)

[so that it can do the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m06s)

[I believe the term is finite state](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m07s)

[automata](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m09s)

[FSA so when it's walking through the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m10s)

[string how it's doing the matching](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m14s)

[rather than doing that parsing at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m16s)

[runtime the generator generates out a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m18s)

[method that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m22s)

[simply returns it back now where is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m24s)

[partial on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m26s)

[should be a partial on brushes ah here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m28s)

[so this guy this method here is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m31s)

[implementation of our of our method and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m34s)

[you'll know this guy here is just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m36s)

[calling into template replace regex](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m38s)

[underscore one dot instance so it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m41s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m44s)

[built up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m47s)

[this little guy here and on the runner](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m48s)

[it's literally this is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m54s)

[um that state machine where it's walking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h14m57s)

[through where it's parsing the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m00s)

[um string one by one so rather than it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m04s)

[trying to do something generic it just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m06s)

[literally generates the method with what](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m08s)

[is needed to do that regex matching](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m10s)

[internally for you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m13s)

[like this is awesome straight up like on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m15s)

[one hand it's cool there's performance](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m18s)

[gains yada yada yada yada that's cool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m20s)

[what's even cooler in my opinion is it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m23s)

[actually gives you uh XML docs for your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m27s)

[regex now this one's kind of boring](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m30s)

[because it's just straight up this but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m32s)

[say there was a pipe in the middle of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m34s)

[this right if we look at the compiled](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m36s)

[thing it now has parsed that and figured](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m39s)

[out oh okay and regex pipe is an ore](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m42s)

[condition let me make a um a nice uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m45s)

[nested bulleted list showing you how](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m50s)

[this is going to be parsed and it does](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m52s)

[the same thing with groupings and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m53s)

[character groups and all that stuff it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m55s)

[that is awesome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m57s)

[right the fact that it's faster and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h15m59s)

[prettier and all that that's bonus](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m01s)

[this because the the the old joke goes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m03s)

[you know you solve a problem with regex](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m07s)

[now you have two problems](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m09s)

[part of the reason why regex gets such a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m11s)

[bad name is because you can do a lot of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m13s)

[really complicated stuff with just a few](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m15s)

[characters that no one can read](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m17s)

[this makes it readable](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m20s)

[this is pretty cool so I love the XML](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m22s)

[dock generation on this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m27s)

[in our case we're literally just doing a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m29s)

[straight up find replace did we need a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m30s)

[regex for this could we have done a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m32s)

[string of place absolutely where is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m33s)

[fun in that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m36s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m39s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m41s)

[so we've read it in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m47s)

[uh we want the template](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h16m48s)

[that's the goal](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h25m12s)

[because I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h25m18s)

[that will be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h25m23s)

[the desired end State the other thing is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h25m25s)

[so I like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m06s)

[the resource dictionary setup that we've](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m09s)

[got going on here actually maybe we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m12s)

[should do the rename first](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m13s)

[kill the word accent off](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m15s)

[that's probably a good idea](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m20s)

[um let's go here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h27m25s)

[better](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h28m48s)

[I think we can do a lot better so we're](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h28m48s)

[going to ignore that for the moment](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h28m50s)

[uh uh rename](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h30m57s)

[accent Okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h30m59s)

[is repeat the find](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m07s)

[and I want to hunt all instances because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m10s)

[I don't want to I don't want to replace](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m13s)

[brushes here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m15s)

[but what I would like to do is find](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m17s)

[styles](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m21s)

[that have the word accent in them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m23s)

[and start changing them we'll deal with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m27s)

[some demo app stuff in a minute but I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m30s)

[more interested in chasing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m33s)

[I don't think I want to change these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m51s)

[these can die later](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h31m53s)

[style](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h33m52s)

[uh with the same key](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h33m55s)

[migration path](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m26s)

[right so that handles one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m29s)

[uh what are you doing the wrong thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m32s)

[uh see and I want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m36s)

[you to go to the bottom and be flagged](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m39s)

[as obsolete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m41s)

[okay then we do the same thing here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m53s)

[we're gonna just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m57s)

[copy this line](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h34m59s)

[down to the bottom](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m02s)

[okay that handles toggle button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m31s)

[and now we're going to do the same thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m34s)

[on all of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m36s)

[raised accent button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m38s)

[set Target type](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m48s)

[I should probably be doing that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m51s)

[confirm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h35m59s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m02s)

[is already set to be removed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m16s)

[no maybe I should keep them together](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m24s)

[that should be flagged as obsolete so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m27s)

[let's go and move](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m29s)

[friends](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m34s)

[been hunting the things to delete as](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m45s)

[long as I leave the comment in place](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m48s)

[it should be easy to easy hunting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m50s)

[we're going to add them all here and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m54s)

[then I'm going to rebase the 5-0 branch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m56s)

[and then promptly go delete them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h36m58s)

[that'll be exciting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h37m00s)

[spent a bunch of time adding them just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h37m03s)

[so that I can delete them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h37m05s)

[based on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h38m03s)

[and you become](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h38m07s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h38m16s)

[delete](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h38m21s)

[I think what I'm going to do is I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h48m47s)

[going to run through the demo app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h48m48s)

[existing people's apps will look like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h48m59s)

[and then I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m01s)

[do the rename of the Styles inside of it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m03s)

[there's a a dream app that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m10s)

[me and a buddy were discussing building](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m13s)

[at some point the idea would be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m15s)

[um an auto updater for libraries because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m19s)

[as the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m22s)

[as the library author especially for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m24s)

[things like this on an upgrade I often](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m27s)

[know exactly the change that people need](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m30s)

[to make inside of their app sometimes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m32s)

[there can be a lot it's just a pain in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m34s)

[the butt to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m36s)

[and the idea would be uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m38s)

[a little app that could run alongside](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m41s)

[uh when you do a nuget restore](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m47s)

[um and Library authors could effectively](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m51s)

[uh have patches that would go along with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m53s)

[their nuget packages](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m56s)

[so that when you installed an update](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h49m58s)

[this additional tool could look at the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m01s)

[upgrade package and then apply](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m03s)

[the appropriate changes to your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m07s)

[repository for you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m09s)

[obviously it would be an extra tool](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m11s)

[you'd basically have to opt into having](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m13s)

[it used because you don't want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m15s)

[install a nuget package then all of a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m17s)

[sudden have a bunch of code get changed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m18s)

[that's that's not really what you want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m19s)

[and obviously Source control is your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m21s)

[friend because](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m24s)

[uh migration packages could only be a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m25s)

[best guess in a lot of cases even with](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m28s)

[Source analyzers and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m30s)

[it's it's going to be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m32s)

[only uh 90 good but a 90 good Solution](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m36s)

[on a migration is probably](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m41s)

[the our our theory is that it would be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m45s)

[worth it to people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m49s)

[some point I I keep toying with the idea](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m50s)

[of building it I've got a private repo](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m53s)

[with a spec that I started to put](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m56s)

[together trying to figure out like how](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m57s)

[would this even work](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h50m59s)

[right because you the tool kind of has](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m01s)

[to know the library version you came](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m03s)

[from the version you're going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m05s)

[it has to have some sort of repository](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m08s)

[or maybe something inside of the nuget](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m11s)

[package so that it knows what the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m13s)

[migration packages look like you might](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m15s)

[want to be able to release the migration](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m17s)

[packages independent of your actual](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m19s)

[nuget](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m21s)

[um so there's all these questions in my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m23s)

[mind about how would you do that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m26s)

[and then more importantly would you want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m35s)

[to allow somebody to offer a migration](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m36s)

[package who wasn't the library off](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m39s)

[right the idea of being able to say well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m42s)

[this is a community migration](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m45s)

[which doesn't sound](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m52s)

[terrible Until you realize that it would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m54s)

[be a tool that effectively would allow](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m57s)

[somebody to execute Replacements on your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h51m59s)

[code base](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m02s)

[which is ripe for abuse](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m03s)

[so my initial thought on that was to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m09s)

[just if there was something that the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m11s)

[there nuget package](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m15s)

[shifts the blame](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m18s)

[um because then it's no longer my tools](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m21s)

[is this okay it's in the nougat package](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m26s)

[which means in order for that to happen](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m28s)

[somebody would have to compromise your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m30s)

[New Year package](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m32s)

[at that point all bets are off anyway](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m34s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m37s)

[that's the end of it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m42s)

[let's see if the demo app works](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m44s)

[and I'm gonna be really shocked if I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m48s)

[didn't break it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m51s)

[specifically around lists I guess we do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m55s)

[cut we don't have to necessarily test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h52m58s)

[all pages](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m00s)

[there's only a handful of them that that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m01s)

[absolutely need to be tested](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m03s)

[toggle buttons button check box](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m05s)

[button loaded](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m12s)

[okay uh Fields is the one with check](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m15s)

[boxes in them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m18s)

[I think they oh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m23s)

[uh check boxes are under toggles](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m29s)

[buttons check boxes Let's Do List box](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m31s)

[next](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m33s)

[the one that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m35s)

[was kicking my butt](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m38s)

[oh is this a read-only one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m42s)

[oh show selection false that would be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m45s)

[why I'm not seeing any selection](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m50s)

[that seems fine](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m53s)

[uh pop-up box we kind of already did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m56s)

[with button but let's actually go click](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h53m59s)

[on one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m02s)

[uh let's see pop-up box](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m04s)

[okay those seem fine radio button](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m08s)

[I think we already checked that with the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m11s)

[toggles but let's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m13s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m16s)

[seems fine](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m19s)

[and toggle button is the last one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m21s)

[which is all these various](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m26s)

[flavors of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m28s)

[toggling](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m30s)

[okay uh that's creepily awesome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m32s)

[that we didn't break any of them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m37s)

[that is really awesome](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m43s)

[uh okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m48s)

[so let's go back here real quick to demo](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m52s)

[app and take a quick Gander at what all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h54m57s)

[needs to be changed inside of there to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m01s)

[make it work](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m02s)

[let's see flattened colors we don't care](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m04s)

[what I am interested in is main demo](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m14s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m21s)

[that is a bad tool tip](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m26s)

[we're gonna fix that straight up anyway](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m30s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m33s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m36s)

[I do also have this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m39s)

[dream of building out a slightly better](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m45s)

[slightly better demo app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m48s)

[the community toolkit and I've seen](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m50s)

[other libraries do this as well where](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m53s)

[rather than showing a page with all of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m54s)

[the controls on there which is nice](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h55m56s)

[um have a page that shows effectively](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m00s)

[one control at a time but then give kind](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m03s)

[of like an edit property kind of like a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m06s)

[properties panel right where you see one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m08s)

[control at a time but then you've got](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m10s)

[all of the things you can tweak on that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m12s)

[control to kind of play around with it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m13s)

[I've been I've been toying with the idea](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m16s)

[of how to go about doing that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m19s)

[um just to try to make it a little bit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m23s)

[cleaner](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m25s)

[uh why are the Styles names chains great](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m27s)

[question so the the accent name is an](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m30s)

[artifact of the old material design spec](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m34s)

[so the newer one is switching from the I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m38s)

[uh to primary secondary and tertiary we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m42s)

[don't have tertiary implemented so in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m45s)

[the 4 8 release](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m48s)

[accent is going to be deprecated now](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m50s)

[it's not being deleted with this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m53s)

[with this PR here I'm still I'm still](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m55s)

[leaving the accent Styles in place](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h56m58s)

[um I am just uh where's a bad example](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m02s)

[bad example](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m06s)

[go down to here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m07s)

[um I'm just creating a secondary one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m09s)

[I'll leave the accent one still there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m11s)

[but forward it onto the secondary one so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m15s)

[with 5x the intent will be to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m18s)

[um delete them but at least this way](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m22s)

[people can](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m24s)

[take it slower rather than trying to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m25s)

[adjust it all at once which is the only](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m27s)

[reason I want to get this one in earlier](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m29s)

[for four eight](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m31s)

[so the short answer to your question is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m33s)

[to match the Google material design](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m36s)

[naming scheme](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m39s)

[that way when people look at their docs](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m44s)

[and they look at these ones the names](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m47s)

[line up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m50s)

[because as much as possible I do try to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m52s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m54s)

[uh wasn't an initially primary secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m57s)

[and change back](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h57m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m01s)

[no it was I think when I took over it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m02s)

[was accent there was a rename of the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m05s)

[brushes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m09s)

[where we started converting brushes over](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m10s)

[to the name secondary but we never](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m13s)

[attacked the the Styles yet](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m22s)

[uh just copy this I do wish](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m26s)

[it'd be really great to be able to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m29s)

[gen like these styles](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m31s)

[like I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m35s)

[I keep having this dream of having a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m36s)

[xaml level Source generator](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m39s)

[and I almost I really really want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m43s)

[build a xaml level Source generator that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m46s)

[can](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m49s)

[effectively run oh thanks for the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m50s)

[followings follow space ninja but I want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m52s)

[a xaml level Source generator](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m55s)

[that processes the xaml files before the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h58m59s)

[xaml compile like you can't use the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m02s)

[c-sharp source generators Because by the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m04s)

[time you get down to the the C sharp](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m06s)

[um compiler the xaml compile is already](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m10s)

[executed so you're too late in the in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m12s)

[the pipeline](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m14s)

[but like things like this where this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m17s)

[string is right for being wrong I would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m19s)

[love to be able to like slap something](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m21s)

[in here that says hey this should be the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m23s)

[name of the reference Style](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m26s)

[that's what I want to put in I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m28s)

[effectively want like an a name of this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m29s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m32s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m34s)

[what I really want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m36s)

[but as far as I'm aware that doesn't](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m40s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m42s)

[and I keep getting tempted to build it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m43s)

[I'm resisting temptation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m46s)

[let's do this I kind of like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m48s)

[some people like nesting the content and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m52s)

[it's just this is so much shorter](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m54s)

[collapse a couple lines](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=01h59m58s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m00s)

[let's see here so this goes to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m04s)

[secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m08s)

[let's see move you up move you up move](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m11s)

[you up I lost my place](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m14s)

[let's collapse buttons buttons are done](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m15s)

[cards](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m18s)

[most of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m19s)

[and I I would also like that's part of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m24s)

[why I would love to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m26s)

[have a migration tool for people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m29s)

[to be able to run because sometimes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m31s)

[these renames you're always balancing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m34s)

[the idea of well how important is it to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m36s)

[rename it versus](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m38s)

[um versus getting functionality out to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m40s)

[people because renames are not easy to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m42s)

[ingest](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m45s)

[like they are not simple](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m47s)

[and they oftentimes cause people a lot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m50s)

[of headache and heartburn](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m52s)

[um and if there's not good motivation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m57s)

[for it sometimes it's better to just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h00m59s)

[leave a semi-port name](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m00s)

[um in this case because I'm about to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m03s)

[the major brush refactor on 5-0 I kind](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m06s)

[of want all of these things to flow](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m09s)

[together](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m10s)

[because there's a concept of a broken](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m12s)

[window syndrome like if you have both](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m13s)

[names in the library somebody who goes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m15s)

[to contribute](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m17s)

[then has to know which one to pick which](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m18s)

[one's the new one which one's the old](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m21s)

[one and broken windows then just kind of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m22s)

[keep multiplying](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m24s)

[whereas if everything is named the same](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m27s)

[and lines up](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m29s)

[it makes it very easy and anything](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m34s)

[that's different stands out like a sore](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m37s)

[thumb](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m40s)

[and is more likely to get fixed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m41s)

[I'm getting really good at typing the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m50s)

[word secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m52s)

[which is good](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m56s)

[also auto code helps Okay so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h01m58s)

[and we put in a lot of these things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m02s)

[but I also think that the name secondary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m07s)

[when the the other one's primary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m11s)

[makes a lot of sense](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m13s)

[there's the dialogues](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m23s)

[uh do I want to try to attack the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m27s)

[commands at the same time I don't really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m30s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m33s)

[I don't think I want to attack those](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m36s)

[are probably because I we're going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m42s)

[change up the theming stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m44s)

[um this one's interesting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m47s)

[that's just display](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m50s)

[it's interesting that we did that and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h02m58s)

[then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h03m00s)

[didn't change it uh for the tooltip](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h03m04s)

[so this is this is a common problem that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m43s)

[uh occurs so so let's let's back up and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m47s)

[and talk about what the problem is that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m50s)

[this aims to solve so you open a pull](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m52s)

[request uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m55s)

[uh oh yeah so if uh in case for people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h16m58s)

[who weren't here before the the brain](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m01s)

[teaser in question that's being](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m04s)

[referenced I'll just drop a link for it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m05s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m11s)

[we'll we'll come back we'll come back to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m14s)

[analyzing here it here in a minute but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m16s)

[here is the repo that I'm starting to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m18s)

[put brain teasers in and the one in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m21s)

[question for tonight](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m23s)

[is this one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m28s)

[but this guy so the idea here is if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m29s)

[you've got a repository](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m32s)

[um and you're doing uh pull requests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m35s)

[build verifications](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m38s)

[if two people submit pull requests at](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m39s)

[the same time the bills kick off they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m42s)

[they run the branches they validate all](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m45s)

[the test pass you're good right so you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m48s)

[get the little green check mark you hit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m51s)

[okay merge merge](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m53s)

[well the problem is is those pull](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m55s)

[request branches ran](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h17m57s)

[um before the other pull request merge](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m00s)

[so the first one that came in that's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m02s)

[fine it's PR build is actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m04s)

[reflective of what that PR would be like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m06s)

[on the branch the problem is if any](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m09s)

[other changes get in in front of you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m11s)

[your PR verification isn't really](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m12s)

[accurate it's probably okay but there's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m15s)

[plenty of instances where it can break](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m18s)

[and typically the workaround for this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m19s)

[there is a setting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m22s)

[that uh and I may not be able to find](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m27s)

[off top of my head there is a setting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m30s)

[that requires](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m32s)

[uh branches be up to date before](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m34s)

[emerging](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m37s)

[I'm trying to remember where it is but](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m39s)

[but effectively it mitigates the problem](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m41s)

[by saying well okay I know we run the CI](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m43s)

[pipeline at the point you open the PR](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m46s)

[but before we're going to let you click](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m48s)

[that merge button what we really want](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m51s)

[you to do is go through and update your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m53s)

[branch rebase merge whatever and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m56s)

[that way it re-triggers the CI that way](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h18m58s)

[you have a valid build that actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m01s)

[indicates that the green check mark does](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m03s)

[align with what it's going to be like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m06s)

[when it merges](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m07s)

[this cool little cue idea somewhat](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m10s)

[solves that problem](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m13s)

[because it if if you know this if you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m15s)

[know that somebody else is going to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m18s)

[merge ahead of you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m19s)

[then you run into the problem of well](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m21s)

[why am I doing my CI build yeah I need](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m24s)

[to do it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m26s)

[but then I'm going to be out of date and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m27s)

[then I'm gonna have to do it again](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m30s)

[and it it ends up just being a waste of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m32s)

[compute power so I would not be](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m35s)

[surprised to find out that GitHub did](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m36s)

[this to try to lower the uh the demand](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m38s)

[on some of the the GitHub action agents](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m42s)

[because let's be be honest there's a lot](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m45s)

[of them running doing a lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m48s)

[especially their free tier is very](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m49s)

[generous](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m52s)

[but this ends up making your branches](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m53s)

[more efficient because one it may be a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m56s)

[hit on their compute power but it also](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h19m58s)

[slows down your development cycle like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m00s)

[if I have to wait for the my CI build to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m02s)

[finish and then somebody merges and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m06s)

[I gotta wait for another one like it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m07s)

[much more efficient to cue those things](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m08s)

[up in order run them once and then merch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m10s)

[all right so this is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m13s)

[this is kind of cool I'm gonna have to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m16s)

[play with this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m18s)

[I don't know if it's overly relevant for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m19s)

[I don't know if it's overly relevant for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m25s)

[the like the material design project](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m28s)

[there's not usually a lot of conflicts](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m30s)

[in the PRS](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m32s)

[there there's also it's also not that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m34s)

[busy like it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m39s)

[yeah you'll you'll note here increase](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m42s)

[velocity for your busiest branches the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m44s)

[thing is if your branch isn't that busy](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m47s)

[and why does their blog](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m51s)

[I want I want to turn on Dark theme for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m55s)

[the blog](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h20m58s)

[anyway okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m00s)

[okay thank you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m02s)

[um rename accent this guy we want to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m04s)

[this guy we want to put in 4 8 and we](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m08s)

[definitely want to label him release](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m10s)

[notes enhancement](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m12s)

[e needs to be in the release notes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m14s)

[create pull request](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m21s)

[and then we're just going to enable auto](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m22s)

[merge so as long as everything passes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m24s)

[we'll be good to go they should all pass](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m28s)

[there should be no issues everyone](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m31s)

[should be happy huzzah](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m33s)

[okay with that brain teaser time](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m36s)

[so uh repo was linked I've done these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m39s)

[brain teasers the last several streams](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m43s)

[um and my intent is to start](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m46s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m48s)

[uh is to start actually putting these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m50s)

[things up uh on this repo where people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m52s)

[where other people can go play with them](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m54s)

[because as fun as it is to just see uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h21m56s)

[uh me do them here I kind of felt like](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m01s)

[this might be a little bit nicer](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m03s)

[especially so people can you know play](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m04s)

[with code type it people like cloning](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m06s)

[codes or cloning and looking at stuff](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m07s)

[the other thing is is I'm planning on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m10s)

[putting out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m13s)

[um short YouTube videos like five](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m14s)

[minutes ish](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m16s)

[um just walking through the brain teaser](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m17s)

[and explaining the problem as well as my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m19s)

[uh my solution to it some of these may](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m23s)

[have more than one solution I'll just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m26s)

[say that there's with code there's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m28s)

[oftentimes more than one way to do](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m30s)

[things some ways are better than others](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m31s)

[uh but like especially some of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m33s)

[things like I know I've got some brain](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m36s)

[teaser City on my other monitor where I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m38s)

[put them out to some colleagues thinking](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m40s)

[there was only one answer and they came](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m43s)

[back with multiple Working Solutions I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m44s)

[went oh okay okay there's more than one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m46s)

[there's more than one right answer so in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m48s)

[this case uh tonight's one is a spot the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m51s)

[bug problem so if we come over here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m54s)

[this is the spot the bug problem](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h22m57s)

[so this value holder class is wrong](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m00s)

[and will throw an exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m07s)

[throw an exception if you used so the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m08s)

[question is what exception is thrown and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m11s)

[why](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m13s)

[and kind of for bonus points how would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m14s)

[you fix it right and it's the how would](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m16s)

[you fix it is always kind of subjective](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m19s)

[because the right fix really depends on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m21s)

[the context of you know how is this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m23s)

[thing used like what is the right fix](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m25s)

[so I'll give it just a moment if people](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m28s)

[for anybody wasn't here at the beginning](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m31s)

[of the stream if you want to take a a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m32s)

[quick Gander at it and take a look I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m34s)

[think Justin Bieber got it uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m36s)

[pretty close to on the mark](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m42s)

[if you don't want any spoilers hit the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m44s)

[pause button real quick](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m46s)

[three](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m47s)

[two](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m48s)

[one okay so uh explanation of the the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m49s)

[problem in the solution so the the first](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m54s)

[thing to note is this values dictionary](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m56s)

[is of type string object](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h23m58s)

[so the and the values that are being put](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m00s)

[into the dictionary here this is a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m04s)

[reference type A String this is an INT](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m07s)

[and this is a date time](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m10s)

[the latter two items are both structs](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m12s)

[um and if we look at the hint](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m17s)

[the hint actually includes uh some unit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m18s)

[tests and actually I'm going to cheat](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m21s)

[well no we're gonna we'll copy it in and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m23s)

[then we'll move forward so if we look if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m25s)

[we drop in some unit tests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m31s)

[what's going to happen is two of these](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m32s)

[unit tests will pass and one of them is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m34s)

[going to throw the exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m37s)

[all right so the question being you can](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m38s)

[see all of these things just call the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m40s)

[Constructor and then call one of the get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m41s)

[methods so the question is which of](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m42s)

[these is likely to throw an exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m45s)

[and if we run the tests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m48s)

[uh where did my test go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h24m57s)

[we are and you doc stay we'll expanded](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m00s)

[out expand it out expand out so get](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m04s)

[number throws an invalid cast exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m05s)

[so the the question to the the first](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m09s)

[part of it is what exception is thrown](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m12s)

[an invalid cast exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m13s)

[um and specifically it calls out unable](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m17s)

[to cast in 32](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m19s)

[uh to type system decimal and so the the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m21s)

[important thing to uh to note here is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m25s)

[that when you type just a uh a raw](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m28s)

[number literal by itself without doing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m30s)

[anything to it it's going to be an it if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m33s)

[you include a decimal point like point](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m36s)

[zero](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m38s)

[um you thou you now get a double and it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m40s)

[doesn't really matter if we if we slap](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m42s)

[the the dot zero on the end of it it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m45s)

[still going to end up being an exception](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m47s)

[uh I'm gonna throw away I'm gonna switch](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m50s)

[here uh on my brain teasers repo there](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m53s)

[is also a Corolla or a corresponding](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m56s)

[solution Branch so if you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h25m58s)

[if you want to see the answer](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m03s)

[and I only get some credit for the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m04s)

[answer because frankly co-pilot tried to](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m06s)

[write most of it for me the little](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m09s)

[cheater](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m12s)

[but so specifically this comment here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m13s)

[about when you go through and do a a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m16s)

[cast like this int here what's actually](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m20s)

[happening because this is of type object](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m24s)

[is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m28s)

[the value has to be unboxed so going](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m29s)

[from uh](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m33s)

[a non-reference type here into a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m36s)

[reference type container is the concept](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m38s)

[of boxing variables in C sharp so this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m41s)

[date time also gets boxed as well the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m44s)

[important thing though is for unboxing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m46s)

[the uh the runtime is going to check](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m50s)

[very specifically to make sure that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m54s)

[where's the unboxing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h26m59s)

[uh it is going to check the object](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m01s)

[instance to make sure that it is a boxed](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m03s)

[value of the given value type](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m05s)

[so when you are unboxing on your way](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m08s)

[back out you have to come out](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m11s)

[basically in the same shape that you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m14s)

[went in even though it may be perfectly](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m16s)

[valid to do uh like a numeric cast from](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m18s)

[one value to another so for example from](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m22s)

[a long to an INT you can do a hard cast](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m24s)

[that way you may get an overflow](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m27s)

[exception if it's a big value but you](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m29s)

[know if it's a negative one or a 42 or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m31s)

[whatever that you can get away with it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m33s)

[but when unboxing you can't just](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m35s)

[straight cast](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m38s)

[that's no longer a um a Cast Operation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m39s)

[it must do an unbox first so oftentimes](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m42s)

[you'll end up seeing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m48s)

[weird stuff like this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m49s)

[right where okay I can get to an INT](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m51s)

[or actually it's](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m55s)

[this is this is fixing it so if we go](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h27m59s)

[here](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m01s)

[this will write so I can come out to an](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m05s)

[INT and then come to a decimal and then](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m07s)

[be fine so if we then run the test](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m09s)

[then it goes green](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m13s)

[and the key part here is this one is not](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m16s)

[the same as a straight cast it's an](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m18s)

[unboxing operation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m23s)

[one of those fun things just to think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m24s)

[about when you see the the type name](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m25s)

[parens it may not always be an explicit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m27s)

[cast operator](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m30s)

[depends on the uh the operand on the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m32s)

[right you could be doing an unboxing](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m34s)

[operation](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m36s)

[so that's the brain teaser for today](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m37s)

[boxing unboxing of types](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m40s)

[uh this one brought to you by a bug that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m43s)

[actually cropped up in a production app](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m47s)

[where it was being shoved into a](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m49s)

[dictionary and then being unboxed as the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m51s)

[wrong type and app went boom](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m53s)

[and then we followed the smoking stack](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h28m56s)

[Trace right to the gun and and fix the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m00s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m02s)

[so the the question of what is the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m02s)

[correct fix obviously depends on context](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m05s)

[how this is being used does this method](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m08s)

[need to bring turn decimal should it](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m10s)

[just be returning an INT](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m13s)

[hard to say hard to say just from this](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m15s)

[little bit of context but any of the I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m17s)

[would accept any fix that makes the unit](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m20s)

[tests go green let's put it that way if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m22s)

[the test goes green the fix is is valid](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m24s)

[because without more context it's hard](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m28s)

[to say what the correct answer is](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m30s)

[maybe the solution is just don't box in](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m33s)

[a dictionary that'd fix it too but again](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m36s)

[context with everything](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m39s)

[okay with that thank you everyone for](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m43s)

[coming and hanging out uh like I said](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m46s)

[I'm gonna just spend a quick moment if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m48s)

[you aren't following me on YouTube the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m50s)

[the brain teaser videos I'm planning on](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m52s)

[starting to get those recorded and](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m54s)

[posted I'm hoping to have the first one](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m55s)

[done](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m58s)

[um before my next stream](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h29m59s)

[um I'm probably gonna record more than](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m01s)

[one but then cue them up so that they](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m02s)

[release like once a week](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m04s)

[and then like I said I've got I think](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m06s)

[probably four or five more brain teasers](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m08s)

[that I want to add into that repo so if](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m10s)

[you find them exciting and interesting](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m12s)

[let me know if you come up with any that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m14s)

[you think would be fun to add feel free](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m17s)

[to uh drop an issue on that repo I'm](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m19s)

[happy to accept pull requests or](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m22s)

[bringing things in just be aware I](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m24s)

[probably won't accept pull requests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m27s)

[wholesale because I have to set up the](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m29s)

[branches appropriately but pull requests](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m31s)

[are welcome I just might end up having](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m33s)

[to move some commits around and that](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m34s)

[kind of thing not a big deal in my](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m36s)

[opinion so just know that your pull](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m38s)

[button clicked but I'll poach your](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m41s)

[commit and do that kind of thing so](https://youtu.be/goPHZo4oyQ8?t=02h30m43s)
