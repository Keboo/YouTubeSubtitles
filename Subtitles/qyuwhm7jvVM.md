[little different than my usual starting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m00s)



[I think the quarantine is getting to me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m04s)



[and for whatever reason I have gone with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m07s)



[yellow hair tonight because why not so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m10s)



[tonight I was planning on starting with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m15s)



[the C sharp 8 Noble reference types pull](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m18s)



[request that we did last time out on the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m20s)



[system command line library but thank](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m22s)



[you Jared I'm glad you think this looks](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m26s)



[better i green screen which you can tell](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m27s)



[because it's not green well yeah so was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m31s)



[planning on starting with that pull](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m36s)



[request I think I'm going to detour a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m37s)



[little bit I believe John Sequoia is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m38s)



[going to join me in a little bit and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m42s)



[we're going to take a crack at the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m45s)



[Rosslyn analyser issue so let me let me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m49s)



[pop over here real quick so this guy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m53s)



[here so inside of system command line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h11m56s)



[the most common problem that we see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m01s)



[people coming up with is they go through](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m05s)



[and create a command and have some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m08s)



[options that get bound into the handler](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m10s)



[but unless you get these names exactly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m12s)



[right the binding just fails and you get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m15s)



[no indication as to why so as a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m18s)



[experiment one thought to combat this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m22s)



[to create a Roslin analyzer that ships](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m26s)



[as part of the nougat and then hopefully](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m29s)



[that helps catch those those problems](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m32s)



[ahead of time and warns people when](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m34s)



[there's an issue so we're gonna see how](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m36s)



[well that works it'll be a little](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m39s)



[interesting because I can see a lot of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m42s)



[cases where it may not be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m44s)



[straightforward for the analyzer to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m46s)



[catch it but at the same time if we can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m48s)



[save at least a few people some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m50s)



[headaches and head scratching confusion](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m53s)



[that would probably be a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m55s)



[good way to start so I am my just stall](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h12m57s)



[for just a minute and see the heck is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m01s)



[going on I I know John and I both](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m04s)



[realized when we were doing this a few](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m06s)



[minutes ago we're like oh shoot we don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m08s)



[have everything installed that we need](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m09s)



[so that was a mistake on our part but I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m11s)



[believe now if I fire this I should have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m15s)



[the work load installed so for anybody](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m21s)



[who hasn't done an analyzer before the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m24s)



[docs page which I'll drop into the chat](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m27s)



[for the analyzers is very good they have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m32s)



[written extensive Docs just drop this in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m35s)



[extensive docs on what you need and the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m43s)



[key thing is from your visual studio](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m45s)



[installer make sure you have the visual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m47s)



[studio extension development workload](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m49s)



[pulled in I mean that's it's like](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m51s)



[building anything else you got to make](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m53s)



[sure you have the right SDKs installed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m55s)



[before you can start and that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m56s)



[basically the kicker here so I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h13m58s)



[that should be all we need to actually](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m02s)



[get off to the races](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m04s)



[and then because then you've got a new](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m07s)



[extensibility project template target](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m10s)



[net standard and if I recall correctly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m14s)



[it'll even generate the whole unit test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m15s)



[boilerplate and everything to go along](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m20s)



[with it so totally that goes smoothly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m22s)



[sorry I got to adjust my OBS here real](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m25s)



[quick because this is not where I was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m27s)



[planning on going dude dude do and I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m31s)



[think looks like it's there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m35s)



[so I may end up just pausing this real](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m40s)



[quick and switching back as soon as I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m43s)



[can get John to get his stuff going so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m46s)



[but while we're waiting on him we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m53s)



[gonna go through and try this so let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h14m56s)



[just go ahead and start](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m00s)



[and for reference I did go back Irie](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m03s)



[synched my master branch up with latest](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m07s)



[master the null ability branch is back a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m08s)



[little bit we may end up having to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m11s)



[rebase we'll see but I did create a new](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m12s)



[analyzer branch right off of master so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m15s)



[that is where I am starting from okay so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m17s)



[project template something something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m23s)



[something something about an analyzer](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m25s)



[come on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m29s)



[I know it's I know it's hard Visual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m31s)



[Studio you can do it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m33s)



[come on and always when I'm already lost](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m36s)



[under visual C sharp extensibility](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m44s)



[choose analyzer with Co fix boo-ki](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m48s)



[extensions](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m55s)



[where is it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h15m59s)



[physics project template new new new new](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m02s)



[new add in empty physics console](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m05s)



[extensions vs SDK](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m12s)



[come on we just went through and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m18s)



[installed and installed it let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m21s)



[here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m24s)



[apparently John has to get his his](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m28s)



[beverage of choice ah let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m30s)



[project template c-sharp item template](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m33s)



[where the heck is this thing it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m36s)



[normally not this hard but it's been a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m39s)



[while since I've done file new project](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m42s)



[on an analyzer normally I'm editing an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m43s)



[existing one - optional code iOS](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m46s)



[bindings library lots of iOS xamarin yep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m50s)



[yep yep okay just to make sure I'm not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h16m54s)



[crazy I'm just gonna double check and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m00s)



[make sure that we did in fact install](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m03s)



[the workload so let's let's just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m05s)



[validate that real quick so modify do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m10s)



[Visual Studio extension development this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m21s)



[that's what I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m28s)



[right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m31s)



[Oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m34s)



[did you not include that by default oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m37s)



[that might be a problem the compiler](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m41s)



[platform I'm pretty sure I need that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m44s)



[okay we're gonna shut this guy down here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m47s)



[real quick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m51s)



[apparently checking the box on the work](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m52s)



[flow may not have given me everything I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m54s)



[just kind of blindly click the button](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m56s)



[really quick thankfully this guy is a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h17m58s)



[smaller one we will see hopefully this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m02s)



[is all we need](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m07s)



[come on go go go go go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m16s)



[that's fun where did that white light](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m23s)



[would come from](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m25s)



[20 you guys left something sitting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m27s)



[around there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m29s)



[okay okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m32s)



[come on finishing up I know might take a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m45s)



[while but I believe in you visual studio](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m48s)



[you can do it okay so back to system](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m50s)



[command line let's try this one more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m55s)



[time this time this time with feeling](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m58s)



[and we will hopefully create ourselves](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h18m59s)



[and you analyze a project that is the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m01s)



[goal okay add new project](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m04s)



[ah why are you dragging Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m14s)



[analyze it with code fix there we go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m19s)



[dotnet standard so when in doubt don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m22s)



[just check the box for the workload make](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m24s)



[sure you actually get the Roslyn bit too](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m25s)



[let's see standalone and code analysis](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m29s)



[tool no we want an analyzer that goes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m31s)



[here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m34s)



[great let's see here that is assuredly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m35s)



[not where we want it we want it to go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m39s)



[underneath source not too deep too deep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m42s)



[Sharper you are very close to being](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m50s)



[uninstalled okay so I think system](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m52s)



[command line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h19m57s)



[the question is now what does this guy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m01s)



[end up getting called really visual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m04s)



[studio what are you doing come on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m07s)



[you are you're making me question](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m11s)



[what you are doing Wow](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m17s)



[Visual Studio is clearly doing something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m21s)



[very intensive why it's not typed in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m23s)



[what I told it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m27s)



[who knows maybe that I'm pretty sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m27s)



[this is not going to get used I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m37s)



[this is an artifact of this I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m40s)



[sure it's going to thank you I do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m42s)



[appreciate it my being quarantined at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m46s)



[home has left me I will say more snarky](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m50s)



[on calls so I have started going around](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m55s)



[and adding to the fun](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m57s)



[most people have just been doing the fun](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h20m59s)



[backgrounds I decided add to the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m01s)



[foreground as well my team actually was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m04s)



[giving me crap one morning for not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m08s)



[combing my hair I had rolled out of bed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m12s)



[and had a an idea of you know what how](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m13s)



[to solve my bug from the day before so I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m17s)



[ran out and started working and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m18s)



[completely spaced it and next day I know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m20s)



[it's time for our call and away we go so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m22s)



[that was fun](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m27s)



[so then naturally I wouldn't put the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m28s)



[hair on I've got the beard in the Hat to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m30s)



[go with it later so I can keep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m32s)



[escalating and I've actually got a large](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m35s)



[box of hats that my wife has](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m37s)



[conveniently given me for just such an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m39s)



[occasion just so that we can have some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m42s)



[fun](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m44s)



[okay so let's see I think we're gonna](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m44s)



[lead with this because John's not around](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m47s)



[to tell me otherwise and we can rename](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m49s)



[it later](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m50s)



[because this is a bit of an experiment](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m53s)



[to see how good of an analyzer we can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m55s)



[actually build right like I want it to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h21m58s)



[be good but I don't think it'll be I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m00s)



[don't think it's gonna be able to catch](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m04s)



[everything okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m05s)



[so key things to note right away so the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m07s)



[project template and I just want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m11s)



[check the CS progr acquit because I yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m12s)



[so even though even though the new](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m15s)



[project dialog showed dotnet framework](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m18s)



[ignore that the the bootstrapping thing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m20s)



[fixes that up for us so this assuredly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m24s)



[all needs to get fixed at some point](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m29s)



[because we probably don't want my name](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m31s)



[in here this should be the actual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m33s)



[package URL stuff and all that jazz hold](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m34s)



[that thought](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m38s)



[John's calling me I'll be right back](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m39s)



[you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h22m48s)



[all right this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m32s)



[that would be ideal so sorry everyone](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m35s)



[this will take just a moment I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m39s)



[hopefully this is as simple as click and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m41s)



[drop otherwise I just drag my screen](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m45s)



[over did you do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m46s)



[bandwidth yes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m48s)



[I must be missing part of this so we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m55s)



[going to bring you over here and I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h25m57s)



[going to do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m00s)



[you want to go ahead and talk real quick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m02s)



[John yeah can someone on this stream](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m03s)



[confirm that they actually hear John](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m07s)



[he's hopefully there I know we've got a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m13s)



[couple people that hopefully will hear](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m17s)



[in chime in yes you are here bull okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m19s)



[we're good now we go okay so we are at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m22s)



[basic file new project obviously a bunch](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m28s)



[of this stuff is going to need to get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m32s)



[changed for the new get packaged II](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m33s)



[stuff that it generated so I'm ignoring](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m35s)



[that for the moment named it system](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m37s)



[command line analyzer due to not knowing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m41s)



[what to call it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m43s)



[so with that human spelled analyzer okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m43s)



[so I've got my first bug and I haven't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m54s)



[gotten anywhere yet okay I will add that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m56s)



[as a rename thing so I'm gonna start](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h26m59s)



[with does it build and go from there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m02s)



[because it looks like it's wanting to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m05s)



[pull in dependencies and all that jazz](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m07s)



[so I briefly looked at the the bug](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m08s)



[write-up that we had right with the the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m12s)



[idea being that we're I think just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m15s)



[looking to detect this simple case right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m18s)



[because obviously there's so many ways](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m20s)



[people can compose these objects I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m21s)



[know if it's like I don't think an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m25s)



[analyzer can reasonably detect all of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m27s)



[them but it should be able to at least](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m29s)



[pick up this simple case right yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m31s)



[some dude gonna play for 30 yeah so this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m34s)



[is where I was going to start heading](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m40s)



[next so good news is it it compiles and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m42s)



[conveniently the resharper spell checker](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m46s)



[informs me the sleeve that you are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m48s)



[correct and I can't spell the word](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m50s)



[analyzer so okay so you had mentioned](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m52s)



[that there was potentially one more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h27m58s)



[extension that I was so that I should be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m00s)



[considering grabbing for this and that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m02s)



[fine I mean I can I can kind of muddle](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m09s)



[my way through this a little bit too](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m11s)



[right like so some of this stuff isn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m12s)



[isn't terrible as far as going through](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m15s)



[and detecting this because for the most](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m17s)



[part if I recall correctly because we've](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m21s)



[got a couple Intelli tech analyzers that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m25s)



[we've built up and run but the the basic](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m26s)



[pattern so and I and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m31s)



[decide what we actually want to pick up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m38s)



[right because when going through and and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m40s)



[looking at this I think we want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m45s)



[analyze the entire tree](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m49s)



[and and and this is where it starts to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m53s)



[get weird right because a lot of times](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m55s)



[you're you're looking at one thing in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m57s)



[isolation and in this case we're not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h28m58s)



[looking at one thing in isolation we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m00s)



[looking to look at more than that right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m02s)



[so for example I do know that the the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m06s)



[method one syntax node action I believe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m12s)



[is the one to do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m17s)



[empty delegate at the moment and then I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m23s)



[believe you just do the what is it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m25s)



[symbol kind and then register up what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m31s)



[what you want to grab so event field](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m36s)



[method etc right let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m39s)



[well property I think is where we want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m52s)



[to start for the assignment right and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m54s)



[then pretty parameters oh yeah so okay I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h29m56s)



[I guess I was gonna start by targeting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m09s)



[handler but I suppose we could target](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m11s)



[this method here is what you're saying](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m13s)



[right is go is hunt down invocations of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m14s)



[command handle or create is that the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m17s)



[thinking think okay so that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m20s)



[method alright and so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m29s)



[uh analyze you want to start with some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m35s)



[time yes and conveniently rather than](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m41s)



[thinking too hard](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m45s)



[they bootstrap everything in for you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m46s)



[which is wonderful so the fun part is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m49s)



[this guy here right is four there's I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m55s)



[think I'm gonna leave their tests in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h30m58s)



[place for the moment because they](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m00s)



[basically you've got your analyzer](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m05s)



[provider and then underneath the hood](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m08s)



[they deal with all of this stuff and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m10s)



[give you these key bits of verified](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m12s)



[diagnostics where you can actually pass](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m14s)



[it nothing to say I don't expect you to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m16s)



[detect anything in this case right we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m20s)



[just gonna collapse this guy up oh yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m25s)



[test method one okay so test method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m28s)



[public void detect man handler with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m36s)



[single](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m44s)



[parameter](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m47s)



[give or take a little bit right let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m50s)



[see I'm just gonna steal some stuff here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m54s)



[real quick because the fun part about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m56s)



[this is the code doesn't even have to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h31m59s)



[compile right because obviously our type](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m00s)



[isn't going to necessarily be there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m05s)



[you probably shouldn't make it actually](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m07s)



[is there I was just thinking there's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m10s)



[command handle or test right where I can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m14s)



[go and steal the some code from oh I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m17s)



[mean I can tell you one time alright I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m20s)



[was just thinking that just coming in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m24s)



[here and stealing one of these might be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m27s)



[an easy place to start right is I want I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m29s)



[don't know pretty much to start with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m34s)



[something like this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m37s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m40s)



[so class type name we're gonna make this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m43s)



[look a little more real program](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h32m46s)



[boom and of course yay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m02s)



[quotation marks that thing is offering](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m07s)



[to keep it for you not like when you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m09s)



[first paste resharper's I hate people oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m11s)



[oh I think you're right I think I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m14s)



[watched that didn't I do it now okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m17s)



[almost makes me want to go back and read](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m21s)



[pace oh and I'm using the wrong escape](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m23s)



[character yeah and then of the helpfully](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m25s)



[of the second quote for you when you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m28s)



[already have one yeah it's like damn now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m31s)



[it stopped helping me just type literal](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m33s)



[okay so that gets me there and the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m37s)



[interest of my own sanity tab tab tab so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m42s)



[something akin to this right and we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m47s)



[expect it to and I think we're just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m50s)



[going to pull this guy back here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m55s)



[I think I'm gonna do a couple different](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h33m59s)



[cases here one of them is you declare oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m02s)



[just a straight-up lambda if you don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m04s)



[define an execute method then you don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m08s)



[know what the parameters are so those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m09s)



[are two different cases that's why I huh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m11s)



[look I'm asking about whether lambda is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m12s)



[a separate case I almost feel like the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m14s)



[first one I want to do is the simple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m16s)



[success case by success I mean it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m18s)



[flagging it just so that I can get that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m22s)



[far and I think the handle the missing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m24s)



[case gets to be a little easier at that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m27s)



[point so I mean that's basically what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m28s)



[we're looking for right is that is about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m37s)



[as simple as we can make it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m39s)



[okay so just blatantly steal some stuff](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m44s)



[we expect this - say again](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m50s)



[copy-pasting is about well I would go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h34m56s)



[steal it from a different project](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m00s)



[because it's only theft if it's not from](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m01s)



[yourself I mean my MIT license allows](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m03s)



[you to copy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m07s)



[okay so there's that there's that and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m13s)



[sure I'm gonna leave this Diagnostics](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m16s)



[here for the moment it's not right but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m19s)



[we haven't actually like I don't know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m21s)



[what our ID is going to be I can guess](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m24s)



[we might spell it correctly though give](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m28s)



[or take a little bit and and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m32s)



[message I guess we can we can kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m38s)



[guess this out a little bit what maybe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m42s)



[something like name two does not match](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m46s)



[parameter name parameter name minty does](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m54s)



[not match option name option in like - -](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h35m59s)



[name](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m04s)



[yeah I don't know how we would do that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m10s)



[message in the case where there was a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m13s)



[bunch of options we'd have to kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m15s)



[guess which one they meant or we take](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m16s)



[maybe our suggestion source thing Andrea](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m18s)



[buse that or maybe you say all of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m21s)



[options right that's that name does not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m27s)



[have a matching parameter among let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m31s)



[see severity probably warning that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m37s)



[probably fine I don't know if I would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m42s)



[say it's worse than that and then we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m44s)



[could count or we could cheat because we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m47s)



[expect this the the squiggly line to end](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m51s)



[up here right I would imagine](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h36m54s)



[Oh excellent](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m00s)



[I like tricks because my trick is run it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m03s)



[and see what the line number is because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m07s)



[I'm always off by one very consistently](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m09s)



[copy paste and MIT likeness code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m17s)



[this code was copy/paste that originally](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m25s)



[front Rosalyn and then I found this way](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m27s)



[to try that Matt and diamond interactive](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m28s)



[I don't know probably by now oh that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m31s)



[fun](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m38s)



[forgot it it hides your window when I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m39s)



[when I maximize our chat well makes for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m41s)



[a nice way for me to visually mute you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m46s)



[if necessary](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m47s)



[okay papers into the chat somehow maybe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m51s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h37m58s)



[should I should I make it pop for you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m00s)



[aha](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m04s)



[poof oh that link so for those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m13s)



[interested parties let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m18s)



[so dotnet interactive markup test file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m22s)



[so what is this thing doing so it gives](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m27s)



[you a way to hear like let me find a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m32s)



[tough that you that will make it a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m35s)



[little even clearer III think I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m37s)



[starting to grok this and this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m39s)



[awesome what you need this is how to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m42s)



[it without it feeling like string](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m49s)



[lunging the whole time so I think the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h38m51s)



[appropriate thing here is raw mode ctrl](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m01s)



[s save come here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m03s)



[because I'm pretty sure I want this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m07s)



[and I need to find the repo and do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m13s)



[another oh we're gonna have to fix this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m18s)



[oh I just well it's not a big deal I I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m26s)



[just noticed the way the template](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m29s)



[generated the project's doesn't match](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m31s)



[the rest of ours it nests and s all of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m33s)



[them underneath and analysers folder so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m37s)



[I will I will have to address that so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m39s)



[even though here they show up nicely](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m44s)



[under an SRC that's not what they are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m45s)



[okay so now I should have new fancy file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m50s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m56s)



[think what we're going to do probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h39m59s)



[just disable that we'll leave it leave](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m02s)



[it as is for now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m04s)



[here you can feel it in you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m08s)



[grab link and drop it in okay so code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m16s)



[c-sharp creates mission parser parse](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m21s)



[so get position markup code out code out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m29s)



[position so there's different overload](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m34s)



[if you want nice you'll get a few](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m38s)



[different examples on it in this file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m44s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m45s)



[that one there the name spam or knowing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m47s)



[that one's not even into the one below](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m53s)



[the names that got it okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h40m55s)



[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m03s)



[interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m05s)



[so markup code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m09s)



[so that the code that we're your](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m16s)



[easy-out barcode that's the code with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m18s)



[all of the you know the markup removed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m21s)



[that's the real code that will actually](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m24s)



[compile when you got it so what I then](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m26s)



[need to do we're just gonna well we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m30s)



[borrowing code let's just continue on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m36s)



[the borrowing path right so down here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m38s)



[ultimately I wanted something kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m41s)



[like this right so come here and I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m43s)



[this to be test and then this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m47s)



[ultimately going to be code right oh and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m49s)



[then I need to mark this guy up with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m52s)



[what I expect yeah so I think this does](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h41m56s)



[come back to the question then where do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m00s)



[we expect these squigglies to go I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m02s)



[right underneath this delegate right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m06s)



[right here just around okay so and this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m12s)



[is where it gets interesting then right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m21s)



[because this is I need to understand](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m23s)



[this magical syntax that they clearly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m26s)



[have documented as](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m29s)



[the position in the file there can be at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m32s)



[most one of these yeah so Jared agrees](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m34s)



[around the parameter let's see a span of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m37s)



[text in the file or many of these that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m41s)



[can be nested so how I think this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m44s)



[what I want right a span of text in the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m51s)



[file annotated with an identifier if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m54s)



[there's only one of them in the code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m57s)



[sample the previous one is fine you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h42m59s)



[you don't need to differentiate on my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m01s)



[name okay many of them but yeah if you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m03s)



[don't need to and so ultimately though I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m12s)



[want to get this in there too right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m18s)



[because this is going to indicate the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m20s)



[position that I'm after the ban that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m21s)



[comes out and that comes in a lot of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m23s)



[start position your name position okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m29s)



[so so that type of thing should match](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m31s)



[the text been for the diagnostic](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m34s)



[produced okay so I think what I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m35s)



[understanding is I want to do something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m40s)



[like and I don't think you need oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m42s)



[really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m48s)



[yeah you know I just I basically just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m49s)



[want to do this yeah right you want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m51s)



[be yeah and then you don't want get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m54s)



[name's bamm-bamm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m56s)



[get span yeah and then this ultimately](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h43m59s)



[actually needs to go up here right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m04s)



[because I want this is going to be our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m07s)



[span now yeah and then no location](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m10s)



[should matters man so this guy here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m15s)



[should end up being something like span](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m18s)



[let's see I think start right because I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m23s)



[guess I'm trying to figure out is start](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m30s)



[the line number because ultimately this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m32s)



[resolution location is looking for line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m34s)



[and column oh yeah which is why I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m36s)



[wondering if I actually do care about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m41s)



[this right so you can get a line I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m42s)



[then gives you the character position in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h44m58s)



[the whole strand right you need I need](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m00s)



[effectively line in column for this guy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m05s)



[which is why I usually just count and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m10s)



[then verify that the the answer I get is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m14s)



[close to my count because very](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m16s)



[consistently I can't count so I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m18s)



[wondering if maybe I'm just get spans](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m23s)



[get position in span perhaps maybe I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m27s)



[just need to call a different overload](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m30s)



[yeah because this is this gives me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m31s)



[cursor position that's what I was kind](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m34s)



[of looking forward to see if there was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m45s)



[just a different overload that I needed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m46s)



[to call yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m48s)



[Oh out lined out column whatever load](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m50s)



[are you get line in column that sounds](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m54s)



[remarkably like exactly what I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h45m59s)



[actually rather on my team just out of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m02s)



[that yesterday well thank you bread they](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m05s)



[could not have been better timing so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m12s)



[let's just flip this guy here get line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m14s)



[in column so now I have different out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m17s)



[parameters that's okay so I assumed code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m19s)



[is still there sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m22s)



[out in line out int column great now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m25s)



[that makes this really easy call them](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m30s)



[line B okay so that gets us there and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m35s)



[normally I would turn on live unit](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m42s)



[testing but I learned the other day that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m45s)



[while streaming and screen sharing and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m48s)



[resharper adding live unit testing to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m53s)



[the mix kind of I've got a nicer machine](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h46m56s)



[now but it's still yeah that pushes the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m01s)



[limits of what it's okay with so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m05s)



[actually I think I'm just gonna cheat](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m08s)



[resharper's runner will be will be just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m10s)



[fine for me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m12s)



[and we'll just go there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m17s)



[right so this should run this should](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m20s)



[fail there is no code create reference](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m23s)



[from file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m27s)



[this is me this is a generated code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m33s)



[hmm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m39s)



[what the heck](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m40s)



[let's see here diagnostic verifier](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m45s)



[create reference from file let me just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m48s)



[see is there I create](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m51s)



[did you have partial code in the first](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h47m57s)



[file that is a good question Jared but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m00s)



[this is not from the file I brought in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m02s)



[this is the diagnostic verifier which](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m04s)



[that is in here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m07s)



[it's part of the generated boilerplate](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m09s)



[that they give you the partial a partial](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m12s)



[file this oh that's a good point](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m15s)



[diagnostic verifier is this thing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m19s)



[supposed to be this is a code fix](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m21s)



[verifier oh wow dai derives from](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m25s)



[diagnostic verifier and this guy to blee](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m31s)



[implemented by test class well that well](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m38s)



[that's fine hold on so where it's my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m42s)



[helper then this guy is the problem](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m44s)



[child](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m48s)



[diagnostic verifier clearly using you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m50s)



[don't like your namespace we'll fix that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m54s)



[in a minute oh I wonder if that's what I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m56s)



[did wrong I probably changed some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h48m59s)



[namespaces and you didn't change](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m01s)



[everything let me just fix those real](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m03s)



[quick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m05s)



[Hey Sharper fix everything in the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m07s)



[project when they were fast](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m12s)



[I'll probably clean this up I don't know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m17s)



[if we care about that markup test file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m19s)



[bit what name space that's in but this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m21s)



[is about to blow that away](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m25s)



[okay save all let's try this one more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m30s)



[time and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m35s)



[pile](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m38s)



[I will say the these analyzers actually](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m40s)



[we figured out running them outside of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m44s)



[Visual Studio is actually quite powerful](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m48s)



[we we use them when we're teaching our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m50s)



[class we've got a bunch of analyzers](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m53s)



[that we just manually kick off and run I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m56s)



[do love how my ear count is going down](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h49m58s)



[my direction up down up nope nope](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m04s)



[okay you are clearly still building I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m09s)



[think my heir list has just lost its](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m11s)



[mind I think my heir list has just lost](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m14s)



[its mind okay so that is missing there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m18s)



[why why is the generated stuff having](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m22s)



[is inaccessible due to its protection](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m30s)



[level](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m31s)



[I am very confused](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m36s)



[and don't understand it's like there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m40s)



[an issue with the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m44s)



[generated project template](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m49s)



[don't really want to spend time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m52s)



[debugging it at the moment](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h50m54s)



[I will probably go through and do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m00s)



[later and potentially file bugs](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m03s)



[whenever I figure out where that should](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m05s)



[be yeah so it was a partial partial claw](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m07s)



[so that was that was the first set of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m11s)



[airs is a partial class where the method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m14s)



[it's trying to call us just flat-out not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m16s)



[there and I'm right I was gonna shit I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m18s)



[was gonna check it to usage here in a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m20s)



[minute and see sorry I say that one more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m22s)



[time go here partial is grayed out so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m28s)



[that hack set if that means the partial](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m35s)



[pops the other other part of the partial](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m40s)



[path is emitting possibly theirs so I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m42s)



[would explain the access problem partial](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m49s)



[would be the pride that would be call](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m51s)



['evil if the two parts of the puzzle box](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m52s)



[was no problem well but the the part](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m54s)



[that interests me on that though is is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m56s)



[these ones here are coming from a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h51m58s)



[different class oh right so this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m01s)



[coming from code Vicks fixed verifier is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m05s)



[trying to call into this and can't I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m08s)



[it feels like somebody did a refactor](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m11s)



[and and like only half of the things got](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m13s)



[modified maybe I mean I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m18s)



[turn all these helper things public](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m22s)



[because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m24s)



[I'm a little less concerned about it at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m26s)



[the moment and then come back let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m28s)



[here don't care about that there is some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m33s)



[interesting dragon fruity stuff that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m40s)



[apparently we have framework version](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m42s)



[issues and command line benchmarks I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m45s)



[know how I fix those problems though oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m49s)



[let's see it's very it's a very simple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m54s)



[fix](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h52m58s)



[unload project look the ears go away I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m00s)



[that's a good question](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m06s)



[the benchmarks were squawking about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m08s)



[target framework on dragon fruit so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m11s)



[again check in one eye okay so that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m13s)



[fixes those errors](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m19s)



[so glad that the first one compiled okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m21s)



[why does that other one keep flashing me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m25s)



[it's like there's one more it's the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m26s)



[design time build that's doing it yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m28s)



[command light](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m31s)



[I think it's getting confused there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m35s)



[your startup project stop trying to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m38s)



[design time builds](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m40s)



[ok so these are the ones that are still](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m43s)



[broken](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m45s)



[let's see here so the question is where](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m48s)



[are these guys actually getting used so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m52s)



[core libera](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h53m56s)



[create projects so this is actually just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m04s)



[generating out metadata references](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m07s)



[but is that create reference from file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m14s)



[create reference from file I mean okay I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m16s)



[have private static actually you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m21s)



[what I should do real quick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m26s)



[we let me pull up the Intel attack](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m29s)



[analyzers because we have ones that are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m32s)



[working and I'm wondering if I can just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m36s)



[steal those because that seems like the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m38s)



[easiest way to do it the one thing that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m44s)



[we did on our analyzers that I thought](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m47s)



[was rather fun is we run integration](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m48s)



[tests where we run our analyzers against](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m51s)



[our analyzers repo because nothing will](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m53s)



[go wrong with that plan so I'm in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h54m58s)



[diagnostic verify your helper oh so okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m01s)



[so it's metadata reference create from](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m09s)



[file oh that's a whole lot easier than](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m12s)



[what I was going to do so actually some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m15s)



[brilliant person showed me at one point](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m22s)



[an inlining trick that I vaguely recall](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m27s)



[being totally awesome metadata the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m31s)



[hardware that's all](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m40s)



[[Music]](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m42s)



[and so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h55m50s)



[right and then something about click the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m00s)



[button and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m02s)



[magical refactor in line in line make it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m07s)



[be so you wonderful please compile](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m16s)



[you haven't even gotten to the fun part](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m25s)



[yet note to self next time do the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m27s)



[boilerplate first yeah and I will say](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m29s)



[the the documentation for doing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m37s)



[analyzers is quite good it is probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m39s)



[some of the most detailed documentation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m42s)



[I have looked at system command line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m45s)



[i Jared Jared is enjoying it insure that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m51s)



[restore has included a net standard in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m55s)



[the target what the heck I promise I was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h56m57s)



[working in this solution last week if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m03s)



[you've done a command line or star and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m07s)



[did you do the disable arcade to sit up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m09s)



[arcade that's a good question look in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m13s)



[order to have a build where you did it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m18s)



[one way and well I did so I did just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m20s)



[bounce from my null ability branch on to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m23s)



[the master so potentially problems there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m27s)



[looking for things under the artifact](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m36s)



[folder then what that means the arcade](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m38s)



[building which is usually perfectly fine](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m41s)



[yeah and it's the fact that it's the may](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m45s)



[like that it's package dependency](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m49s)



[resolution leads them to believe that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m51s)



[you are onto something I should probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m54s)



[not put you directly underneath me you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m56s)



[can just do it come in if you do a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m58s)



[command line in the store see the run](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h57m59s)



[restored CMD and that should I should](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m01s)



[grab things but I don't know it the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m05s)



[visual studio billable grab who's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m08s)



[strange](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m10s)



[okay so what you said there's a restorer](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m18s)



[here or just a dotnet restore no the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m23s)



[restorer it's a little command C a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m25s)



[command a command on what I can build](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m34s)



[out the MD just try right now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m37s)



[I'm in PowerShell you don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m44s)



[oh I that shouldn't be a problem right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m53s)



[so I I technically have 3-1 201 I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h58m57s)



[mind having 101 on there but the goal of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m03s)



[the arcade bill system is to make these](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m07s)



[things reproducible so it's going to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m08s)



[download the SDK into the artifacts](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m10s)



[folder or within the Ramon to make sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m11s)



[that you have no burden you know the end](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m14s)



[which I can I can understand that that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m17s)



[makes it that makes it simple ish it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m20s)



[sort of a compilation it's also sort of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m26s)



[it's great when it works and it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m28s)



[horrible when it doesn't yeah well it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m30s)



[not it's not the normal way of doing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m33s)



[things and so and it can violate the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m36s)



[principle of least surprise ambiguous](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m38s)



[project name](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m45s)



[yeah so this is this is interesting it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m52s)



[does lead to the idea that perhaps I am](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=00h59m59s)



[in a weird state yeah I I'm going to try](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m01s)



[the obvious fix and just restart visual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m07s)



[studio](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m09s)



[you might even want to do a you know it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m12s)



[get out of any files that you don't want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m15s)



[to lose fix that fix that rename now and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m16s)



[then do a a get clean with extreme](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m20s)



[prejudice](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m25s)



[I like the idea okay so one one we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m26s)



[just gonna bring these two guys up paced](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m32s)



[and then inside the analyzer folder](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m35s)



[we're gonna whack that let's see you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m38s)



[definitely don't want the tools](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m43s)



[directory because that doesn't work any](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m44s)



[more resources I suppose a fine yeah we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m47s)



[can we can leave those at the moment](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m53s)



[that doesn't bother me test is up here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m55s)



[and then I think don't hate me for this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h00m59s)



[my way of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m03s)



[rename involves vs code oh and so what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m07s)



[is it I did y el ser that's the magical](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m16s)



[now I have to now I have to misspell the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m21s)



[same way I did before which is always](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m23s)



[the hard part let's see ly and then](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m25s)



[yeah yeah sure do it do all the things](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m33s)



[please okay so and that'll get most of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m37s)



[them the one thing it will not do is the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m40s)



[folder pads but theoretically there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m44s)



[only two left](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m51s)



[okay so there's all of that so let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m56s)



[check the really yeah yes everyone who](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h01m59s)



[thinks software developers are great](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m07s)



[they don't this is this is the normal](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m08s)



[the oh man I've messed it up so much I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m10s)



[just got a torch the repo try to spell](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m12s)



[analyzer the nice part about get though](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m20s)



[is when I type oh and my commit messages](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m22s)



[you just force push](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m24s)



[because nothing will go wrong with that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m29s)



[yeah that definitely never goes wrong I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m31s)



[my philosophy is if I wasn't supposed to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m37s)



[be able to force push to that branch I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m39s)



[shouldn't have had permission in the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m41s)



[first place if I have permission I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m42s)



[probably was supposed to do it okay so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m44s)



[now let's see what happens](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m46s)



[that's disconcerting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h02m57s)



[my visual studio shortcut showed a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m00s)



[second one at a very unusual path which](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m03s)



[does not instill confidence in me one of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m08s)



[the more projects failed to load I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m12s)



[gonna go with it might have the word](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m14s)



[analyzer in the name Oh your solution](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m15s)



[files got one extra level of folders in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m19s)



[it right you have to project probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m21s)



[have that yeah well I was gonna say the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m25s)



[so it didn't get the folder names but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m28s)



[it's not going to get the file names of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m30s)



[the CS Praja see there the vyas code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m32s)



[rename should have picked up the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m34s)



[reference inside of the solution but not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m35s)



[the change in both of them why would it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m38s)



[not pick that up didn't you didn't you -](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m42s)



[folders up one level oh yes yes yes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m47s)



[you're right so it would not have gotten](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m50s)



[that yep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h03m52s)



[okay you are you are absolutely correct](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m02s)



[that I'm gonna have to go and change](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m07s)



[that one note to self when doing file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m08s)



[new project type twice spellcheck once I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m12s)



[don't do file new project anymore I just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m18s)



[I always there is wisdom in that let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m20s)



[see here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m30s)



[and this guy here should have so one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m32s)



[we're just gonna get rid of that because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m37s)



[that guy's gone and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m39s)



[get rid of this because that's gone](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m44s)



[gonna get rid of this because that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m47s)



[gone okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m49s)



[rinse repeat have some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h04m54s)



[and actually move](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m01s)



[thinking restoring come on all we want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m20s)



[to see is a compile](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m25s)



[it's not supposed to be this hard right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m28s)



[we happy again well the project's all](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m39s)



[loaded good well no no we're gonna build](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m42s)



[the build the test project if the test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m48s)



[project compiles that will be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m50s)



[significantly further than with go hmm I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m52s)



[can run a compile my world is mostly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h05m57s)



[complete now this should be the easy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m03s)



[part unit test please](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m07s)



[fail if you pass I'm gonna be really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m09s)



[disappointed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m13s)



[okay success we can fail okay expected](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m16s)



[diagnostic to be online zero was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m23s)



[actually online 11 that does not instill](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m25s)



[confidence in this get line and column](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m28s)



[thing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m32s)



[don't know if we unit tough that argue](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m36s)



[no doubt we added this method I do my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m38s)



[work well in theory if you're using it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m42s)



[inside of your unit tests it's tested](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m45s)



[implicitly right that's true](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m48s)



[I'm just picturing if you actually plug](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m56s)



[in so line number something not zero Oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h06m58s)



[column number I am I am not confident in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m03s)



[either of those outputs Oh probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m07s)



[looking for the dollar dollar things I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m10s)



[probably not looking for you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m12s)



[BAM oh that is probably very true what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m13s)



[is it hunting for hold get position get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m17s)



[position and span cursors yeah so get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m21s)



[position and looking for the dollar time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m25s)



[so this doesn't really help well I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m27s)



[so I think it so I agree doesn't help us](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m32s)



[with the spam but I'm not sure we need](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m35s)



[it yet right because right now all I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m36s)



[looking to grab is where this thing is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m39s)



[well you want to get the start and end](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m44s)



[position so it's Quigley's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m47s)



[in the right place](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m48s)



[not to make this pass I only need line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m52s)



[and column where it starts wait no I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h07m56s)



[believe this guy has an overload or](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m00s)



[something that would let it know about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m03s)



[the end right I think something maybe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m05s)



[the diagnostic result occasion have it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m09s)



[nope it literally has path line and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m11s)



[column which so this makes some sense to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m14s)



[me because the air list here it only](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m19s)



[ever knows file path line and column hmm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m23s)



[so this isn't necessarily unit testing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m26s)



[the squiggly it's unit testing the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m30s)



[position of the air in your air list](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m31s)



[yeah got it so let's give this a try](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m33s)



[because that might end up being a little](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m36s)



[at least at least for initial test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m40s)



[okay so give me a line 21 that's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m48s)



[believable number 64 that's another](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m52s)



[believable number okay so now I got](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m53s)



[something that at least looks believable](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h08m58s)



[and yeah you should definitely throw in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m01s)



[a cert fail because I don't expect you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m06s)



[to be there okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m08s)



[so expected diagnostic failure to be on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m11s)



[line 21 was actually on line 11 that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m16s)



[exciting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m19s)



[yeah so it's hunting to to contain](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m22s)



[lowercase letters because that's the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m26s)



[built in scaffolding stuff and ours](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m28s)



[doesn't do that so yeah kind of makes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m31s)



[sense okay so we've got a failing test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m34s)



[let's go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m39s)



[see here so for now we're gonna ignore](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m40s)



[the code fix because I don't know if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m43s)



[we're ever gonna actually have code fix](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m44s)



[for this right like I mean the only](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m47s)



[thing is potentially a rename but I mean](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m49s)



[Arina pretty cool but I'll settle for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m52s)



[I'll settle for a simple targeting thing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m56s)



[for the moment okay so we need to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h09m59s)



[something about these guys here right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m03s)



[and this clearly is the wrong overload](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m07s)



[to call because one my exception didn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m11s)



[get thrown so that's probably a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m16s)



[indication that I did it wrong](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m19s)



[so I don't know what the standard way of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m24s)



[doing this is Wow I am bad at this yes I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m26s)



[am consistently wrong apparently](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m33s)



[analyzes not my friend when we did our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m39s)



[analyzers we actually went through and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m45s)



[Oh apparently live unit testing is on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m47s)



[that would also probably explain my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m50s)



[flashy air list we separated each of our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m52s)



[the symbols into their own methods just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h10m56s)



[for simplicity I don't know if that adds](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m00s)



[overhead or what not but that's what we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m02s)



[did I think what we can do though is we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m05s)



[can probably get rid of this unless](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m08s)



[there's something we want to save for a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m11s)



[reference to look at but I think for the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m14s)



[most part we can probably ignore it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m16s)



[right and so ultimately down here we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m18s)



[looking for context symbol right and I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m22s)



[believe what I learned before is this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m29s)



[here can be sometimes misleading so is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m32s)



[what is it method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m37s)



[all right so something like that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m45s)



[and then the first question is the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m48s)



[easiest thing to check and I believe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m51s)



[named it's probably the easiest check](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m53s)



[first right because in general you want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h11m56s)



[all of these checks in the cheapest to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m02s)



[the most expensive and so I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m04s)



[starting with that or do you want to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m07s)



[name of so we could do name of but that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m13s)



[now means that our analyzer has to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m16s)



[reference our other assembly and this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m18s)



[one of those weird cases where I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m22s)



[the answer is no in general what I would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m24s)



[probably do is move this into a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m26s)



[Constance thing so I don't have to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m28s)



[replicate signatures in multiple places](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m29s)



[but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m31s)



[so if we go back here so we're hunting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m37s)



[before create and I assume we check the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m41s)



[parent type right because now we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m46s)



[going up the food chain](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m49s)



[let's see here what has parent type on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m52s)



[it is defined virtual already associated](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h12m55s)



[symbol constructed from](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m01s)



[reduced from oh boy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m10s)



[see this is where I now have to stop and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m13s)



[think because this is now Roslin's view](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m16s)



[of it not my c-sharp developer view of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m18s)



[it yeah and very much not reflection](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m22s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m24s)



[containing symbol would get me dough](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m27s)



[containing type yeah so I think I do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m30s)



[containing type dot name alright and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m34s)



[ultimately we probably need more but I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m38s)



[think to get the test to pass that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m41s)



[probably sufficient the live unit](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m43s)



[testing wanted reruns will tell you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m45s)



[whether you're getting inside that code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m46s)



[block thinking thinking thinking](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m48s)



[thinking running running running running](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m52s)



[running](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m56s)



[I'm glad it's being intelligent for me I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h13m59s)



[guess I can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m01s)



[it's interesting to me that it's so at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m04s)



[one point in time it hit my if statement](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m07s)



[but apparently it's unsure now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m10s)



[and I'm wondering if it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m17s)



[I wonder if because things are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m22s)



[I wonder if it's just unsure of how to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m28s)



[run this right oh because it doesn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m30s)



[have a strong link between this code and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m35s)



[the well no it does because the the base](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m38s)



[class for the unit test thing news one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m42s)



[of these guys up so it should it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m44s)



[shouldn't it should know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m47s)



[so it's taking longer than my happy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m54s)



[place so can you give a way to tell it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h14m57s)



[to only one the task that you care about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m02s)



[how to get him mom it's looking but it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m06s)



[running the whole time yeah it looks](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m10s)



[like it's running everything I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m13s)



[just new playlists would get me there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m19s)



[and I think actually the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m22s)



[where'd you go where'd you go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m30s)



[I think if you just kick it in the test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m34s)



[Explorer that'll actually kick it in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m36s)



[gear if I'm not mistaken](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m38s)



[let's see analyzer test those go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m40s)



[little surprise this guy is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m48s)



[you pause for a second we'll come back](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m51s)



[to you in a moment](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m53s)



[I suppose I probably should have gone](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m55s)



[through an actually debug I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m57s)



[do I have a compiler is that is that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h15m58s)



[what's causing it to hang nope nope that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m02s)



[guy was able to run okay so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m07s)



[diagnostics none okay so the question](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m12s)



[really is is when we get into here are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m14s)



[we getting what we want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m16s)



[yeah what's let's just do that for the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m17s)



[moment](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m20s)



[show it to me and let's take a look so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m22s)



[the answer is yes and I suppose I a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m27s)



[symbol analysis content program main](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m31s)



[that's not the one I want try again so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m36s)



[yeah I might help in cases like those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m41s)



[breaking it into multiple method if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m42s)



[statement is just the tidy bugger and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m44s)



[the part that I care about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m46s)



[that is true and or see the live unit](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m47s)



[has been yeah well in this case though I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m51s)



[the fact that we only came in here on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m54s)



[the one call yeah I think is an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m56s)



[indication that I am NOT where I want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h16m59s)



[be so this so it's not I don't want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m01s)



[analyze a symbol type of method because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m05s)



[this is the only declaration what I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m08s)



[more interested in is an invocation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m13s)



[which apparently is not what I have here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m17s)



[let's try this again](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m20s)



[vent field label local pointer property](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m23s)



[so these are all declarations for the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m28s)



[symbols and I don't think that's what we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m30s)



[want we don't want a declaration of any](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m34s)



[of these we really want not the symbol](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m36s)



[kind right so this is it's not really a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m41s)



[symbol that we're after leave you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m43s)



[sitting there for a minute I need a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m46s)



[different register code block action](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m49s)



[after some of a method or body of an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m55s)



[expression appearing outside a method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h17m57s)



[body no inside a method body what how do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m00s)



[you get to those register operation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m05s)



[sorry](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m09s)



[you are sitting on top of my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m10s)

[executed the completion of semantic](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m16s)



[analysis of an eye operation with the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m17s)



[appropriate kind](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m20s)



[it'd be sure so that guy which is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m25s)



[guaranteed to have the wrong parameters](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m31s)



[but who cares for the minute operation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m33s)



[kind ah this looks better array creation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m34s)



[I'm looking for maybe invoke or method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m42s)



[invoke or similar yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m45s)



[this looks better because this tracks](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m50s)



[more with like all of the yeah IL](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m52s)



[instructions method method reference](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h18m55s)



[maybe but I don't think that will get us](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m00s)



[inside right that'd probably get us to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m03s)



[the command handle or create I kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m05s)



[want to be in oh yeah I want to look up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m11s)



[to it that is true so maybe maybe we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m13s)



[start there right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m24s)



[operation analysis context](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m26s)



[so rather than symbol I want you to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m29s)



[operation okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m33s)



[which I assume rather than a symbol on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m36s)



[here you probably have something more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m38s)



[akin to look an operation what a shock](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m40s)



[okay so operation is something about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m44s)



[method operation method so one of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m55s)



[things that nice trick here this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h19m59s)



[again the you know the usefulness of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m01s)



[instant code coverage from something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m04s)



[like why the in attempting to make a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m06s)



[switch expression throw all the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m08s)



[different things I think it might be and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m09s)



[see which brands like that well so the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m11s)



[other way I've done it is I've just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m16s)



[debugged and looked at the actual draft](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m17s)



[yeah n crunch kind of workflow yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m19s)



[coverage shows me things are happening](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m27s)



[and then I don't bother impacting the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m29s)



[debugger was pending flower got it so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m31s)



[know that that makes perfect sense so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m33s)



[you would propose magical so how did you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m35s)



[live before c-sharp 8 then poorly or and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m39s)



[Crump has been around a long time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m43s)



[well right but not as you couldn't have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m45s)



[done a switch expression that block a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m47s)



[bunch of blocks all the way through okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m51s)



[so this is going to be then so I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m54s)



[I'm method reference right and one I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h20m58s)



[think so I think resharper actually has](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m04s)



[we live research right here if you click](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m06s)



[on the switch and in both resharper](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m08s)



[quick explaining generate type pattern](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m11s)



[resharper it was there it showed up go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m14s)

[exciting options okay I think select](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m27s)



[none' is definitely where we start I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m32s)



[extremely lazy though yeah you can just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m34s)



[you can just like flap them all in there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m36s)



[let line Unitec thing run well yes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m39s)



[except for depending on the order that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m45s)



[these gets slapped in right because I've](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m46s)



[got inheritance problems because I know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m49s)



[some of these light well the symbol ones](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m52s)



[there there's a an object hierarchy so I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m55s)



[don't know if I necessarily want all of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m57s)



[them but definitely all the ones with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h21m59s)



[reference in them and maybe things with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m00s)



[parameterize stuffy's in them](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m04s)



[I didn't realize there would be this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m11s)



[many possibilities so maybe at this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m12s)



[point it is easier just to be by it but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m14s)



[oh no we started down this path okay so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m17s)



[let's make sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m25s)



[so I'm theory that now lights up now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m32s)



[that it should should go I'm gonna leave](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m35s)



[it there to see what it's actually doing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m38s)



[but okay so it ran and didn't get into](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m40s)



[here it broke Waverly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m44s)



[so this did not get me what I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m47s)



[which means this is probably my my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m52s)



[failure point right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h22m56s)



[we're on method reference right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m03s)



[I'm kind of a pokey pen yeah invocation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m09s)



[that sounds like something that's likely](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m13s)



[to get me somewhere very thank you say](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m16s)



[the next one I was gonna start looking](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m23s)



[for would be call just to see if it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m24s)

[who is who is chugging the most](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m49s)



[well the the offender is Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h23m53s)

[sure I'm not sure how to get this all](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m23s)



[the way in so let's let's see call](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m25s)



[there's nothing there how does one get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m28s)

[just like that one right now that look](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m45s)



[like I was gonna say the the ones inside](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m48s)



[of X unit they like specifically there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m53s)



[that analyzes the equals yeah I think is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h24m58s)



[similar to what we would want invalid is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m02s)

[would that would certainly get us into](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m33s)



[where the equal sign is but that's not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m35s)

[remembering something there is a there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m40s)



[is a tool that will show you the syntax](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m46s)



[tree for a given yes but I now just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m52s)



[remember the word syntax tree and I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h25m58s)



[think yeah this one's Mads I believe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m02s)



[this is the one I've used before because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m08s)



[I'm pretty sure what I can do is point](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m10s)



[this at our unit test and just look at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m12s)



[the syntax tree there yeah and then know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m15s)



[what the heck it is on the thing that I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m19s)

[okay come on here's the thing I was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h26m50s)



[see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m07s)



[you can also have a look at this you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m26s)



[could try them both out okay there and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m28s)



[now let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m34s)



[back in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m36s)



[fun things from John syntax visualize](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m40s)



[instead of Visual Studio haha there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m45s)



[link one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m50s)



[and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h27m54s)

[link to me and I don't know what cool](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m11s)



[okay so not only never okay so where the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m14s)



[where is my new my new toy we just got a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m23s)



[syntax e thingy okay go ahead resharper](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m28s)



[go ahead and and now analyze the whole](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m34s)



[solution I know you want to it's nice](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m36s)



[once you do it but dear heavens while](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m42s)



[you're doing it you lag everything okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m44s)



[so something about syntax](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m47s)



[come on come](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m53s)



[syntax visualizer give me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h28m58s)



[okay now I think yeah see this is the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m02s)



[beautiful part you just go to the code](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m07s)



[that you want and it shows it to you so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m09s)



[I want to go to the command handle our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m12s)



[tip nope try that again command handler](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m15s)



[tests all right and I want to look at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m18s)



[this guy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m22s)



[ish actually want one with a delegate](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m24s)



[with a name on it I get my way](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m28s)



[you got to have one in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m32s)



[execute execute this guy yep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m35s)



[okay syntax analyzer what is that thing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m40s)



[don't think just go thank you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m46s)



[before it jumped as soon as I clicked on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m51s)



[the file it was at the t's first time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m53s)



[for free second under money I wonder if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h29m59s)



[this is giving it yeah so let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m02s)



[you have to make a change Oh apparently](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m09s)



[you have to type to trigger it okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m13s)



[let's trigger it on changes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m15s)



[okay so identifier token emphasized so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m16s)



[oh interesting simple member access](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m25s)



[invocation expression so this whole](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m30s)



[thing is an invocation expression is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m33s)



[that what we want to grab yeah that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m37s)



[going to contain all the other benefits](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m42s)



[of art yeah we're gonna be in there the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m44s)



[argument left yeah so we want to get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m48s)



[ourselves an invocation expression](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m52s)



[okay that that narrows down what I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m57s)



[after so an invocation expression syntax](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h30m59s)



[so then back here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m03s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m06s)



[context okay you were just gonna annoy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m10s)



[me now go away](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m12s)



[register syntax node action right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m14s)



[no no I know the parameters wrong I get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m24s)



[it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m27s)



[this is where it's gonna get interesting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m29s)



[because is it symbol kind no I need](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m31s)



[something in vocational location](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m39s)



[expression so expression if you want a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m44s)



[common good](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m53s)



[say that one more time didn't a kind](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m54s)



[gonna register syntax no an action I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h31m58s)



[think you want to send back](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m01s)



[yes syntax node analysis context](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m11s)



[context node gnosis context and then we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m18s)



[come down here we do all this okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m22s)



[so that gets us close I think okay I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m28s)



[kind of want to just before I get too](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m31s)



[carried away just just I kind of just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m34s)



[want us to see it hit hit hit the test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m37s)



[yeah I should really go delete those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m40s)



[other two tests so I have to keep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m43s)



[looking at them](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m44s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h32m58s)



[keep going thinking okay so context](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m01s)



[containing symbol Wow my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m09s)



[my extension that changes font sizes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m16s)



[apparently doesn't do anything for the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m18s)



[telescope's one so but we can come down](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m22s)



[here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m26s)



[okay so invocation syntax ad option that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m27s)



[is not the right one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m31s)



[next hahahaha](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m32s)



[got it yeah that is what we want so my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m36s)



[node is an invocation expression and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m41s)



[then the question being what would we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m43s)



[want to check on it I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m45s)



[Herot](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m53s)



[trying to decide if that's where I know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m55s)



[I want the expression because ultimately](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m58s)



[I want to look at for this command](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h33m59s)



[handle or create is what I'm after so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m01s)



[let's start let's start with it before I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m04s)



[get too carried away](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m07s)



[so if context dot node is invocation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m08s)



[expression right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m18s)



[I know that it's that and freshmen come](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m23s)



[back yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m26s)



[location and invocation expression is a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m27s)



[member access expression syntax boom and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m37s)



[then let's see here so inside of that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m46s)



[let's see I'm trying to decide where to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m55s)



[look](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h34m57s)



[so then the name could be an easy one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m00s)



[right because we could hunt name for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m03s)



[create so that's it's probably a cheap](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m06s)



[one to check member access](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m09s)



[name and identifier value text](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m15s)



[okay packets that picks that up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m29s)



[and then I would like to check I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m34s)



[think parent is where I want to get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m38s)



[command handler from I think I want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m40s)



[go after the expression again right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m42s)



[and again this this falls apart for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m47s)



[using statics so I'm just kind of going](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m50s)



[to ignore that because that's one of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m52s)



[like we got bit on our analyzers with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m55s)



[multiple things with using static where](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m57s)



[you expect to be able to do thing dot](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h35m58s)



[other thing and using static you no](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m00s)



[longer have the thing dots so you have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m05s)



[to account for it might just flat-out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m06s)



[not be there you can still get it you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m08s)



[just can't get it this way but for now I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m13s)



[don't care](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m15s)



[so remember access expression is i dint](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m16s)



[indent](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m26s)



[it's like you're trying to say that my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m30s)



[spelling sucks well I was trying to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m33s)



[more diplomatic fair let's see I mean I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m36s)



[just wasn't spelling the word I wanted](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m45s)



[to let's see so that gets me into there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m47s)



[and I think once again I just go after](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m51s)



[the identifier parent type](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h36m55s)



[identifier value text command handler](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m03s)



[okay that gets me into there okay are we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m12s)



[so I think what we said before is this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m18s)



[is good enough at least for our current](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m21s)



[analyzer to be close enough](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m22s)



[you should check more than this but this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m25s)



[will get us there so cheater mode f5 to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m27s)



[next breakpoint booyah all the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m31s)



[expressions work right turns out that if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m34s)



[you just type exactly what you see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m37s)



[intrepid gamer so we are working on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m40s)



[building a analyzer for system command](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m42s)



[line so in particular this issue here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m46s)



[from the library basically trying to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m51s)



[build out an analyzer to alleviate](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m55s)



[people's confusion because there's some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h37m58s)



[magical string matching that happens and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m01s)



[it's not always I should say not always](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m03s)



[it's rarely intuitive unless you know it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m04s)



[and John just has them all memorized so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m07s)



[he just goes from memory and is amazing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m09s)



[this one he wants a voice as well](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m11s)



[not people - yeah look investing ISM we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m18s)



[haven't figured out a better way to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m24s)



[that I can agree with okay so now the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m27s)



[question is how do we get inside and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m30s)



[grab this thing right so now that we got](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m33s)



[this thing inside of this we need we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m36s)



[could look at the parent but I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m42s)



[know if that's quite where I want to go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m44s)



[because I think yeah this guy should](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m47s)



[have enough in him so the question is Oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m51s)



[argument list is where we want to go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m53s)



[right name - yeah so inside of here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h38m55s)



[where do I come from so I'm gonna go off](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m03s)



[of the invocation argument list](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m05s)



[arguments I think probably yeah and I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m12s)



[think we kind of want to ultimately](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m16s)



[generate it over them for each argument](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m18s)



[you want to be a bit of matching no so I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m20s)



[don't think so because these are the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m25s)



[arguments to the create method we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m26s)



[haven't gotten to the lambda so yeah so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m29s)



[I think all of our create methods are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m32s)



[only expected to have one right so I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m34s)



[just gonna add one more condition right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m38s)



[so because I don't want to check it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m40s)



[again](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m44s)



[vocation Wow this is this is not my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m46s)



[night let's see argument list how come](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m49s)



[why have something called list that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m54s)



[doesn't have count you know because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h39m56s)



[argument list contains a thing that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m00s)



[contains something with a count okay so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m01s)



[that's fine so now I'm just going to VAR](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m08s)



[argument and I'm just gonna yank that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m11s)



[sucker out because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m14s)



[yeah that is so one of the comments is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m23s)



[that the if statement is growing yeah I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m26s)



[would like to say this isn't how I write](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m33s)



[code normally but there are times where](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m35s)



[you just see I just start stacking I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m37s)



[mean especially when I'm coding while I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m39s)



[didn't continue you know it's really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m41s)



[convenient you know okay so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m44s)



[step we get our argument actually I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m48s)



[gonna do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m52s)



[right so just so that I can have the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m56s)



[argument evaluated so my little trick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h40m59s)



[double curly braces gives you a a Fifi](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m03s)



[il instruction so your break your](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m06s)



[debugger can stop okay so now we have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m08s)



[our argument and now I think is where](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m20s)



[your comment about wanting to iterate](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m22s)



[over the arguments of the argument um](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m24s)



[which is where we well we have the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m28s)



[argument is whatever type it is right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m31s)



[yeah so let's bury down into this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m35s)



[actually I suppose at this point I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m39s)



[should have argument in my locals so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m40s)



[let's let's stop going through the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m44s)



[nesting Skype jerk](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m47s)



[damn I get near my window it closes it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m53s)



[okay so from here we need to figure out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m55s)



[what are you kind that is not helpful](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h41m58s)



[ah so off the expression so sure let's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m08s)



[keep going we'll start a new if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m14s)



[statement argument the expression is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m16s)



[simple lambda expression syntax lambda](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m24s)



[going so once we get inside of there I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m31s)



[wondering if somewhere there's a hard](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m35s)



[limit on the number of expressions that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m36s)



[you could have invited I together that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m38s)



[is a good question I have to believe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m41s)



[somebody's tried it and figured it out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m43s)



[I've seen weird things where people try](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m45s)



[to push the c-sharp co-pilot to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m47s)



[ridiculous limits like that just to see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m49s)



[see where it breaks and usually the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m51s)



[numbers are big enough that the visual](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m53s)



[studio dies on the file itself](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h42m56s)



[let's see so from our expression at this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m00s)



[point I would like to think this guy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m04s)



[probably has something parameter simple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m05s)



[lambda expression syntax why is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m11s)



[parameter single yeah well it's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m13s)



[parameter syntax so maybe it can have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m18s)



[multiple so let's just look right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m21s)



[lambda parameter I suspect](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m25s)



[ah attribute list that's probably what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m28s)



[it is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m32s)



[so the lambda itself I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m33s)



[what there if in my c-sharp brain if the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m37s)



[parens to the left of the lambda if that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m40s)



[is the parameter syntax and yeah well](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m43s)



[your attributes that would be a weird](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m50s)



[way to use the word attribute though](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m52s)



[okay that's pipe yeah and more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h43m56s)



[importantly okay so let's look at this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m02s)



[parameter what is in this identify okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m05s)



[so parameter has an identifier which](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m10s)



[gets me down to exactly what I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m12s)



[right yeah because there's name - so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m14s)



[parameter identifier gets me where I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m18s)



[want to go I'm wondering if maybe a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m20s)



[lambda with multiple parameters isn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m22s)



[this simple lambda expression syntax I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m26s)



[wonder if this is a special case for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m29s)



[single maybe zero and one fall into the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m31s)



[simple and everything else starts to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m34s)



[build up more off-screen there's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m36s)



[oh so this is one without the prayer oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m45s)



[my word this is gonna get ugly Oh time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m48s)



[to copy paper that expression](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m56s)



[hoi hoi Vey okay well one unit test at a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h44m58s)



[time so let's see so this guy here well](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m03s)



[I like nesting my if statements so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m08s)



[lambda parameter we are trying to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m13s)



[deviate some of the magic that the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m20s)



[lambda expression has the command line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m24s)



[so close Raymond this is building up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m26s)



[when you get those squiggles inside a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m30s)



[visual studio a lot of times those come](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m32s)



[from analyzers or the compiler directly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m35s)



[this is us building our own analyzer so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m37s)



[basically in the library we've got](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m40s)



[failure cases that we know about and so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m43s)



[we are trying to catch them and be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m45s)



[helpful so that people using our library](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m47s)



[don't throw tomatoes at us yeah if you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m50s)



[look at the link github issue it shows](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m55s)



[an example of the kind of problem that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m57s)



[the analyzer will try to fly yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h45m59s)



[the github issue above Raymond shows](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m03s)



[kind of the the problem that we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m05s)



[trying to solve the code that we're](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m07s)



[trying to solve is very simple the the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m08s)



[code to solve it is it is clearly not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m11s)



[what are you squawking about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m14s)



[Oh Oh we're turning that on real quick](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m18s)



[sorry one minor thing with the template](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m21s)



[version](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m27s)



[we project I reserve the right to turn](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m32s)



[it up to eight](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m34s)



[I'm going to be shocked and amazed if ya](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m37s)



[edit and continue doesn't tolerate you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m41s)



[changing the language you're not for](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m43s)



[money](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m45s)



[come on I'm not horribly surprised like](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m46s)



[that there there are there are times](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m52s)



[where III understand why you know maybe](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m54s)



[you just can't handle it well yeah sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h46m58s)



[Raymond coming right up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m03s)



[one new link Oh](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m05s)



[or John can beat me to it that works too](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m08s)



[okay so here we are back in our old](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m13s)



[happy friend](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m17s)



[okay so argument expression and back](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m19s)



[into where we were going so we were](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m24s)



[going to check out the parameter dear](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m28s)



[heaven Skype you are you are getting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m30s)



[really obnoxious](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m32s)



[this guy so from the parameter if we get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m38s)



[one we want to just assert on the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m42s)



[identify right I think I think what we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m45s)



[can do is we can actually just do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m52s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h47m54s)



[parameter identifier](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m01s)



[you actually think any other movie no so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m07s)



[my rationale on the parameter being](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m11s)



[Knoll would be the paren friend lambda](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m14s)



[because there wouldn't be a parameter](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m18s)



[there right I don't know that for a fact](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m20s)



[maybe I should leave these off until I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m22s)



[know for sure](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m24s)



[so that was my thought there identifier](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m28s)



[being null would be the throwaway](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m32s)



[character case no that's a good question](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m35s)



[a discard that's the magic we'll do this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m41s)



[for now and see where that leads us](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m44s)



[so I guess if we're gonna assume non no](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m49s)



[all the way through I guess I just pull](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m51s)



[it all the way out right so here's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m54s)



[here's the next one right so string](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m56s)



[parameter name like we can nope not what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h48m59s)



[we were going for parameter identifier](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m05s)



[value text right so we've gotten all the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m09s)



[way down here we got ourselves our value](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m11s)



[to here's the hard part](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m13s)



[how do we know what to compare it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m15s)



[against because ultimately the only way](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m17s)



[we know this is this is if something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m24s)



[else has told us about it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m30s)



[well so the handler attaches to a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m33s)



[command the command attaches to the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m35s)



[options but this is why I was I was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m38s)



[saying if you can explore this with some](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m40s)



[command line and object model it's very](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m43s)



[straightforward you'll find those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m44s)



[objects so we have to do all of this by](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m46s)



[alternative well and more importantly we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m50s)



[don't know so and this is why so part of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m54s)



[me is thinking that this analyser is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m57s)



[only going to be good for constants](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h49m59s)



[right because if if you were to pass in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m03s)



[a variable say heaven forbid you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m06s)



[instantiate a command where it you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m10s)



[you you're pulling in the name of it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m15s)



[from an environment variable or](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m17s)



[something something that's only known at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m18s)



[runtime](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m19s)



[right well the analyzer can't catch](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m20s)



[runtime stuff](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m23s)



[sure but I think for the most part](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m27s)



[that's not gonna be a common case I I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m30s)



[agree and I think that's that was kind](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m32s)



[of my thought of it really needs to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m34s)



[constants that we could likely do right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m37s)



[I think it was the moment somebody](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m40s)



[starts you know passing in a method that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m42s)



[generates their command name at that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m44s)



[point it's like yeah all bets are off at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m45s)



[this point we I haven't but I probably](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m49s)



[should so that there were suggestions to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h50m58s)



[try to solve this problem and at one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m02s)



[time and the reason why we're kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m05s)



[shying away from that is that it's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m08s)



[performative hit that is presumably you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m10s)



[know the code has these things matched](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m14s)



[up correctly or the doublet and once you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m17s)



[build it it's never going to change](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m19s)



[right yeah and I and I sort of agree](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m21s)



[that trying to catch this here is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m23s)



[probably better side side thought that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m25s)



[I'll just throw out their structure map](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m32s)



[the DI container at one point in time](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m36s)



[they had a method on their container](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m39s)



[that was just a cert container is valid](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m42s)



[yeah typically you know effectively you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m44s)



[you do that hit at runtime but you wrap](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m48s)



[it in a nifty bug or whatever right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m50s)



[that you catch it but not always](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m51s)



[okay so I think the only way this works](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m54s)



[then is we need to a so I think we have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h51m57s)



[to make start making some assumptions](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m03s)



[and if we can make the assumption that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m04s)



[this guy is going to be attached to a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m08s)



[command that is declared in the same](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m10s)



[method](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m12s)



[I think we could do that because these](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m13s)



[things are these things just get our](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m17s)



[callbacks while the trees being analyzed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m19s)



[so well the question can we use the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m21s)



[semantic model to go and look up the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m26s)



[thing if it's somewhere else right lady](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m28s)



[options are over here and one a file](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m29s)



[okay](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m31s)



[and a completely different file come](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m32s)



[where is the handler right is there is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m34s)



[there a way to look this up I see what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m40s)



[you're saying okay so the idea being we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m42s)



[want to go backwards and find this and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m45s)



[the question is can we ha ha so we have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m47s)



[so I think we have to go back then to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m53s)



[our node right and start walking](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m55s)



[backwards and from our node we do have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h52m58s)



[this assignment expression syntax so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m05s)



[let's walk up that because that one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m09s)



[ultimately shows that it's command](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m11s)



[handler so from the assignment I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m13s)



[looking for whatever's gonna be on the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m17s)



[left](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m18s)



[look it's called left how convenient](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m19s)



[let's start there let's see it's got an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m23s)



[identifier syntax or identifier name](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m28s)



[syntax and the question being is can I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m33s)



[go from this identifier to finding](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m37s)



[something else about it alright cuz that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m39s)



[would without that would be the kicker](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m43s)



[is if I could go from here and then use](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m44s)



[something to walk I think I think what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m47s)



[you might be able to do can we pop over](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m50s)



[to the immediate window for a second](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m53s)



[sure if you do context dot semantic](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h53m54s)



[model](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m00s)



[mm amti epi that oh well next let's try](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m04s)



[that again yep there we go okay yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m12s)



[symbol symbol pack in that argument](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m18s)



[maybe the argument expression so you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m28s)



[want the thing on the so we want the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m33s)



[thing on the left right E so yeah we do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m36s)



[yeah we want to pass in this well not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m42s)



[command handle our command right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m47s)



[ultimately we want to command so that we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m49s)



[can then go and look at it it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m52s)



[information yeah so that is a great](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h54m55s)



[question let's see where do we get that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m00s)



[from so I had that in my what about sort](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m05s)



[of the entire tree well I so I I sort of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m10s)



[have it here right in that all we can go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m15s)



[straight to the node go up to his parent](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m20s)



[and then down in the parent laughs yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m22s)



[node parent left the problem is I think](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m28s)



[these are all gonna need to be cast](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m31s)



[because this is syntax node which isn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m33s)



[which is going to be needed to catch to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m36s)



[a simple assignment I think I mean we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m38s)



[can we can make this work right so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m42s)



[so the immediate window have a cap](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m46s)



[everything too dynamic that would be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m49s)



[nice](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m53s)



[so let's see so context no dot parent](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h55m55s)



[and we're just going to cast because why](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m00s)



[not right parent we know this is going](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m05s)



[to be an assignment expression syntax](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m07s)



[all right and I ultimately want to just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m11s)



[grab the left guy right and left gets me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m14s)



[to em and dot handler so let's just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m18s)



[keep going remember access expression](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m27s)



[there's no way this is gonna bite me VAR](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m37s)



[ID alright and this will do dot](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m43s)



[expression which will give you the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m49s)



[identifier expression yeah I didn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m51s)



[continue and then we step step step ok](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h56m55s)



[so I should have it so now we go to your](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m00s)



[immediate window and we pass in ID](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m03s)



[so simple local command command so RS](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m11s)



[gets this whole thing right I want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m17s)



[something in the immediate window that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m21s)



[take my last result assigned a variable](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m22s)



[yeah yeah like I want it I want to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m25s)



[the piping model](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m28s)



[okay so s](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m29s)



[okay I don't know what a symbol info has](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m41s)



[but I am tempted to do it like this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m48s)



[right and then just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h57m57s)



[you back up try again so what is now on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m01s)



[this guy's so you give me a symbol and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m10s)



[so now the question is what can I get](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m14s)



[from you right because if I can now walk](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m16s)



[back and get it what is on this symbol](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m20s)



[okay so we know he's contained within](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m28s)



[Maine we know what type he's in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m31s)



[declaring syntax references I don't know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m35s)



[if that's overly helpful it's mostly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m40s)



[just spans and a full syntax tree that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m43s)



[looks like miserable way of processing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m45s)



[it what else we got yeah thank you we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m47s)



[know it's named locally yeah I am](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m52s)



[wondering if we could we want to we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h58m57s)



[understand the semantics but I don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m05s)



[know how much of that is really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m08s)



[expressed in the syntax tree oh this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m12s)



[going to be crazy](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m16s)



[we're gonna have to do it like there's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m17s)



[multiple ways to add the option to the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m18s)



[command and we probably need to go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m20s)



[hunting down all of them here with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m22s)



[knowledge of that object model like add](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m24s)



[add option and consent collection](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m26s)



[initializers they're all going to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m30s)



[different syntax models](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m31s)



[parent the reason for that Raymond](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m37s)



[yeah is because initially what we did is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m43s)



[we we locked into this portion of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m45s)



[syntax tree for the c-sharp compiler so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m49s)



[when you go to the parent you end up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m51s)



[grabbing that so you get the whole line](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m53s)



[which is why the assignment is the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=01h59m56s)



[parent level](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m00s)



[so I'm wondering John if like I think we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m03s)



[could make this work on a simple case](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m10s)



[but I don't know if we're going to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m12s)



[able to do this like I think one of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m14s)



[assumptions you almost have to make](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m18s)



[right out the gate is that we can only](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m20s)



[check it if these are declared in the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m23s)



[same method if we made that assumption](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m25s)



[that drastically simplifies the problem](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m28s)



[right and most women that welcome so can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m31s)



[we now explore from yeah maybe because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m38s)



[if I can make the assumption that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m41s)



[they're in the same method right I can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m42s)



[wire up the enter and exits on this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m46s)



[method right because I know when I enter](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m49s)



[and when I encounter a symbol or an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m51s)



[option and basically keep track of what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m54s)



[I see yeah I feel like there's a way to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h00m58s)



[do that but maybe that anymore](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m02s)



[because wait because what you stood out](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m07s)



[right like we can get ourselves to this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m10s)



[guy here but ultimately that's not quite](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m12s)



[good enough](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m17s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m22s)



[writing code about code to reason about](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m27s)



[code is really hard to code true true](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m30s)



[oh I just realized I missed an](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m44s)



[opportunity tonight's my first night](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m46s)



[streaming with my green screen and I did](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m48s)



[not grab one of the classic Green](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m50s)



[Mountain Dews there is a missed](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m52s)



[opportunity that will be a joke for next](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m55s)



[week looking bored oh yeah cuz because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h01m57s)



[even though because I think the other](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m07s)



[thing that's making this really hard is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m09s)



[the disjoint between the command and the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m11s)



[option right because to know whether](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m13s)



[we're correct or not requires looking at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m16s)



[the option the semantic model lets you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m18s)



[analyze the flow of symbols through](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m30s)



[different methods but I have no idea how](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m33s)



[to do this I just hear I've heard people](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m37s)



[talk about it I think it's something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m39s)



[that can be done](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m40s)



[I can certainly ask somebody who knows a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m46s)



[lot about that stuff excellent I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m48s)



[put you on the hook for that because it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m52s)



[a if it's possible I would I would love](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m54s)



[to know that I am sort of curious cuz](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m56s)



[the one thing that this locals window is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h02m58s)



[really bad at showing is what the so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m01s)



[what it's so sorry is it's really bad at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m08s)



[showing methods that are on here and I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m12s)



[wondering if maybe that would be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m14s)



[revealing - no right so I kind of want](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m16s)



[to look at](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m19s)



[info symbol get tight](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m21s)



[we'll go with initializer](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m30s)



[so if I do that yes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m35s)



[I may not be able to get at that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m47s)



[directly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m48s)



[so I'm curious what might be down on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h03m56s)



[display parts you know displaced rain](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m02s)



[it seems like](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m10s)



[the symbol should have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m13s)



[information](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m16s)



[I definitely need to cast this guy down](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m23s)



[to something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m26s)



[what are you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m28s)



[let's see](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m33s)



[simple search local symbol](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m38s)



[nope turns out still suck at IKEA](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h04m51s)



[some I can get away with that back up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m02s)



[again](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m06s)



[what do you give me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m08s)



[what do you give](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m11s)



[give me any new methods that weren't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m19s)



[already on I symbol that's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m22s)



[you just](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m28s)



[information about the local](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m30s)



[that's not that helpful](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m35s)



[function value is raft is Bradleys](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m40s)



[hair type command](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m50s)



[constructed from I wonder if this is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h05m56s)



[so I wonder if perhaps our contrived](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m04s)



[example as possibly biting us right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m07s)



[because it knows that the type of this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m10s)



[thing syntactically is command but it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m13s)



[has no idea of what command is because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m15s)



[in our unit test it's not like we've got](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m18s)



[a using system command line anywhere nor](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m20s)



[a reference to it yeah that's why I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m22s)



[wondering if we need a compilation to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m26s)



[able to do some of the the analysis that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m29s)



[we need here yeah I mean well I mean we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m32s)



[can bring in system command line into](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m35s)



[this guy how does that work how do you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m37s)



[reference with some command line and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m40s)



[then have it be stable across multiple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m42s)



[versions oh I know the answer to this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m43s)



[question yay finally so on these guys](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m46s)



[here so when you're building these up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m50s)



[because we end up doing this when we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m52s)



[when we're running our analyzers sort of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m54s)



[freehand right so this guy verifies](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m56s)



[c-sharp diagnostic verify c-sharp](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h06m59s)



[diagnostic](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m02s)



[we've this guy to be analyzed or would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m05s)



[look at Birds on Hobbs looking from now](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m10s)



[on right correct so what you can do is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m12s)



[so they under the hood and part of one](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m15s)



[of the big benefits of all of this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m19s)



[boilerplate that they generate is they](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m21s)



[build a project for you on the fly and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m23s)



[then compile it yep](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m28s)



[so ultimately it comes down to this this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m30s)



[magical bit of with analyzers so if you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m33s)



[want to do your own compilation with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m35s)



[analyzers this is all it takes you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m37s)



[my tool just loads up analyzes with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m40s)



[reflection and away you go](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m42s)



[but if we want to go through and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m43s)



[reference system command line we could](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m45s)



[pull it in here right so it's all in the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m47s)



[building up of this project let them add](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m50s)



[stuff into it and so that's all it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m52s)



[should take to do I am curious because I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h07m56s)



[expected to see down into here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m00s)



[those metadata references that we did](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m02s)



[before right right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m04s)



[no definitely not I think I'm coming up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m09s)



[on the witching hour here yeah no and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m14s)



[that's fine so I'm gonna commit what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m18s)



[we've got and and put it at least on my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m21s)



[branch and we can revisit this I would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m23s)



[be very curious if you find out more](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m26s)



[information about it though yeah I'll](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m28s)



[put this problems with it once you push](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m31s)



[it up I have a branch I can show someone](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m33s)



[a sample of what we're trying to do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m34s)



[I can want to answer that question of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m36s)



[what's the general approach we can take](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m38s)



[there in the work here I will I will](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m40s)



[save you the trouble](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m43s)

[boom push](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h08m51s)

[look yeah sweet John well thank you I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m03s)



[apologize for keeping you up so late no](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m09s)



[no yeah oh it's fun to get on in pair so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m11s)



[I like these interesting problems and I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m15s)



[will be very curious to see what what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m17s)



[information you come up with so sweet](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m20s)

[for tea and an honor](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m25s)



[yeah and the stuff we were doing was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m27s)



[fairly fairly benign right like a lot of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m29s)



[it was just in is we needed something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m32s)



[basically fancier than FX cop type rules](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m34s)

[probably take a stab](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h09m55s)

[if it's me brother sir hits in the eye](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m37s)



[it's headless right you don't you don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m39s)



[have any way to know what happens it'll](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m41s)



[believe it was a killer process but you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m43s)



[see they would pop up a message and die](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m45s)



[that frame you know and on that corner I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m46s)



[think it kills the process so you don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m49s)



[can you tap that foot you don't really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m51s)



[know what happened to where it happened](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m53s)



[got it okay I don't know if there's a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m55s)



[trick for that for avoiding that oh yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h10m57s)



[and I don't recall his exact response](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m01s)



[but I think I think the point that he](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m03s)



[had made was that that behavior](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m06s)



[surprised him](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m09s)



[and maybe I need to just go through and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m14s)



[check it and see exactly because because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m16s)



[most of the comets seems fairly simple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m20s)



[and straightforward right of being able](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m22s)



[to do that this was so if I can steal](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m27s)



[you for just a moment longer this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m31s)



[provider value source this comment here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m32s)



[so I agree with him that logic changes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m34s)



[should come with a corresponding test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m37s)



[but I am actually so I went to write](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m39s)



[this test and I can't there's no way to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m42s)



[hit this null case from outside because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m46s)



[this is an internal class so part of me](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m49s)



[is like I don't know what to do right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m52s)



[technically it could be null there is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m55s)



[cases where binding contexts can be null](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m57s)



[but none that I can trigger to get into](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h11m59s)



[this code path so I like so I agree that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m02s)



[yes it should come with a corresponding](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m08s)



[test but I can't get there from here and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m10s)



[I don't know I don't know how we want to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m14s)



[handle it and maybe the answer is we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m16s)



[don't need to handle it for this PR you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m19s)



[should that's sort of my question is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m22s)



[I've got some of those outstanding ones](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m24s)



[and I can leave comments on the PR and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m26s)



[tag you on them where I run into](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m28s)



[questions but I don't know quite how to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m29s)



[handle some of these cases where it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m32s)



[not currently possible with the with the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m35s)



[public API](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m38s)



[yeah I mean it's one of the things of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m41s)



[you know do you want 100% code coverage](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m43s)



[and do you believe that covering like a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m45s)



[null check is interesting enough to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m49s)



[worth the time yeah sometimes I say it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m52s)



[not right I'll have no guards in places](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m55s)



[I'm like I know that no guard works I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h12m57s)



[not that worried about it so then this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m01s)



[sort of takes it one step farther which](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m02s)



[is if the compiler won't let me write](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m04s)



[that task as a unit test so it's now I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m07s)



[testing a null check via an integration](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m09s)



[test that seems up there but like I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m12s)



[understand why the radwan compiler is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m16s)



[tufted with that degree of rigor right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m20s)



[because the rest of us depend on it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m23s)



[being bulletproof yeah yeah but I'm](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m25s)



[kepta cold that's needed everywhere yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m29s)



[so that so because this was from his](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m32s)



[initial review and I I meant to post a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m35s)



[reply back to him and it was late when I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m37s)



[realized that I couldn't do it and I was](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m40s)



[like dang it so and that was just really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m41s)



[just looking to get your feedback on](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m45s)



[what to do and I think the answer here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m47s)



[is going to be not currently possible](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m48s)



[but in general yes if behavioral changes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m50s)



[should come with tests cuz he is correct](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m53s)



[that this is a behavioral change putting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m55s)



[this in](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m57s)



[before it used to blow up now it doesn't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h13m59s)



[blow up though my thought is if it blew](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m01s)



[up before I would have a failing test](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m04s)



[somewhere right like we we don't](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m07s)



[suppress exceptions anywhere so and then](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m12s)



[there was a bunch of stylistic changes](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m15s)



[about is no versus equals equals Nolan I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m17s)



[don't know if you care about those](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m19s)



[generally a good change okay I realized](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m22s)



[it was somewhat beyond what my pull](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m25s)



[request was initially meant to do but I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m28s)



[have been very much pushing this in my](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m29s)



[other repos for those people who are](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m32s)



[unaware is null is roughly the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m34s)



[equivalent of a reference equals you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m37s)



[know whereas equals equals operator can](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m39s)



[be overridden so in the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m42s)



[cases they're going to compile to the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m45s)



[same type of thing except where somebody](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m47s)



[gets crazy and starts to override equals](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m50s)



[and then then you get bit in all kinds](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m52s)



[of fun and exciting ways yeah I've been](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m55s)



[kind of the opinion for years operator](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h14m57s)



[overloading and the existence of the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m00s)



[equals method on the object class](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m03s)



[definition are both mistakes yeah yeah I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m06s)



[can understand that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m13s)



[yeah so okay I think most of the other](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m16s)



[comments were fairly benign and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m20s)



[straightforward as far as what what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m21s)



[needs to go where so I think most of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m24s)



[this should be should be fairly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m29s)



[straightforward there was only a couple](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m32s)



[of weird things that I ended up doing](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m33s)



[like Reda Clarion this variable here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m35s)



[because there was no nice before we were](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m37s)



[reusing the same local variable the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m40s)



[problem is is now I effectively need two](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m43s)



[different variables one that's notable](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m45s)



[and one that's not to make the compiler](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m47s)



[happy can you do something like if not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m51s)



[parent root command in blah other name](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m54s)



[and birthday up and then it leaves the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h15m58s)



[variable in scope so the problem was is](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m01s)



[this this guy here yeah wants to be](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m07s)



[knowable because of the first or default](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m10s)



[which was clearly possible because we](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m12s)



[were checking for null right and so I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m14s)



[needed something knowable but root](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m16s)



[command above here is declared is a](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m18s)



[pattern match output yes this guy and so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m23s)



[you can't do Anila Bowl on the pattern](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m28s)



[match output](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m31s)



[command question mark is invalid here](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m34s)



[because the whole point of the pattern](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m37s)



[match is to verify nominal so I would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m40s)



[have to so I could pull this out declare](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m41s)



[not inaudible this becomes a different](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m44s)



[one and I couldn't I couldn't come up](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m46s)



[with a clean way I was like you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m48s)



[what I'm fighting around this just to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m50s)



[reuse a variable darn I'll declare a new](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m52s)



[people and you don't have a problem so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m53s)



[it only got weird because this local](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m56s)



[gets used one more time below this and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h16m58s)



[so it's like so I separated it that](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m00s)



[double up on them there's what's the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m08s)



[name for that particular lat](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m10s)



[Kevin working around a problem so there](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m19s)



[are a couple weird oddity things that I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m25s)



[did in here so I would say definitely](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m28s)



[look it and give it one more look over I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m31s)



[I like I said I'll go through and](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m33s)



[address the rest of Julian's comments](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m35s)



[cuz again most of them look fairly](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m37s)



[simple and straightforward and benign](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m39s)



[but just wanting to get that feedback](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m41s)



[from you of what's the expectation](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m44s)



[because it would be nice to get this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m46s)



[merged because my next poll request will](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m48s)



[then be knowable reference types on the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m50s)



[other projects](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m52s)



[because this is just the core one it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m54s)



[doesn't expand it out beyond that how do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h17m56s)



[that I haven't spent enough time with](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m00s)



[this particular feature you have to know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m02s)



[some of those ponies details as well if](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m03s)



[you were to do parent root command what](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m05s)



[is it called and equal or you know](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m10s)



[question mark question mark equals](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m13s)



[rather oh right](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m14s)



[new root command does that change the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m16s)



[null ability from that point onward or](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m18s)



[can the null ability of the symbol not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m21s)



[be effectively declared and getting the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m23s)



[latter I so I think it's the latter but](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m27s)



[I honestly don't know for sure I I](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m31s)



[haven't combined those two things](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m33s)



[together yet that might that would clean](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m36s)



[that up a little bit right cuz then you](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m43s)



[wouldn't need it you wouldn't need the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m44s)



[it oh no you do need it I do need the F](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m46s)



[because of the first or default yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m49s)



[yeah and again that was that was kind of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m53s)



[the whole it was like I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m56s)



[avoid changing the logic in here as much](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h18m59s)



[as possible because yes I trust all of](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m01s)



[the unit tests I just don't trust me not](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m03s)



[to botch something](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m06s)



[so](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m10s)



[yeah](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m12s)



[interesting](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m14s)



[yeah it does get interesting I do like](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m17s)



[the nullable reference types they do](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m21s)



[they feel very prescriptive in that they](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m24s)



[force you to write code one particular](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m27s)



[way yeah right yeah which is both it](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m29s)



[feels good and and I understand why it's](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m33s)



[an optional feature and it turned off](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m37s)



[because I can see see it being really](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m39s)



[obnoxious it like I think it is great](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m41s)



[for production level code and I would](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m44s)



[probably leave it off every time when](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m45s)



[I'm prototyping because it really gets](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m47s)



[in the way yeah cool well sweet](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m50s)



[hopefully by next week I get this](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h19m58s)



[cleaned up for those people watching the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m01s)



[stream my intent is to go back to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m03s)



[Thursday night streaming I think I have](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m05s)



[gotten my schedule figured out after the](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m07s)



[quarantine stuff so that should happen](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m10s)



[there may be some ad hoc streams because](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m12s)



[now that I've got my home stuff figured](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m15s)



[out it's a little bit easier for me to](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m17s)



[just pop out and string for a little bit](https://youtu.be/qyuwhm7jvVM?t=02h20m18s)
