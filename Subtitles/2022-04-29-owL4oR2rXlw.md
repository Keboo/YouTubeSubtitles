[hello everyone welcome back um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m03s)

[before we get going just a a couple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m06s)

[things um i had a birthday recently and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m08s)

[my wonderful wife was kind enough to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m12s)

[gift me a new desk and because of my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m14s)

[green screen it's not obvious i'm in a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m16s)

[very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m19s)

[different setup so if things go horribly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m20s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m22s)

[cut me a little slack i had to redo some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m23s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m25s)

[i've joked in the past about having](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m26s)

[part of my streaming setup held together](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m28s)

[by spr spare sprinkler parts good news](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m30s)

[spare sprinkler parts are out i actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m33s)

[got a little pull mount now for my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m35s)

[camera which is great that works things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m37s)

[now sit and lights and that kind of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m40s)

[thing so hopefully it seems okay i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m42s)

[it's all working i kind of threw it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m45s)

[together last night we're gonna see how](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m47s)

[it goes also i just updated to the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m48s)

[latest visual studio because doing that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m51s)

[a few minutes before starting seemed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m53s)

[like a good idea i guess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m54s)

[um let me lock that down](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m56s)

[so uh tonight or actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h00m59s)

[back up announcements](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m02s)

[uh material design and xaml version 450](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m04s)

[i just kicked it out the door last night](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m07s)

[so that is now out in live a couple of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m09s)

[the big things that are in there the the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m11s)

[two main bugs that were breaking people](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m14s)

[with the transparent uh context menus](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m15s)

[and the the tab control missing its](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m19s)

[content both of those are in and fixed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m21s)

[there are lots of other problems for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m23s)

[people submitting issues on the tab](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m25s)

[control](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m26s)

[be aware it is a new thing that has only](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m28s)

[recently been added to the library so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m31s)

[yes i expect there to be some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m32s)

[bugs and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m34s)

[issues around it please log them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m35s)

[happy to get them fixed but it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m37s)

[something that is somewhat new uh being](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m40s)

[added into the library so for what it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m42s)

[worth](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m45s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m47s)

[so with that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m47s)

[some updates so earlier today and let me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m49s)

[see if i can remember how to use a mouse](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m52s)

[i'm going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m55s)

[drag some stuff onto the screen and i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h01m58s)

[press that button and huzzah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m01s)

[okay so for people who are interested](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m03s)

[the.net foundation they actually stream](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m05s)

[a bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m08s)

[code reviews and similar things and so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m09s)

[this one ended up being two parts](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m11s)

[due to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m15s)

[due to some technical difficulties](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m22s)

[so those are the two parts but this is a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m27s)

[a code review of some of the system](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m28s)

[command line api so if you want to dive](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m29s)

[very deep into system command line um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m32s)

[this is an interesting one specifically](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m35s)

[around the set handler method so there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m37s)

[was a bunch of api discussions and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m39s)

[proposals and trying to figure out what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m41s)

[is the correct api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m43s)

[right this isn't about necessarily](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m45s)

[opinion based but what is the best api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m47s)

[that's going to work the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m49s)

[work well for the most people that was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m51s)

[that was largely the discussion](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m53s)

[uh but as part of that um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m55s)

[one guy on there tanner uh gooding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h02m59s)

[tanner if i'm butchering your last name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m02s)

[i apologize um he](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m04s)

[uh has this library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m06s)

[called uh clang sharp](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m08s)

[and i know very little of this i have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m10s)

[not used it much i know that it is used](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m13s)

[as a p-invoke generator which is great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m19s)

[but i personally have not used it i've](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m20s)

[used other libraries that use it but i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m22s)

[have never](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m24s)

[personally uh made use of it effectively](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m25s)

[it generates up um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m28s)

[what i would call bindings](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m30s)

[uh for managed code into unmanaged](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m32s)

[but it is also leveraging an old version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m36s)

[of system command line and right at the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m39s)

[end of that call earlier today he made](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m41s)

[the comment that if somebody was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m42s)

[interested in updating him to the latest](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m44s)

[first assistant command line he would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m46s)

[happily be willing to take a look at uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m48s)

[the pr so my goal tonight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m51s)

[let's make the pr](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m54s)

[so should be fun](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m55s)

[so just to be clear](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h03m59s)

[i cloned this repository](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m02s)

[about um five minutes before i hit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m05s)

[update on visual studio so i know very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m07s)

[little about it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m10s)

[so just just so to level set i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m12s)

[know much about this library at all i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m15s)

[just recently looked at it um oh i'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m17s)

[drop a link if anybody is interested in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m20s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m23s)

[here is clang and then if anybody's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m24s)

[interested in this system command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m26s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m29s)

[um you can find lots of videos on it on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m30s)

[my youtube](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m35s)

[see below](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m36s)

[if you're watching the recording of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m38s)

[you probably already know where to find](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m40s)

[it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m41s)

[uh it's on the same channel](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m42s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m44s)

[unless you're watching on twitch where](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m46s)

[they don't keep my recordings very long](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m47s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m49s)

[here i managed to find my way into a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m50s)

[couple things so the first thing to note](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m53s)

[down here uh this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m55s)

[is the one that actually has the package](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h04m58s)

[reference to system command line i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m00s)

[pretty confident he's the only one i saw](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m02s)

[which makes this a pretty easy so we are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m06s)

[only interested in this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m08s)

[he is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m11s)

[uh the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m12s)

[the clang sharp p invoke generator not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m14s)

[to be confused with the clang shark dot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m16s)

[p invoke generator](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m19s)

[again i have no idea what the difference](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m21s)

[is except for this one references system](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m22s)

[command line the other one doesn't so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m24s)

[he's he's the guy we are after um you'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m27s)

[note here this isn't a normal package](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m30s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m32s)

[i did notice he's got some fun ms build](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m33s)

[stuff going on where he does a package](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m36s)

[reference update so that he can have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m37s)

[centralized version management which i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m39s)

[think is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m41s)

[i think it's pretty cool so let's go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m43s)

[here i'm actually kind of curious i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m46s)

[don't i don't think the tooling handles](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m50s)

[look at that it does](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m52s)

[huh i wonder if it's going to update](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m56s)

[appropriately when i click this button](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h05m58s)

[let me just make sure](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m05s)

[yeah so nuget.org and net libraries](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m07s)

[three](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m10s)

[two two one one four point one versus](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m12s)

[the internal](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m14s)

[how latest and greatest let's go with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m18s)

[just on nougat](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m20s)

[because they're both beta 3 and i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m22s)

[think i don't think there's likely huge](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m24s)

[apis between the nightly and what's out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m26s)

[on nougat right now i don't know that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m28s)

[for a fact there may be some bug fixes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m30s)

[i don't i don't think there's going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m33s)

[be big api changes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m34s)

[okay so that gets us there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m36s)

[oh it did okay so the tooling wasn't hip](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m40s)

[to figuring out where the version was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m42s)

[supposed to go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m44s)

[okay it just slapped it on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m45s)

[it slapped it on that and we really want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m48s)

[it up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m50s)

[here so we're gonna put this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m52s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m56s)

[and we're gonna build it because the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h06m58s)

[other thing that i know is this project](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m00s)

[was very wonderful i cloned it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m02s)

[i fired it up i it compiled](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m05s)

[and then i hit run tests](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m08s)

[and it just worked](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m10s)

[and i went oh that was easy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m12s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m15s)

[okay so this is kind of what we expect](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m17s)

[not nearly as many as i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m20s)

[thought i was gonna get but let's let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m22s)

[take a look at the code that's failing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m23s)

[okay so he has rolled](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m26s)

[a custom help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m28s)

[which not surprising that this one is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m32s)

[causing problems because this has had](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m36s)

[some pretty significant](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m39s)

[api changes to it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m42s)

[and i'm kind of curious as to what is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m44s)

[so what all is he doing here yeah so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m50s)

[we've got there is probably a bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m52s)

[cleanup we can do to make this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m54s)

[easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m56s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m57s)

[thinking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h07m58s)

[the easiest thing at the moment is just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m00s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m01s)

[uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m07s)

[render as columns is out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m09s)

[uh actually you know what this whole](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m13s)

[method we're just gonna we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m15s)

[drop stuff because i think most of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m16s)

[is probably not needed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m18s)

[and help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m23s)

[yeah because help builder no longer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m28s)

[takes in the console to do the writing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m31s)

[instead it kicks back a string if i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m33s)

[if i remember correctly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m38s)

[trying to remember the exact api changes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m40s)

[in here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m42s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m44s)

[right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m46s)

[yeah so this is the method to override](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m47s)

[and if i remember right this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m50s)

[oh text writer output so it just dumps](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m55s)

[stuff out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m58s)

[so that's that's the key one to to do so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h08m59s)

[let's let's start there so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m02s)

[override](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m04s)

[help context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m07s)

[this is going to be this is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m09s)

[where we want to actually do all of our](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m10s)

[work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m12s)

[use block body we're going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m14s)

[turn you off](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m17s)

[and we're going to turn you off we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m20s)

[going to need to come back and look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m21s)

[these but we're just going to look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m22s)

[getting it working first](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m23s)

[and then the constructor under the hood](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m25s)

[max width and localization resources](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m29s)

[so i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m33s)

[think there's much we need to do here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m34s)

[because it looks like he was just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m39s)

[forwarding on the same](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m40s)

[same bits okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m43s)

[let's go there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m45s)

[chase the rest of them help item](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m47s)

[okay so let's see so this here i suspect](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m53s)

[is all around generating](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h09m57s)

[yes this was using the old help item](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m01s)

[class](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m03s)

[we're building out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m05s)

[all of that i think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m07s)

[do is we're going to just take the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m09s)

[the stance of we'll circle back to this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m11s)

[after we get it compiling](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m13s)

[and clean it up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m17s)

[handler is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m18s)

[that guy there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m22s)

[and then this value for option bit is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m24s)

[what is going away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m26s)

[well](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m31s)

[the good news is everything is in one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m32s)

[place](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m34s)

[okay so let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m36s)

[spend a few minutes and figure out what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m37s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m40s)

[heck all is going on in here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m43s)

[interesting that version's hard coded](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m46s)

[oh i guess this is root commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m53s)

[description so this is the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m55s)

[maybe the cli version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h10m58s)

[which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m00s)

[isn't being pulled from somewhere else](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m01s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m04s)

[get on board with that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m09s)

[wow there's a lot going on here okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m11s)

[lots of string stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m17s)

[okay so big switch setting up options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m22s)

[based upon which options are specified a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m25s)

[lot of these things look to just be um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m27s)

[so the in c sharp this is a a bit wise](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m30s)

[or](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m33s)

[so i'm going to go with this thing it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m34s)

[probably a flag d nu](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m36s)

[which it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m38s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m39s)

[when you do that bitwise or these are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m40s)

[all basically individual switches you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m42s)

[can turn on and off](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m44s)

[so based upon](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m46s)

[anything on that thing that gets passed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m47s)

[it's just gonna toggle a bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m49s)

[switches on or off which is great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m52s)

[looks like there's maybe a couple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m55s)

[different options and based upon how](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m57s)

[things are going](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h11m59s)

[this thing gens up a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m01s)

[different ways great great great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m02s)

[bakery great okay this is the custom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m04s)

[help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m06s)

[so this is building that up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m10s)

[okay and this is where those right and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m18s)

[uh lines were going](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m19s)

[i think these things are likely just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m22s)

[going to get pushed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m24s)

[as oh option versus options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m28s)

[got it okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m34s)

[and then let's see what is this if there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m41s)

[are is so that's if there is print uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m43s)

[config help great and then it early](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m45s)

[returns otherwise if there are any](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m47s)

[errors](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m50s)

[we're going to write out some stuff so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m52s)

[this is an invocation context okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m54s)

[we've got the invocation context there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h12m57s)

[we're going to write some errors](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m00s)

[to the console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m02s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m05s)

[this we do a new help builder and dump](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m06s)

[help out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m09s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m14s)

[i think this change is easy because i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m15s)

[think that's just that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m18s)

[that much is pretty simple and then we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m23s)

[get all the way down further](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m26s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m30s)

[there's a couple ways i guess to go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m31s)

[about doing this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m33s)

[so this is very much using](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m34s)

[acting on the parsing stuff by](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m38s)

[themselves](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m40s)

[so here's what so one of the key changes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m44s)

[here is going to be uh context parse](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m46s)

[result because you can still get in here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m49s)

[and you can do value for option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m53s)

[which you'll note exists and so we can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m56s)

[still do this kind of string thingy the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h13m58s)

[the thing is is rather than this just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m02s)

[magical string of additional what we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m04s)

[going to end up needing is something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m07s)

[like uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m08s)

[uh option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m10s)

[because i can kind of guess the types on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m12s)

[my way through here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m15s)

[it looks something like that and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m24s)

[this is going to look something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m26s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m32s)

[so and then this is gonna go here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m36s)

[and look something about like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m41s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m49s)

[rather than string based approach it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m50s)

[requires you to actually pass in the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m52s)

[object one of the things that came up on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m54s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m56s)

[i'll call it code review](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h14m58s)

[stream earlier as there was a lot of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m00s)

[discussion about how these options and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m01s)

[commands work and specifically getting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m03s)

[values back out one thing that may not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m05s)

[always be apparent to people if you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m08s)

[acting on the low-level apis like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m09s)

[is that these options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m12s)

[they don't actually contain the value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m15s)

[themselves](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m17s)

[the analogy that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m18s)

[i used earlier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m21s)

[is if you think of these similar to like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m22s)

[the reflection apis and net where you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m24s)

[have say a property info the property](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m27s)

[info object itself doesn't contain the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m29s)

[value of a given property it merely](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m31s)

[contains the description of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m34s)

[what that property is and how to get the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m37s)

[value out given an instance](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m39s)

[the parse result is the actual you can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m41s)

[almost think of it as the instance so if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m43s)

[this is like your property info](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m45s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m48s)

[get value for option is like using the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m48s)

[property info to pull it back out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m51s)

[for what it's worth](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m55s)

[my way of just conceptually visualizing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h15m58s)

[how the system command line apis work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m00s)

[is treat these like an info object](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m03s)

[and the parse result almost more like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m05s)

[the instance because when your command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m07s)

[line is invoked that parse result is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m09s)

[effectively the instance of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m11s)

[invocation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m12s)

[and then you can use the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m14s)

[metadata once to get it out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m16s)

[now the question i have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m18s)

[so this is just being passed into](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m22s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m30s)

[so i think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m38s)

[is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m41s)

[structure this guy up a little bit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m43s)

[differently](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m45s)

[we're gonna we're gonna collapse you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m46s)

[so there is uh this root command which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m48s)

[is being](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m51s)

[set up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m52s)

[and the these options here now we are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m54s)

[probably going to want to type these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h16m58s)

[i'm trying to look at what this is doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m04s)

[so this is creating an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m15s)

[let's see here argument type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m16s)

[it's interesting that this is argument](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m22s)

[type of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m25s)

[and then an arity of one or more this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m27s)

[really should be string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m30s)

[so we're going to get so you'll note](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m32s)

[once i switch to the generic this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m34s)

[is going to change](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m37s)

[get default value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m40s)

[and then arity doesn't get specified](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m43s)

[here anymore i think you have to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m46s)

[erity](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m48s)

[as with the property setter if i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m49s)

[remember right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m51s)

[here stop it stop it stop it stop it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m56s)

[stop it uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h17m58s)

[uh is this an argument erity](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m08s)

[yeah so this is just going to move down](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m11s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m14s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m16s)

[is there a formatting thing or something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m20s)

[on that i'm missing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m22s)

[okay so this is adding it in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m24s)

[i'm trying to decide if this is really](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m29s)

[the easiest way to go about doing this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m31s)

[because ultimately we are going to need](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m34s)

[access to this option here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m36s)

[and i'm wondering if it actually makes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m45s)

[more sense to just push these things up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m47s)

[here so this thing main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m49s)

[creates the root command adds a bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m51s)

[options to it and then calls invoke](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h18m53s)

[and we could use the binder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m17s)

[to pass all of this stuff through so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m20s)

[that we don't have to do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m22s)

[this mess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m24s)

[trying to decide because that's uh i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m27s)

[don't know how many options but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m28s)

[we'll say a lot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m31s)

[that's a lot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m35s)

[me go and look real quick i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m38s)

[i'm curious if there is that's not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m41s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m46s)

[docs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m46s)

[i'm curious](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m50s)

[model binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m52s)

[i'm thinking what we probably want to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m54s)

[is bind](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h19m56s)

[and these docs don't appear to be fully](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m00s)

[updated either which is it's just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m03s)

[killing me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m05s)

[close robert if by wpf you mean c laying](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m07s)

[sharp and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m11s)

[p invoke you would be correct](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m12s)

[there was a um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m20s)

[code review](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m22s)

[for the system command line before and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m24s)

[one of the guys in there tanner made a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m26s)

[comment that he would love it if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m28s)

[somebody would update ceiling sharp to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m29s)

[the latest system command line because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m32s)

[he built it on an older version of the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m34s)

[api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m36s)

[so i am looking at trying to figure out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m38s)

[what is the cleanest way to go ahead and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m41s)

[do this okay we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m43s)

[docs are not helping me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m46s)

[i have a strong urge to curse all things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m48s)

[p invoke no no this this library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m50s)

[underpins a lot of the ones so if you've](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m53s)

[seen the rapper libraries that wrap uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m56s)

[native libs a lot of them will leverage](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h20m58s)

[ceiling sharp so this is the generator](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m02s)

[that a lot of the other libraries end up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m05s)

[using](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m07s)

[so that you don't have to hate it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m12s)

[but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m13s)

[i'm trying to figure out because this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m15s)

[command line here basically is a very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m17s)

[flat structure it's got one command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m19s)

[a metric ton of options on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m23s)

[and then down here it wants to parse all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m30s)

[of these things and and go to town](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m32s)

[so i'd like to find a cleaner approach](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m36s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m41s)

[what i what i want to look at because i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m42s)

[don't remember the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m45s)

[i don't remember the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m48s)

[binding one i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m50s)

[because i'd prefer to not bind them flat](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m55s)

[that will get ugly ugly fast](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h21m57s)

[i'd much prefer to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m02s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m04s)

[and i'm trying to remember what the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m05s)

[rules are around model binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m07s)

[set handler class with multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m10s)

[constructor like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m12s)

[that would work ish it would hide the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m14s)

[the ugliness in one place](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m17s)

[i don't know if i like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m20s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m23s)

[i don't um if there's a cleaner](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m25s)

[custom type custom instance custom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m35s)

[binder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m43s)

[get bound value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m46s)

[this might be the cleanest option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m48s)

[this might be the cleanest option given](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m54s)

[the complexity here because part of what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m57s)

[is going on in this code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h22m59s)

[is all around so when this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m02s)

[actually gets invoked it does all of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m04s)

[this building up of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m06s)

[and a bunch of bitwise math](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m12s)

[and i kind of feel like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m16s)

[we don't want that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m22s)

[i don't think i want all of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m26s)

[and i also don't know if i like the root](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m31s)

[command invoke a sync i kind of want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m33s)

[leverage because there's a couple things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m35s)

[in here that are being added on and so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m37s)

[one there's some custom help stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m39s)

[that's being done and the custom help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m41s)

[output is fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m44s)

[but the the checking for help is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m46s)

[something that surprised me or like the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m48s)

[checking for version like what is this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m51s)

[why is version so special](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m53s)

[there's built-in support for checking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m56s)

[for version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h23m58s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m01s)

[yeah i don't know why](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m10s)

[we might](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m13s)

[okay so i'm going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m14s)

[i'm going to do one thing real quick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m16s)

[where's my where's my get cracking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m17s)

[come here get cracking i need you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m22s)

[i don't see it uh dev](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m24s)

[system command line oh it's going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m29s)

[under c because it's command line api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m31s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m34s)

[let me go take a little look-see here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m36s)

[uh i want to be on main reset local](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m42s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m46s)

[open](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m47s)

[and i want to take a little bit of a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m49s)

[look at this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m51s)

[also a bug on here i need to go and fix](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m53s)

[i want to look at what the version one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m56s)

[does because i don't think we need to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h24m57s)

[i don't think we need to be this complex](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m00s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m02s)

[this is not doing that much it's it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m04s)

[sprinted out a little bit of version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m06s)

[options i think we can get away with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m08s)

[something a lot simpler](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m11s)

[uh close you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m15s)

[i i think we can get away with something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m18s)

[simpler and tanner i apologize if you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m20s)

[watching this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m22s)

[if i'm over complicating things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m23s)

[um okay so let's take a look at version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m32s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m33s)

[yeah so what this this method is the one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m37s)

[i want to see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m40s)

[so the tests are good but this this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m41s)

[the method i really am interested in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m44s)

[looking at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m45s)

[come on come on don't help me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m47s)

[get out of the way](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m49s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m51s)

[version option this one builds it up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m52s)

[adds it in adds in middleware](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h25m56s)

[i guess there's not a lot you can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m01s)

[leverage if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m03s)

[i guess you do kind of have to roll your](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m06s)

[own](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m07s)

[that's a little disappointing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m09s)

[it's a little disappointing there's not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m18s)

[a cleaner way to do output as](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m19s)

[as something a little bit different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m29s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m31s)

[yeah this isn't much](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m41s)

[okay so we're gonna we're gonna we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m44s)

[gonna go through this but i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m46s)

[ultimately what we wanna do is we wanna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m47s)

[get ourselves into something like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m49s)

[i think we want to start here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m52s)

[so let's go back here so we've got all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m56s)

[that options all these options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h26m58s)

[all these options okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m01s)

[so at the end of the day we want to get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m04s)

[ourselves down to something that looks a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m06s)

[little bit more akin to a parser](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m07s)

[give me the builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m10s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m12s)

[using command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m13s)

[we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m15s)

[and i think i can just feed in uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m18s)

[root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m21s)

[the top](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m23s)

[parser](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m25s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m35s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m39s)

[and i think that's where so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m42s)

[that's what we want to get to is that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m44s)

[working](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m46s)

[um this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m47s)

[we're gonna end up getting rid of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m50s)

[this is going to become s root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m52s)

[set handler](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h27m56s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m00s)

[this is just going to be a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m02s)

[invocation of run](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m04s)

[and then we are going to need to pass in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m09s)

[a binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m12s)

[and i think this is where we're going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m13s)

[dive back into the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m15s)

[something a bit more like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m18s)

[i think we do a custom binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m24s)

[really the simplest option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m29s)

[that are a bunch of flat stuff i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m31s)

[like that either](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m33s)

[that says this is yucky to me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m35s)

[that says yucky to me so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m38s)

[generic method definition](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m47s)

[ignore the pile of generic stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m52s)

[yeah i think let's go with a custom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m58s)

[binder because then we can do our own](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h28m59s)

[binding on here and do our own building](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m04s)

[we're just gonna steal this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m05s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m09s)

[for now we're going to put it up here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m10s)

[we'll come back to it in a minute and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m13s)

[we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m17s)

[i think this is where we're going to put](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m24s)

[all the stuffs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m25s)

[i think this is where we're going to put](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m28s)

[it all i'm just going to stuff it in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m29s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m31s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m32s)

[is this really easier than just doing a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m37s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m39s)

[because we could do we could be stupid](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m44s)

[simple and just do a constructor it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m46s)

[going to be an ugly constructor because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m49s)

[it's going to look like that but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m51s)

[grumble grumble grumble grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m56s)

[grumble grumble grumble grumble i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m57s)

[know what i like better let's let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h29m59s)

[start with a constructor let's keep it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m01s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m02s)

[actually you know what let's start even](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m04s)

[simpler let's let's not do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m05s)

[let's not even do a type let's let's go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m08s)

[flat binding for now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m09s)

[because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m12s)

[what this is under the hood here is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m13s)

[something that looks a heck of a lot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m17s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m19s)

[so that's going to go like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m24s)

[and then what we want to do is we want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m26s)

[to change this add](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m28s)

[be something that actually returns it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m31s)

[because we're going to want this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m33s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m38s)

[and i think what we're going to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m39s)

[we're going to drop](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m42s)

[the idea that we need to pass in the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m44s)

[root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m45s)

[and this guy's just gonna be a straight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m50s)

[return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h30m52s)

[get get has a weird connotation to it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m02s)

[create](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m06s)

[i don't know we'll leave it as ad for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m13s)

[now it's it's a very misleading name but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m15s)

[we're gonna roll with it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m17s)

[okay so up at the top](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m18s)

[what we can actually get away with now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m22s)

[is something like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m26s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m29s)

[option of string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m34s)

[additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m37s)

[add additional option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m38s)

[then this becomes additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m41s)

[and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m44s)

[additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m46s)

[what is your problem](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m48s)

[use var instead of additional time there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m51s)

[must be a editor config](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m53s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m56s)

[the type arguments for cannot be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h31m59s)

[inferred](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m02s)

[really this is about to get ugly fast if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m08s)

[i have to specify all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m13s)

[oh i re if i remember correctly set](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m14s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m16s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m19s)

[because we're going to run into a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m20s)

[problem here at 16 parameters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m22s)

[yeah that's going to be a problem](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m25s)

[back to custom type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m32s)

[we're gonna go like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m45s)

[uh so additional there additional there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m48s)

[and then this handler nope](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m52s)

[this run method should take in a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h32m55s)

[so how do we get this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m08s)

[working for the moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m11s)

[so we can get this thing compiling and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m14s)

[running](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m16s)

[so i think what we're gonna do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m17s)

[something fancy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m22s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m27s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m29s)

[match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m30s)

[we're going to turn on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m34s)

[regular expression matching](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m38s)

[escape that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m42s)

[escape that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m44s)

[let's see escape that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m47s)

[keep that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h33m53s)

[where is the other ones](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m01s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m10s)

[i'm gonna do this uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m12s)

[friend](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m15s)

[yeah plus](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m40s)

[there we go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m42s)

[okay so that's going to get us all of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m43s)

[those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m45s)

[and we are going to replace it with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m46s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m50s)

[dollar sign zero commented out on the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m52s)

[end](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m54s)

[of the line and we will replace it with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h34m55s)

[default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m00s)

[of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m01s)

[dollar sign one i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m03s)

[place all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m07s)

[i love it when a regex comes together](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m14s)

[okay regex coding for the win](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m17s)

[okay so custom help builder wants](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m20s)

[localized resources so this becomes easy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m23s)

[that is on the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m26s)

[there's a wise resources that list there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m29s)

[we're going to just comment out these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m33s)

[lines here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m34s)

[because right now we're going for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m37s)

[compilation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m38s)

[uh custom help builder this is once](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m40s)

[again localized resources with some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m42s)

[writing there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m46s)

[and then this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m49s)

[something like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h35m58s)

[and then our last compiler is up here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m01s)

[it goes like that okay so set handler](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m08s)

[location context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m19s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m22s)

[um i cut them tight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m24s)

[uh has the wrong return type oh this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m31s)

[thing is expected to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m34s)

[oh these are void](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m44s)

[right so ron needs to become void](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m50s)

[i believe that means down here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h36m57s)

[let's see context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m01s)

[exit code gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m06s)

[minus one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m08s)

[and then just straight return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m11s)

[and just copy this guy around](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m15s)

[so i have a feeling that's exactly what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m18s)

[we're going to be doing in a most of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m19s)

[these situations boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m27s)

[not sure why that's squawking all of a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m30s)

[sudden](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m32s)

[expression value is never used](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m36s)

[here i'll make it easy there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m42s)

[it's exit code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m47s)

[and then we don't need to return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m50s)

[okay so that goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m53s)

[i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h37m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m00s)

[build](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m01s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m10s)

[so that goes there i wonder are there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m12s)

[any](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m16s)

[there's a lot of tests](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m20s)

[hypothetically](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m22s)

[let's find out if there's any tests over](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m23s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m25s)

[because given that we just commented out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m26s)

[a swath of code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m28s)

[if there are any tests over that main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m30s)

[method i'm very confident we will be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m31s)

[running into them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m33s)

[but it would not be uncommon for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m37s)

[tests to be at a slightly lower level](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m40s)

[we will see there are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m43s)

[a sizeable number of tests so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m45s)

[3400 tests 3500 almost it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m48s)

[nothing to scoff at that's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m52s)

[pretty significant test suite](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h38m56s)

[we'll let that guy run](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m03s)

[kind of want to look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m06s)

[uh let's see so on the tests](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m09s)

[just want to make sure there's nothing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m18s)

[in here that i'm forgetting about that i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m19s)

[should](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m22s)

[should be doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m24s)

[because a very few of these actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m29s)

[show](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m42s)

[that doesn't work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m43s)

[that's not a great one this is the one i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m47s)

[was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m49s)

[somewhat looking at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m50s)

[the system command line is pretty good](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m56s)

[if it can figure out how to convert to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h39m58s)

[the target type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m00s)

[type convention tests](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m03s)

[yeah because you'll note like file info](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m05s)

[it can figure out from strings directory](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m07s)

[info](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m09s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m14s)

[yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m17s)

[go back okay so no tests over this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m20s)

[that's a little scarier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m23s)

[that's a little scarier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m25s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m28s)

[we are going to have to test this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m29s)

[ourselves](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m31s)

[so we're going to do something like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m33s)

[i'm guessing we don't have normal](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m36s)

[reference types turned on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m38s)

[no okay that's fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m40s)

[no nullable reference types](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m43s)

[um we can work with this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m45s)

[so what i would like to do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m48s)

[test the invocation of this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m51s)

[and confirm what i think i know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m54s)

[so let's do that first so give me a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h40m58s)

[terminal](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m01s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m02s)

[uh cd](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m07s)

[where is the sources](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m10s)

[uh pmo generator where the non one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m16s)

[so dotnet run](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m20s)

[and then i think i want to just do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m24s)

[actually there was a description of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m30s)

[on the readme let's take a quick gander](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m32s)

[over there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m35s)

[because the nice part is there was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m36s)

[yeah so it had this little guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m40s)

[so i should be able to do dash a and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m43s)

[then string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m45s)

[and see that come through](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m47s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m50s)

[oh that's actually not going to hit my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m53s)

[debugger now is it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h41m54s)

[that is not going to hit my debugger so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m02s)

[let's set this guy up with a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m05s)

[debug setting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m08s)

[all right so if we go here we go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m11s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m13s)

[and we want debugging](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m16s)

[open debug launch profiles oh look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m19s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m21s)

[i don't think any of these are what i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m28s)

[want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m30s)

[create a new profile](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m34s)

[project](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m36s)

[command line arguments so this is where](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m38s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m40s)

[dash a foo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m42s)

[yeah so you're gonna you're gonna be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m47s)

[problematic so just go there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m49s)

[uh remote machine name environment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m52s)

[variables](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h42m54s)

[save that for the moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m02s)

[yeah so this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m10s)

[a bunch of response files oh cool so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m13s)

[he's actually got](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m15s)

[oh that's cool](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m18s)

[sweet](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m24s)

[that's rather clever](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m27s)

[we're gonna start simple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m31s)

[uh okay so we're gonna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m33s)

[take this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m36s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m40s)

[i would like to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m44s)

[execute this profile why am i not seeing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m46s)

[it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m50s)

[oh because i'm not on the right project](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m56s)

[uh set a startup](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h43m59s)

[and then there's my profile](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m02s)

[now when i go fire it off i should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m05s)

[able to hit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m08s)

[i guess i should have probably set a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m10s)

[break point if i want to do anything](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m11s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m16s)

[uh for the parameter at position zero](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m19s)

[did you mean to pass one of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m26s)

[this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m27s)

[and we can kind of cheat a little bit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m35s)

[and just drop this all together](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m37s)

[because that shouldn't be needed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m40s)

[oh if i drop you i might need to go and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m50s)

[look at what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m52s)

[that setup was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m54s)

[it's not clear here's the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m57s)

[the debug window but where](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h44m59s)

[stupid arrow shake](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m01s)

[okay so there's our invocation context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m08s)

[should have some stuff on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m11s)

[there's our parse result](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m13s)

[i can see that it ended up parsing a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m15s)

[bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m20s)

[rate](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m23s)

[part of me is really tempted to just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m32s)

[skip the binding and go back to the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m33s)

[parse context for all of these because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m35s)

[that would still work for this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m37s)

[just feels so yucky](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m41s)

[feels yucky feels yucky let's look i i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m44s)

[just want to look before i do something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m46s)

[crazy like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m48s)

[custom model binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h45m53s)

[i don't think there are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m02s)

[location contexts](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m05s)

[yeah i guess we go with flat for the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m27s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m29s)

[all right so let's go with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m31s)

[and those are going to drop and then if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m55s)

[we rerun this we should see additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m56s)

[artists get populated with foo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h46m59s)

[one in there and it's foo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m05s)

[okay so that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m06s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m09s)

[probably works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m10s)

[i guess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m14s)

[i'll feel good about it but it works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m16s)

[i don't feel great about this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m26s)

[okay we're gonna do some regex magic](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m28s)

[real quick but we're gonna get get it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m30s)

[work so general rule of thumb](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m32s)

[get it working get it right get it fast](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m36s)

[this will be the get it working part of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m39s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m41s)

[of the adventure](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m42s)

[okay so first thing we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m45s)

[so let's see start of line match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m47s)

[oh regix on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m50s)

[uh match white space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m53s)

[uh multiple characters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m55s)

[replace with empty string boom okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h47m58s)

[then we're gonna start with matching](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m01s)

[double slash any character](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m04s)

[multiple repetitions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m07s)

[to the end of the line replace with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m10s)

[empty string boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m12s)

[okay so what we would like to do is get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m14s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m16s)

[we're going to do all these in one shot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m18s)

[we would like to get variable name and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m19s)

[type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m22s)

[so what we want to match on is a couple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m23s)

[things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m25s)

[so we're going to have var](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m26s)

[space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m28s)

[friend](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m29s)

[uh some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m31s)

[characters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m33s)

[so how about not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m34s)

[white space any number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m37s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m42s)

[was it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m45s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m46s)

[non-white space any number of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m48s)

[repetitions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m49s)

[face](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m51s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m52s)

[default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m54s)

[literal paren](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h48m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m00s)

[any character some number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m03s)

[uh and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m07s)

[backslash](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m13s)

[oh i need one more opening paren here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m16s)

[okay so that has given me so these two](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m19s)

[parens here are just for the capture](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m21s)

[groups](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m23s)

[and then we'll just grab the semicolon](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m24s)

[for good measure](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m26s)

[okay and so then what we want to replace](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m28s)

[this with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m30s)

[is the variable name which is going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m31s)

[be our first capture group so dollar](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m34s)

[sign one or i'm sorry that we actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m36s)

[want the type first so dollar sign two](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m38s)

[for our second capture group here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m42s)

[space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m44s)

[uh variable name dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m45s)

[we want a comma](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m48s)

[and then i want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m50s)

[a new line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m52s)

[make it so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m54s)

[i didn't quite do what i wanted so we'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m56s)

[undo that real quick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h49m58s)

[do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m00s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m01s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m03s)

[and i guess i don't actually need the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m07s)

[new line since each of these are on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m08s)

[their own new line so we really can get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m09s)

[away with just this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m11s)

[great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m16s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m17s)

[and now we have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m19s)

[the rest of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m22s)

[which is great get rid of the closing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m24s)

[comma](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m27s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m28s)

[you won't indent correctly for me so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m32s)

[that's fine we're going to come up here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m34s)

[we'll do that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m36s)

[okay so that gave me all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m37s)

[so pretty much all of this can go away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m41s)

[because those are now going to be passed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m45s)

[in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m47s)

[okay now we got to get all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m49s)

[things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m52s)

[converted](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m54s)

[let's do the same thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h50m56s)

[we're going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m02s)

[copy this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m03s)

[come over here and do some more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m05s)

[regexi magic](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m07s)

[so we'll start with the whole](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m09s)

[uh let's see start of line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m11s)

[white space some number of repetitions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m14s)

[place with nothing boom okay so that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m18s)

[fixes that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m21s)

[now we want to match add](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m23s)

[some character because this is going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m27s)

[be the name of the thingymabobber](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m29s)

[we're going to then have option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m32s)

[and i think we can just blindly match to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m38s)

[the end](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m40s)

[because what we really want to do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m42s)

[gen up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m45s)

[wrong solution](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m47s)

[what we really want to do is gen up this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m49s)

[pattern here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m51s)

[so i'd really like to do var](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m53s)

[name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m55s)

[method without this so that's that's my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m57s)

[target](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h51m59s)

[let's just grab this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m01s)

[and back to vs code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m04s)

[we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m06s)

[so this is going to be var and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m09s)

[it'll be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m12s)

[dollar sign one albeit it would be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m13s)

[better with case](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m19s)

[and then this will be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m24s)

[dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m27s)

[that gets me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m37s)

[pretty close](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m38s)

[yeah that'll work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m42s)

[we'll uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m43s)

[fix the casing on each of these here in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m46s)

[a minute](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m47s)

[but that will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m50s)

[go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m51s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m52s)

[a lesson in regex coding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m54s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m56s)

[c d](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h52m57s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m11s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m12s)

[v](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m22s)

[and a whole bunch of w's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m25s)

[uh this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m31s)

[what is your complaining canadas](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m37s)

[okay so all of these things are void](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m39s)

[returning](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m41s)

[so if s config option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m43s)

[is null](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m47s)

[is likely to be called in two places no](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m50s)

[i don't know why we have this check here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h53m57s)

[so this is going to become option of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m01s)

[spring ray](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m04s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m07s)

[this becomes just a straight return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m12s)

[this becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m15s)

[option of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m17s)

[spring array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m19s)

[and i think we can just confirm that by](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m25s)

[the generated type on this side](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m28s)

[yeah string array so i'm going to just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m30s)

[put you on the side for a minute](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m31s)

[that's where i can keep an eye on you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m34s)

[argument type is going to go away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m37s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m41s)

[default value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m42s)

[oh and arity needs to change to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m45s)

[arity](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m52s)

[the people who may not be familiar with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m54s)

[the term arity it just means the the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m55s)

[count or the number of them how many can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m57s)

[be there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h54m59s)

[okay so we have this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m03s)

[oh and you are squawking because you are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m07s)

[not typed to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m10s)

[string array but now you are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m12s)

[okay so that should be happier now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m18s)

[oh and i did not drop](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m25s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m28s)

[so let's hunt for add](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m33s)

[option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m37s)

[rin](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m39s)

[uh oh we need this to be a literal prin](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m42s)

[root](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m45s)

[command space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m46s)

[any number of characters literal closing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m48s)

[paren](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m51s)

[and replace with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h55m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m01s)

[let's see dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m04s)

[friend friend](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m06s)

[see isn't that easier than writing code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m14s)

[sumo super is it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m17s)

[find macro](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m20s)

[but this is also](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m22s)

[uh option of string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m23s)

[see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m26s)

[i can't type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m30s)

[argument type goes away and i'm pretty](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m34s)

[sure default value can probably go away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m37s)

[we'll check it um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m41s)

[already gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m44s)

[arguing already one or more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m47s)

[it goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m51s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m53s)

[this becomes a straight return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h56m55s)

[actually most of these things are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m04s)

[optional string array so we'll just do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m08s)

[that that should clean that up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m10s)

[uh exclude option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m13s)

[exclude name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m18s)

[exclude names](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m22s)

[we're gonna do that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m25s)

[do that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m28s)

[already gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m36s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m55s)

[next up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m56s)

[uh let's see file option is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h57m58s)

[the same thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m01s)

[going to be the same thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m03s)

[could be a return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m06s)

[actually you know what i think we can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m09s)

[probably let's just do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m11s)

[so let's hunt for argument](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m13s)

[type colon](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m16s)

[base any actually we don't need the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m19s)

[space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m21s)

[any number of characters to the end of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m22s)

[the line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m24s)

[just grab the comma](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m26s)

[and then end of line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m30s)

[replace with empty](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m36s)

[uh let's see i'd like to let's actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m44s)

[do this rather matching on that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m46s)

[any number of characters after the comma](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m49s)

[and then grab the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m53s)

[new line character](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h58m55s)

[close enough](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m00s)

[we will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m08s)

[deal with it as it comes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m09s)

[uh let's see where were we at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m11s)

[file option so that guy that guy there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m15s)

[uh already gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m20s)

[argumentarity](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m23s)

[one or more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m24s)

[get rid of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m27s)

[semicolon and that goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m32s)

[see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m38s)

[file directory this becomes actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m40s)

[option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m42s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m47s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m48s)

[i'm trying to remember what the default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m57s)

[arity is for string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=00h59m59s)

[if we look](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m04s)

[this is creating an op an argument of t](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m08s)

[and one of these guys has the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m12s)

[defaultarity rules](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m14s)

[i don't remember what exactly they are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m17s)

[one of you has the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m26s)

[where's the default artist set](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m29s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m36s)

[where is the default already set on this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m37s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m39s)

[okay let's just go system command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m44s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m48s)

[i want that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m50s)

[already](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m52s)

[default already](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h00m54s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m04s)

[it's down in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m05s)

[validated](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m08s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m10s)

[default there we are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m12s)

[if it's not string and enumerable which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m19s)

[array is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m21s)

[a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m24s)

[parent is command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m26s)

[so if it's a parent](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m30s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m35s)

[in our case our parent for this argument](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m36s)

[will be an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m38s)

[so we would hit one or more for most of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m40s)

[our other ones](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m42s)

[so if we look at close this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m43s)

[one or more so this is going to end up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m48s)

[being the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m49s)

[default that's fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m55s)

[that's that's fine so we will get one or](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h01m59s)

[more there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m01s)

[but then what is the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m02s)

[string so this is explicitly not string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m06s)

[parent is command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m10s)

[we aren't going to hit this so we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m16s)

[going to be exactly one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m25s)

[exactly one does that line up with what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m26s)

[we were expecting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m28s)

[here for string yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m32s)

[that already is the default as well](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m34s)

[we'll just get rid of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m37s)

[we'll get rid of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m39s)

[i get default value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m41s)

[and then this should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m55s)

[option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h02m57s)

[that goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m02s)

[that goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m03s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m06s)

[we can actually clean up these ones here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m07s)

[real quick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m10s)

[these one or more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m19s)

[all match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m21s)

[the default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m23s)

[okay carry down our merry way](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m25s)

[header this is option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m28s)

[let's just slap that guy on there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m34s)

[exactly one matches the default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m38s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m42s)

[this just becomes a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m43s)

[turn](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m46s)

[cleans that up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m48s)

[include option this is string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h03m51s)

[and this becomes a return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m02s)

[already one or more is fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m05s)

[okay include directory option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m15s)

[interesting this is also string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m23s)

[the variable name is include directories](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m26s)

[i wonder if that's a typo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m29s)

[maybe it's named this way intention link](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m33s)

[because it's the use directory option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m35s)

[that can be specified multiple times](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m37s)

[see here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m50s)

[so in case it's not obvious this get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m52s)

[default value is actually a funk](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m54s)

[so array.empty is being used as a method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h04m56s)

[group so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m00s)

[functionally you could also think of it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m02s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m04s)

[just that we can omit all of that and do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m07s)

[it as a method group and pass it all the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m09s)

[way through](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m10s)

[let's see language is auction of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m12s)

[uh exactly one is the default](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m22s)

[i'm not there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m26s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m27s)

[return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m29s)

[jumped a little too far down](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m34s)

[uh let's see add library option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m37s)

[that's also string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m40s)

[actually let's copy this because the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m43s)

[next several are all option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m45s)

[i have a feeling we're going to be doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m48s)

[the exact same thing a few times over](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h05m50s)

[it's like that it goes like that method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m01s)

[class name option is string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m04s)

[so boom boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m07s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m10s)

[did that thing just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m10s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m16s)

[did it just do the right thing out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m26s)

[intellicode i'm about to be very very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m29s)

[impressed if you did the right thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m31s)

[you formatted it really unfortunately](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m33s)

[okay color me impressed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m46s)

[color me impressed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m49s)

[why yes intellicode](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h06m54s)

[i'm a little scared to click this now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m02s)

[i am](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m08s)

[very impressed in telecode i realize](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m09s)

[what i'm doing is highly patterning](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m11s)

[which is clearly a word but that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m17s)

[that is still just straight up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m20s)

[impressive](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m25s)

[this one it didn't match because the get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m30s)

[default value is a little different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m32s)

[that's okay i'll teach you in telecode](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m35s)

[don't worry i'll show you what i want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m38s)

[oh this is obviously the wrong type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m47s)

[because that should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m49s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m51s)

[uh let's see and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m55s)

[remapped](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h07m58s)

[oh interesting a couple of these are out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m01s)

[of order](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m02s)

[uh let's see l m](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m04s)

[n](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m07s)

[output location](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m08s)

[comes before output mode](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m14s)

[oh interesting okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m23s)

[let's see what happened here it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m25s)

[it's a little weird but um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m29s)

[option a string please](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m33s)

[option a string please](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m36s)

[okay that maps in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m47s)

[done okay intellicode would you like to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m50s)

[just write it for me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h08m53s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m00s)

[ridiculously impressed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m01s)

[method prefix to strip](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m04s)

[sorry this is a string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m08s)

[the fact that intellicode knew that was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m10s)

[a little unnerving](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m12s)

[apply suggestion](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m14s)

[intellicode i am](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m17s)

[i am impressed with you tonight you have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m20s)

[done](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m23s)

[very well if you would remember the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m24s)

[formatting and not mess it up that would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m25s)

[be even better but you know what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m27s)

[we'll take what i can get this is option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m29s)

[of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m32s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m34s)

[uh let's see this is option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h09m49s)

[and return is spelled like that for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m05s)

[those who are wondering](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m08s)

[no i cannot spell](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m10s)

[uh let's see test output location is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m13s)

[also a string so naturally intellicode](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m15s)

[wants to write the code for me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m17s)

[i am](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m21s)

[very impressed with you intellicode you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m24s)

[are showing off a lot tonight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m26s)

[just wish you wouldn't mess up my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m34s)

[formatting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m36s)

[uh okay and then this is another one of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m37s)

[these it's checking ad version option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m39s)

[mine is going to replace the other one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m46s)

[so i don't think it's going to matter](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m47s)

[we're going to get rid of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m50s)

[and in this case](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m55s)

[version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h10m57s)

[argument already zero](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m06s)

[i think we do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m13s)

[it's kind of a little weird the way it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m19s)

[it's going to want to set up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m21s)

[because this is a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m28s)

[it's treated like a flag](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m30s)

[and you need to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m35s)

[but the way system command line will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m41s)

[handle it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m44s)

[if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m46s)

[specified](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m47s)

[it will end up getting a value of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m49s)

[true](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m53s)

[bool is kind of a special case because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m55s)

[it gets used as flags in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h11m57s)

[why are you squawking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m02s)

[best overload for option does not have a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m04s)

[parameter named aliases](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m07s)

[my stupid but yes it does](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m13s)

[oh it's because of this guy down here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m20s)

[was a confusing air visual studio](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m25s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m27s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m30s)

[adversion option traverse option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m32s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m39s)

[traversal names is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m40s)

[option of string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m44s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m48s)

[one or more is defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m54s)

[clean that up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h12m57s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m06s)

[with access specified option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m07s)

[i think all of the remaining ones are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m11s)

[all going to be option of string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m13s)

[on telecode](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m16s)

[do your thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m18s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m30s)

[we're going for it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m34s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m36s)

[intellicode you are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m37s)

[utterly amazing at times](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m39s)

[utterly amazing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m43s)

[um actually i think we can probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m53s)

[we can probably regex this one now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h13m56s)

[a literal paren](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m00s)

[colon so match on that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m05s)

[replace](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m09s)

[with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m11s)

[ren](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m13s)

[backslash new line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m18s)

[alias](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m22s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m23s)

[basically i just want to insert a new](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m26s)

[line character in the middle of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m27s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m30s)

[so replace one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m31s)

[and then how much indentation do we want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m34s)

[all right yes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m40s)

[i want that many white space characters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m44s)

[it's all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m51s)

[and then if i find](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m54s)

[description](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h14m59s)

[i would like to replace that with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m05s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m11s)

[so at the end of here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m16s)

[new line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m19s)

[same number of white space lines then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m22s)

[description](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m24s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m29s)

[replace all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m30s)

[and then the last one if i find](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m33s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m38s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m41s)

[i would like to replace that with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m43s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h15m50s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m25s)

[that's a little cleaner](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m26s)

[okay now we just have all of these guys](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m31s)

[which i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m34s)

[are now all meaningless so we go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m36s)

[boom get all those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m41s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m43s)

[so now all i need is all of these types](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m44s)

[to be added](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m47s)

[here along with these names](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m49s)

[now conveniently i have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m53s)

[such a list](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m56s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m58s)

[of the types and the names so what i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h16m59s)

[really want is a set of types first](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m02s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m07s)

[match on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m10s)

[uh let's see find all characters that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m11s)

[are not white space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m18s)

[more than one repetition](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m19s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m20s)

[i guess that's word characters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m28s)

[uh let's see white spaces s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m34s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m38s)

[space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m39s)

[all right single space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m42s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m50s)

[actually what i kind of want to do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m51s)

[this instead](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m53s)

[i'm going to want to just use the groups](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m55s)

[anyway for my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h17m59s)

[actually i think i want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m03s)

[do it like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m08s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m09s)

[that's what we want to grab](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m10s)

[so the first thing we want is just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m12s)

[dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m14s)

[the come on the end i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m16s)

[place](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m19s)

[copy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m22s)

[and then that goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m25s)

[we come back here we go undo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m30s)

[and then the next thing i want is dollar](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m33s)

[sign](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m35s)

[two](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m36s)

[with a comma on the end of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m37s)

[place uh that's not what we want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m41s)

[uh technically i guess just dollar sign](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m44s)

[2 because it's going to have a comma on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m47s)

[the end](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m49s)

[so let's just do that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m50s)

[and then that becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m56s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h18m59s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m05s)

[oh and this is where we were going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m07s)

[run into problems with why i could uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m08s)

[this is why i couldn't just do a flat](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m11s)

[list because i was going to run out of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m13s)

[generic parameters](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m15s)

[doesn't that just bite](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m18s)

[doesn't that just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m38s)

[i guess that is the question](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m44s)

[of what is the easiest way to do the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m46s)

[binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m47s)

[because if you've got a large number of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m50s)

[thingies](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m52s)

[how do i want to get those in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h19m57s)

[i guess the question is so we could](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m07s)

[cache them all just the same way we do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m10s)

[the other ones and keep the logic fairly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m12s)

[similar](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m14s)

[that might be the easiest option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m18s)

[given all of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m30s)

[i'm gonna i wanna i wanna try something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m37s)

[i don't remember the magical incantation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m39s)

[that does this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m42s)

[i can't recall if this will figure it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m43s)

[out or not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m45s)

[let's see so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h20m47s)

[i want to see what that does](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m03s)

[if it will figure out that binding based](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m08s)

[upon the parameter](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m10s)

[i think it will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m13s)

[don't recall though](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m15s)

[files](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m20s)

[oh so i need to turn](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m23s)

[this back on for it to work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m27s)

[where are you where are you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m37s)

[are you in our option for parameter](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m46s)

[positions zero did you mean to pass one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m49s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m51s)

[no i meant to admit it and hope for you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m52s)

[to figure it out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m54s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h21m59s)

[in order for this to work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m01s)

[we're going to have to go the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m04s)

[doing the custom binder but i feel like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m07s)

[that's going to be the only option for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m10s)

[doing this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m11s)

[it's probably a good idea it's probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m16s)

[a good idea i just don't like it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m18s)

[okay fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m23s)

[we're gonna need to name this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m26s)

[different here at some point but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m29s)

[because my custom type just doesn't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m31s)

[really scream](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m32s)

[useful](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m34s)

[at the moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m35s)

[so this will become string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m37s)

[additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m42s)

[option i don't know what the naming](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m45s)

[scheme is in this library so we'll just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m46s)

[go in with that for the moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m48s)

[and then we're going to whack this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m51s)

[constructor](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m52s)

[and have you gen me a constructor pretty](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m54s)

[please](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m56s)

[and then this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h22m58s)

[custom pipe custom type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m00s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m04s)

[i think we're just going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m12s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m13s)

[and it will be binding context parse](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m16s)

[result get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m18s)

[value for option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m20s)

[and it will be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m24s)

[additional option boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m25s)

[boom boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m27s)

[this all goes away no one cares](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m28s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m32s)

[that means down here this becomes a new](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m36s)

[custom binder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m40s)

[and this takes in additional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m44s)

[let's try it let's try it i'm not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m51s)

[thrilled with it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m53s)

[i'm not thrilled with it it feels like a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m54s)

[lot of extra work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m56s)

[custom type](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h23m59s)

[look at that there's a string it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m00s)

[contains the one value huzzah okay well](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m02s)

[i'd much prefer to do flat binding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m13s)

[or the other option is we don't do any](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m18s)

[of this garbage and we just do it inside](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m20s)

[of here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m22s)

[this might even be easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m24s)

[because if we had this guy elevated up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m27s)

[to for example private static](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m31s)

[option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m34s)

[of string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m36s)

[uh let's see s underscore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m39s)

[additional option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m43s)

[if we did something like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m48s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m52s)

[where this guy the the same instance got](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m54s)

[assigned into here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m57s)

[right and then down in here we just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h24m59s)

[we just drop all of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m02s)

[that goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m06s)

[this comes down here this becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m10s)

[invocation context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m11s)

[and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m14s)

[i'm gonna comment this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m17s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m20s)

[this guy becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m22s)

[something more like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m25s)

[that's underscore additional option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m30s)

[and that's not a bad way of doing it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m33s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m37s)

[get value for option not value for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m42s)

[option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m44s)

[because then what we can do is if we run](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m48s)

[this again this might be easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m50s)

[all this back and forth and i may just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m53s)

[throw it away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m54s)

[oh well live and learn](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h25m57s)

[this might be easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m00s)

[because then we don't have to deal with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m05s)

[all of this stuff we just really have to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m06s)

[create ourselves a bunch of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m08s)

[which we can kind of do already](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m11s)

[undo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m16s)

[so we've got our types and names already](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m19s)

[so let's see so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m22s)

[we wanted to declare the declarations](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m24s)

[this will end up being private static](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m27s)

[option of let's see the type which is is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m32s)

[one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m37s)

[uh and then the value will be s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m39s)

[underscore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m42s)

[uh dollar sign two](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m44s)

[semicolon](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m48s)

[write me some code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m49s)

[so boom there's all those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m55s)

[oh that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h26m59s)

[hang on that picked up some commas i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m01s)

[would like to drop those commas](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m07s)

[uh hi could you show some simple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m10s)

[examples of how to use the library sure](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m12s)

[i would be happy to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m14s)

[by library i'm assuming you're talking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m15s)

[about system command line rather than](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m17s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m19s)

[clang sharp because i honestly don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m20s)

[know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m23s)

[of them there was one i was actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m25s)

[just working on last night](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m28s)

[i don't know if i would say it's the the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m31s)

[pristine example but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m32s)

[it was one i just updated so for the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m35s)

[material design library i wrote a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m37s)

[bit of automation to make my life easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m39s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m42s)

[system command line is aiming to be so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m43s)

[it's worth noting there are there's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m46s)

[couple levels to this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m47s)

[so system command line by itself is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m49s)

[aiming to be sort of that base level api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m52s)

[that makes working with command lines](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m56s)

[much easier you get a bunch of stuff out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m57s)

[of the box highly perform it it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h27m59s)

[trimmable all the latest c-sharp stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m01s)

[it's good so this is going to be showing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m04s)

[off the base level api and here uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m06s)

[link](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m11s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m12s)

[so this is using the lower level of the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m13s)

[api and it's worth calling out one piece](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m16s)

[of documentation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m19s)

[let's see if i jump back here docs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m22s)

[uh syntax concepts actually you know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m26s)

[what why am i doing this i just wrote a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m30s)

[blog on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m32s)

[i just wrote a blog on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m33s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m36s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m39s)

[i wrote a a small getting started guide](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m40s)

[for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m43s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m45s)

[uh yes so the the things to to note is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m47s)

[this is going to be calling out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m51s)

[the base level api at the very beginning](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m53s)

[of how to build it out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m56s)

[so the the things to note here is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h28m57s)

[for a command line you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m01s)

[you want to avoid having to parse this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m03s)

[string args yourself because there's so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m04s)

[many different ways that a caller could](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m07s)

[say just invert the order of arguments](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m09s)

[that you then have to try to deal with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m11s)

[it is a major pain there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m13s)

[subtlety there especially if you want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m15s)

[have something that that really works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m16s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m18s)

[so the the the first step is to lay out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m20s)

[what is often referred to as like the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m23s)

[grammar of your cli](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m24s)

[your command line of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m27s)

[in my case i have multiple commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m29s)

[and each of these commands has different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m32s)

[things that are on it so you'll note](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m35s)

[this command here is diff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m37s)

[icons so when i run this what i actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m39s)

[type is github helper space diff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m42s)

[space icons and then icons takes a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m45s)

[couple things two versions and then what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m48s)

[this ends up doing is generating me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m50s)

[i'll just show you the output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m55s)

[um in the wiki](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h29m57s)

[for material design](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m01s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m04s)

[pack icon changes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m04s)

[so all of these guys in here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m06s)

[this output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m10s)

[is um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m12s)

[is coming from this tool just so because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m14s)

[i didn't want to deal with trying to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m17s)

[figure out what icons changed from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m18s)

[version to version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m20s)

[i have a little tool that just downloads](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m21s)

[both of the versions does the diff and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m23s)

[then gens it out for me because i'm way](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m26s)

[too lazy to figure all that out myself](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m28s)

[but from a command line syntax what that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m33s)

[ends up doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m37s)

[back to here what that ends up looking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m38s)

[like is a couple commands for that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m40s)

[nested command syntax and if you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m43s)

[familiar with the the.net sdk you'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m45s)

[note like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m48s)

[dot net is the root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m50s)

[and run is a sub command of net](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m52s)

[and there's like dot net build which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m55s)

[would be another example as well](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h30m57s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m00s)

[little things that come after it the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m01s)

[things that people will call switches or](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m03s)

[flags um these are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m04s)

[um referred to as options and an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m07s)

[may have an argument and as the name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m11s)

[implies options are optional](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m13s)

[so you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m18s)

[uh you don't necessarily require them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m19s)

[per se though you could add validation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m22s)

[that makes them required if that is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m24s)

[desirable](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m26s)

[um so you set up your commands the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m28s)

[commands typically take in either an](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m31s)

[argument themselves or or some set of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m34s)

[options you can just um add to them with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m36s)

[the same way like you would build up a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m40s)

[list](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m42s)

[with the object initializer syntax you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m43s)

[can do the same thing here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m45s)

[which works great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m47s)

[and then this set handler](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m48s)

[you'll note the one thing that's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m50s)

[little weird about this is even though](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m52s)

[my command takes in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m53s)

[two options that are strings](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m55s)

[my handler actually takes in a third](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h31m58s)

[parameter which is this i consoled](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m00s)

[there's a small set of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m02s)

[well-known types built into the library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m05s)

[this is not dependency injection](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m07s)

[it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m09s)

[um it's a basically a dictionary lookup](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m10s)

[it's just a small set of things but if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m14s)

[we look at the diff icons method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m16s)

[you'll note it takes in this i console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m20s)

[and two strings and the nice part is i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m22s)

[don't have to think about somebody](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m24s)

[invoking my command line argument and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m26s)

[figuring out how to get down to here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m29s)

[because i built up my grammar for my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m31s)

[command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m33s)

[if i jump up here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m35s)

[when i call invoke async system commit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m37s)

[because i i do invoke a sync and i pass](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m40s)

[in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m42s)

[um telling it hey here are the commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m43s)

[that i know how to handle and so when](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m45s)

[somebody calls it on the command line it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m47s)

[figures out oh did they call something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m49s)

[correctly if they did okay let's invoke](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m51s)

[its handler if they didn't you know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m53s)

[let's give them a nice air show them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m56s)

[help there's like typo correction so if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h32m57s)

[you get close to being correct but you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m00s)

[miss it by a couple characters you might](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m02s)

[have seen this like with the azure cli](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m04s)

[where it'll say hey did you actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m06s)

[mean to type x it's like oh yes that's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m07s)

[exactly what it meant thank you um it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m10s)

[got all this use default tacks on a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m13s)

[whole bunch of useful stuff like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m15s)

[just out of the gate](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m16s)

[it can also do the the auto completion](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m18s)

[for tab like you might see but that is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m20s)

[an opt-in feature there's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m23s)

[i'll show you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m27s)

[there it actually on my blog i think i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m28s)

[called it out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m30s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m32s)

[tab completion yes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m34s)

[there is a small bit that you have to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m38s)

[to actually enable tab completion](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m40s)

[depending on what shell you're in so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m42s)

[there is a little shim script that you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m44s)

[have to add to your profile](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m45s)

[but then once you do that all apps built](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m47s)

[with system command line magically get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m51s)

[tab completion so this is an opt-in once](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m53s)

[on your shell but then all apps that use](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m56s)

[this library will all get that for free](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h33m58s)

[which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m04s)

[and then you just call invoke async now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m06s)

[this is pretty good](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m08s)

[ish](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m12s)

[but there is i don't know what is that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m13s)

[line 21 through](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m15s)

[i don't know all the way to 73 that's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m18s)

[like 50 lines of boilerplate code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m20s)

[we can do better](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m23s)

[we can do better so but again this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m24s)

[the the base level api that aims to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m27s)

[functional and usable and good](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m33s)

[but everybody has opinions about what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m34s)

[would make](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m36s)

[a good api and how to make this better](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m37s)

[right people have people have built all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m39s)

[kinds of cli libraries that that make](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m41s)

[things uh better for this and system](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m44s)

[command line would refer to those as](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m46s)

[like the flavor of the day or flavors so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m48s)

[the idea is that people should be able](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m51s)

[to build on top of this api to add in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m54s)

[whatever opinions that they want right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m56s)

[some people like declaring a poco with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h34m58s)

[some attributes some people like a more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m00s)

[fluent syntax](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m02s)

[people will write all kinds of extension](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m04s)

[methods and whatnot great make whatever](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m05s)

[flavor you want build it on top of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m08s)

[the base library should give you all of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m10s)

[that power and functionality and let you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m11s)

[build your flavors and get out of your](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m13s)

[way](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m16s)

[um that way people who want to take a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m16s)

[stronger opinion on how things should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m19s)

[done can do so and then people can pick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m22s)

[which of those flavors that they like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m24s)

[one flavor that is in the box](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m26s)

[well in the box it's a separate nougat](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m30s)

[package but one one flavor that the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m32s)

[system command line library produced](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m35s)

[just as a way of showing it is something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m37s)

[like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m39s)

[so you add the system command line dot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m41s)

[dragon fruit nougat package](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m44s)

[and then you rather than having your](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m47s)

[main method be string array args](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m48s)

[you just type in the types that you want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m51s)

[and you're done](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m55s)

[which is pretty slick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m57s)

[so then what dragon fruit ends up doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h35m59s)

[behind the scenes is it generates you a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m01s)

[main method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m03s)

[and then it goes looking for your other](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m05s)

[main method and goes okay now that i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m07s)

[found your other main method i can see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m09s)

[that you want an option of type int i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m11s)

[want its default value to be 42 and etc](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m13s)

[etc etc](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m16s)

[and so then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m17s)

[you don't have to do anything else you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m19s)

[just type you create a strongly typed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m20s)

[main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m22s)

[and you're done](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m24s)

[and that's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m26s)

[this is in my opinion is about as stupid](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m27s)

[simple as you can possibly make it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m30s)

[now the problem with this is it's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m33s)

[little limiting because it's simple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m35s)

[things like what i was doing here with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m37s)

[the the nested commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m40s)

[or sub commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m42s)

[is not possible dragon fruit will not do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m44s)

[sub commands it'll only do a root](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m47s)

[command with some options so if all i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m49s)

[wanted was this command with some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m52s)

[options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m54s)

[it would be great for that the moment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m55s)

[you want to do sub commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m57s)

[dragon fruit just can't do it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h36m59s)

[so there there's a couple other flavors](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m02s)

[that are being worked on that aim to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m04s)

[to have this level of simplicity but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m07s)

[more power](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m09s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m10s)

[and obviously the community is more than](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m12s)

[welcome to build anything that they want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m14s)

[but these are the types of things where](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m16s)

[people are likely to have opinions about](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m18s)

[how](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m20s)

[how it should work but if you're looking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m21s)

[to build a stupid simple command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m22s)

[app](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m25s)

[dragon fruit is awesome](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m26s)

[i built a couple with it and it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m29s)

[it is so nice so nice you just you write](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m31s)

[your main method you include your nuget](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m35s)

[package and then you walk away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m36s)

[and there's nothing nothing to think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m39s)

[about the other thing that it does is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m40s)

[if you turn on xml comments](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m43s)

[it will actually use these xml comments](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m46s)

[if somebody does like dash dash help or](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m48s)

[dash h on the end of it it'll gen up the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m50s)

[the help output for you so you can see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m54s)

[the default help isn't great but the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m56s)

[moment you put these xml docs on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h37m58s)

[it will now pull those in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m01s)

[and read those for your output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m04s)

[so worth noting these xml docs are then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m07s)

[not necessarily xml docs that are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m09s)

[targeted at your](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m11s)

[at programmers using your api but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m13s)

[generally programmers are if you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m16s)

[producing something like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m18s)

[programmers aren't invoking your main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m19s)

[method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m21s)

[generally](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m23s)

[and then all of this ends up just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m26s)

[working](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m28s)

[and there's a there's a few other small](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m29s)

[convention things with like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m30s)

[args and other things for getting passed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m32s)

[in like um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m35s)

[again the idea that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m37s)

[uh an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m39s)

[can ha is optional sometimes this this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m40s)

[args can bring it in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m44s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m46s)

[so yeah if you're looking for an easy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m47s)

[way to get started especially if you go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m48s)

[to build a command line app i've had](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m51s)

[some colleagues that had to build some](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m53s)

[cli apps](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m54s)

[recently and i was like you can use any](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m56s)

[library you want as long as you pick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m57s)

[system command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h38m59s)

[i'm not picky](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m00s)

[once they were done laughing they're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m02s)

[like okay show me how this thing works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m03s)

[and and so far it's been a good](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m06s)

[experience each time](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m07s)

[i don't know if any of my colleagues are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m10s)

[in the chat to refute that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m11s)

[but probably not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m14s)

[as far as i can tell it's been a good](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m16s)

[experience](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m18s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m19s)

[so but that is the library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m21s)

[that is what we are trying to get over](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m24s)

[to here but the unfortunate part is this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m26s)

[is a somewhat complicated cli app](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m29s)

[but i think going down this route](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m32s)

[is probably easy enough](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m36s)

[all right we were going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m40s)

[the commas](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m42s)

[so i want to match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m44s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m51s)

[and i want to just put i want to pick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m52s)

[the comma up outside of it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m53s)

[there that'll work better](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m56s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m58s)

[okay and then paste](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h39m59s)

[and that just all worked](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m03s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m07s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m08s)

[okay we're gonna leave that there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m13s)

[because that's just a really useful](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m14s)

[thing um and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m15s)

[all of you need to get assigned](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m18s)

[i think all of these are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m24s)

[here so let's grab this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m28s)

[we're going to just grab this and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m32s)

[i'm back i think i still have this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m35s)

[excellent](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m39s)

[we're gonna actually bring this in like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m40s)

[this okay so on this one what we want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m42s)

[match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m46s)

[let's see so s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m48s)

[some number of repetitions var](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m52s)

[space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m55s)

[and then we're going to go with not s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h40m57s)

[repeating](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m01s)

[to pick up the name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m03s)

[base equals space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m05s)

[and then i think we can just go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m08s)

[end of line and pick up the rest of it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m12s)

[and then this will end up being](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m17s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m21s)

[uh s underscore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m22s)

[dollar sign one equals](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m24s)

[dollar sign two i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m28s)

[it looks pretty close to right let me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m34s)

[just double check](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m42s)

[i'm noticing there's a slight disjoint](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m48s)

[here in the naming](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m50s)

[hi veyhoy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m56s)

[yeah we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h41m58s)

[we're gonna go with it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m02s)

[because even though like s config is not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m03s)

[quite gonna line up we'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m06s)

[we're gonna paste it and then we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m08s)

[gonna chase down whatever errors are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m09s)

[left](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m11s)

[this is going to go like this this var](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m14s)

[additional is going to go away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m16s)

[this is going to change into](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m18s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m22s)

[okay and then obviously that's not right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m24s)

[okay so s config should end up being](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m28s)

[config switches](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m33s)

[i think this is actually supposed to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m35s)

[config option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m36s)

[yeah whatever we're gonna keep we're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m44s)

[gonna keep going](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m49s)

[actually let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m50s)

[let's bring this one down since i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m52s)

[this one's obvious](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m54s)

[that's config options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h42m57s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h43m32s)

[oh i i guess i could have figured out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h43m34s)

[that that was the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h43m36s)

[that was the included directory](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h43m39s)

[i wonder why that was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m02s)

[huh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m06s)

[that one got messed up that may have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m08s)

[been a typo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m10s)

[i am seriously shocked this thing is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m13s)

[just eating this alive](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m15s)

[kind of happy that this thing is just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m37s)

[auto coding for me it's almost like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m39s)

[sounds like it could replace me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m44s)

[the nice part is with all the analyzers](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m51s)

[that are turned on on this project if i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m53s)

[miss something i'm pretty sure it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m55s)

[going to yell at me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m56s)

[okay so that handled all of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h44m58s)

[great next let's just grab all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m00s)

[we're going to take these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m06s)

[go back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m08s)

[we're going to do some more auto coding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m09s)

[okay so once again we are going to match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m13s)

[on this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m15s)

[we are going to grab](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m17s)

[let's see so rather than that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m19s)

[this is going to end up being s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m21s)

[underscore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m24s)

[not s](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m26s)

[something equals end of line and so this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m28s)

[will end up being](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m31s)

[dollar sign one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m33s)

[comma](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m36s)

[i believe](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m37s)

[yep](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m39s)

[regex coding is so much fun](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m42s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m44s)

[oh actually i probably wanted to indent](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m46s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m47s)

[let's go back and fix that indentation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m49s)

[let's indent all of those like that so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m53s)

[undo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m55s)

[redo copy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h45m56s)

[undo paste there we are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m00s)

[clean that up oh the first one's too far](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m03s)

[back you up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m06s)

[okay so that gets it all in there that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m09s)

[gets it all in there now all we have to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m11s)

[do is come in here and pull these things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m13s)

[back out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m16s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m18s)

[given our set of stuff here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m20s)

[should be able to copy this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m24s)

[that's a good question how do i want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m30s)

[do this because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m32s)

[i kind of want to keep](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m33s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m42s)

[i'm almost going to need to just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m45s)

[well let's let's let's do it like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m47s)

[i think i actually want to keep most of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m51s)

[these local variables](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h46m52s)

[replace this with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h47m54s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m01s)

[and then i think the next thing we want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m03s)

[is we want to change](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m06s)

[that to get value for options so we are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m08s)

[going to match on value for option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m11s)

[and replace with get value for option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h48m14s)

[working](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m40s)

[drop that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m42s)

[just be in vocation context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m44s)

[you're gone](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m48s)

[you're gone](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m52s)

[you're cleaner](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m54s)

[your cleaner and we're just going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m58s)

[whack](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h52m59s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m01s)

[clean that up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m04s)

[okay so now most of this should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m08s)

[working aside from the i think the help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m10s)

[stuff that we left commented](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m12s)

[out okay so we have a help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m24s)

[and normally this thing would come from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m31s)

[this help context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m36s)

[so let's see what is this thing doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m39s)

[it's interesting this thing is doing a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m44s)

[help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m47s)

[but then just calling help builder right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m49s)

[line did this one you did its right line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m51s)

[used to do anything fancy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m54s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h53m59s)

[was just shelling out okay so this is so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m00s)

[we don't actually need the help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m03s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m04s)

[we don't actually need the help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m10s)

[what we what we actually want here is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m12s)

[just to write out some output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m14s)

[so we can do this this is just going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m16s)

[be context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m18s)

[uh dot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m21s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m23s)

[and do that and then we don't need this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m25s)

[help builder at all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m27s)

[that's a little easier](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m30s)

[i think so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m32s)

[uh in case you missed it genesis feel](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m35s)

[free to drop your question in the chat](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m36s)

[if you want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m38s)

[happy to take a look](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m40s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m42s)

[and then this is a bunch of stuff bunch](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m46s)

[of stuff a bunch of stuff bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m48s)

[a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m51s)

[this was help builder right and right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m54s)

[line and this was passing in an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m56s)

[so let's look here because i think](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h54m59s)

[so this was calling right passing a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m08s)

[string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m11s)

[just double check this because this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m14s)

[yeah so this was just call](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m24s)

[this right of an option wasn't doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m27s)

[much](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m29s)

[it was a convenient way of writing out a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m31s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m34s)

[this just becomes an option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m38s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m42s)

[this i think becomes a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m43s)

[let's see because that was looking to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m54s)

[take in a command but i don't think we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m56s)

[actually want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h55m58s)

[i don't think we necessarily want any of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m07s)

[those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m09s)

[because this was literally just doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m13s)

[console out in both cases](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m15s)

[i wonder how many there's three](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m20s)

[references](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m22s)

[oh and then these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m25s)

[because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m28s)

[let's see what is this doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m29s)

[that is option of string array](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m32s)

[s config options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m35s)

[oh there was a config option and a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m38s)

[config options oh boy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m40s)

[oh boy did i did i make a mistake](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m43s)

[there is a very real possibility i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m47s)

[bought something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m50s)

[um i wonder if i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m56s)

[botched that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h56m58s)

[i might need to go back and look at that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m00s)

[again because that is a little different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m02s)

[but i once again don't think that we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m04s)

[need the help builder for this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m07s)

[so this is looking to write out the the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m13s)

[root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m16s)

[because this writing of the option isn't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m17s)

[actually doing anything](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m20s)

[overly useful it's just joining together](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m24s)

[all the aliases tab character](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m27s)

[description new line character](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m29s)

[this feels like something that should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m33s)

[an extension on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m38s)

[i console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m41s)

[rather than something on the help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m43s)

[builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m44s)

[we're gonna leave we're gonna put that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m48s)

[there and then let's look at this one so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m50s)

[this one here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m51s)

[is a similar situation except for this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m52s)

[one's looking to write](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m54s)

[this one is spewing out a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h57m58s)

[and is looking to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m08s)

[and it's looking to write that out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m13s)

[so i mean we can kind of cheat a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m16s)

[bit with this because we do know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m24s)

[i thought i saw a second](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m26s)

[yeah there's an extension here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m34s)

[where's this extension](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m48s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m53s)

[this is kind of what i want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h58m54s)

[yeah so let's go with that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m00s)

[so if i come back in here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m04s)

[do one of these maneuvers using](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m07s)

[let's see system command line a b c d f](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m11s)

[g h](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m14s)

[and then we come down here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m17s)

[where that g is and then this becomes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m20s)

[on text dot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m25s)

[out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m31s)

[oh that's wanting a text writer though](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m43s)

[that's gonna be i've got a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m45s)

[bit of a mismatch there now don't i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m48s)

[because that's the old one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m53s)

[what goes into the help context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=01h59m56s)

[text writer output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m03s)

[and how do we get down to this text](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m06s)

[writer what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m08s)

[i'm missing i'm missing something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m10s)

[obvious here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m12s)

[how do you get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m14s)

[how do you get down into that what does](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m19s)

[your implementation look like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m20s)

[how do we get down to it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m30s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m33s)

[do you think there are async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m37s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m38s)

[you think there are async commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m39s)

[attached to buttons in the application](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m40s)

[there are a lot of them should such](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m43s)

[commands](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m44s)

[be all spam proof by default user](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m45s)

[repeatedly clicks on the button](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m48s)

[execution crash often do you protect](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m49s)

[your projects protection is a double](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m52s)

[check with semaphore is loading weight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m54s)

[async is loading](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m56s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h00m58s)

[that's a very good question](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m04s)

[let me think because i've run into this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m07s)

[now on on a couple projects that we've](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m09s)

[handled it in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m11s)

[somewhat different ways](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m13s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m15s)

[if you put in protection there are a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m18s)

[couple ways to go about doing it because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m20s)

[sometimes like the the idea with uh like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m22s)

[an is loading](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m26s)

[um type situation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m27s)

[is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m30s)

[that assumes that you want all the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m32s)

[clicks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m33s)

[if those are relevant](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m35s)

[often what i have found is with a lot of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m37s)

[ui events if something's in progress](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m39s)

[i don't actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m43s)

[i don't actually care about those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m46s)

[duplicate clicks so the the technical](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m48s)

[term is debounce so if like multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m50s)

[click click click click come in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m53s)

[like for example if it's like say a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m56s)

[paging control and there's you know next](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m58s)

[and previous pages if somebody mashes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h01m59s)

[that next next thing like a bunch of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m02s)

[times i probably don't care](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m04s)

[i probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m07s)

[first click goes through all subsequent](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m09s)

[quicks while loading is going](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m11s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m13s)

[end up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m14s)

[just getting dropped](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m16s)

[and oftentimes what i will use for that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m18s)

[rather than like a semaphore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m21s)

[is the interlocked class so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m22s)

[just watch them and end up leaving this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m28s)

[code in here and getting critiqued on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m30s)

[um so for example uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m32s)

[private](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m35s)

[a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m36s)

[sync](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m38s)

[ask](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m40s)

[boo right so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m42s)

[you've gotta you've got a handler looks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m43s)

[kind of like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m47s)

[oh my word they have a lot of rules in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m48s)

[this project](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m50s)

[uh lacks in a wait](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m52s)

[wait task](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m54s)

[delay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m55s)

[one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m57s)

[uh and start messing up the data yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h02m59s)

[several threads enter the mess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m02s)

[so so yeah there's a couple ways to go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m04s)

[about doing it your your semaphore is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m06s)

[one option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m08s)

[one of the ways that i like to do my](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m09s)

[debounce looks kind of like this um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m11s)

[is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m15s)

[running](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m16s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m18s)

[the the only thing with things like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m20s)

[semaphores and locking and similar is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m21s)

[you can run into a situation where](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m24s)

[it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m26s)

[like that adds a little bit of overhead](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m28s)

[to do that locking and back and forth](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m31s)

[and oftentimes you want button clicks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m33s)

[running running fairly quickly so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m35s)

[the the thing to remember is with async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m37s)

[methods](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m40s)

[they are going especially like click](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m41s)

[handlers](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m43s)

[when you hit this very first opening](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m44s)

[curly brace you're going to be on the ui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m46s)

[thread because that came in from the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m48s)

[button](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m49s)

[so you will not be transitioning off of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m51s)

[the ui thread until you hit your first](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m54s)

[await](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m56s)

[so what you can do is something like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m58s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h03m59s)

[uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m00s)

[interlocked](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m06s)

[and then i will do something like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m07s)

[compare exchange](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m08s)

[breath](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m11s)

[is running](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m12s)

[so did it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m14s)

[yeah that's kind of like exactly what i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m17s)

[want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m20s)

[uh if protected by a semaphore is it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m23s)

[possible to push](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m25s)

[push through it afterwards yes so if you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m27s)

[do something with like a semaphore slim](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m29s)

[where you do a weight async what that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m31s)

[will end up doing so if you use a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m33s)

[semaphore that has a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m37s)

[an initial and a max count of one that's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m39s)

[basically the the async version of the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m42s)

[the c sharp lock keyword so you'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m45s)

[you'll end up if a bunch of threads come](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m47s)

[in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m49s)

[only one of them is going to be able to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m50s)

[acquire that semaphore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m52s)

[and because there's only one possible](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m54s)

[allowed only one gets to run and then um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h04m59s)

[and then back through](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m00s)

[if protected by a semaphore can we then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m02s)

[push through the cancellation token](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m04s)

[you can send through a cancellation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m07s)

[token to your uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m09s)

[and so i you you say semaphore but i i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m12s)

[assuming the class that you're actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m15s)

[using um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m16s)

[uh semaphore slim](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m18s)

[which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m21s)

[this is probably what you want rather](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m22s)

[than a full semaphore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m24s)

[especially if what you're looking for is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m26s)

[just like async locking it's a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m28s)

[bit lighter weight it's not nearly as](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m29s)

[heavy as the full semaphore class](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m32s)

[but this guy's uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m35s)

[so you typically do something like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m37s)

[initial max count](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m40s)

[and then on here some of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m42s)

[semaphore slim](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m45s)

[uh weight async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m47s)

[and then this guy has a cancellation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m49s)

[token](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m51s)

[right so you can pretend like this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m54s)

[this is backed by something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m56s)

[something useful if you want to cancel](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m57s)

[it the thing with the the cancellation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h05m59s)

[token that you have to be careful with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m01s)

[though](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m03s)

[is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m04s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m05s)

[this will end up throwing an operation](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m07s)

[cancelled exception or a task cancelled](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m09s)

[exception depending on the api](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m10s)

[and so you will often want to trap that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m13s)

[and throw it away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m16s)

[so oftentimes you will see code that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m18s)

[ends up looking like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m20s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m24s)

[specifically for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m28s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m29s)

[that type of thing and you know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m31s)

[do async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m34s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m36s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m38s)

[somewhere down here you have a finally](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m39s)

[that looks something like semaphore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m42s)

[semaphore slim release](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m45s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m49s)

[this kind of pattern is fairly common if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m50s)

[what you're looking to do is an async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m53s)

[operation and you want to ensure that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m55s)

[only one ever gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h06m57s)

[through at a time what are you squawking](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m00s)

[about](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m01s)

[makefield oh my word](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m02s)

[expression value is never used i know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m05s)

[it's never used wow the analyzers on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m07s)

[this project are really really picky](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m09s)

[that's good but really picky so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m13s)

[something akin to this it would be one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m16s)

[way](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m18s)

[the the interlock compare exchange i i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m19s)

[enjoy using as a way of debouncing if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m22s)

[you don't care about every click](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m24s)

[because what you can do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m28s)

[interlocked](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m31s)

[exchange ref](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m33s)

[is running](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m36s)

[and i need to make sure i didn't get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m38s)

[these backwards so it compares value](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m40s)

[uh so it compares with zero](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m43s)

[and if it is zero replaces it with one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m47s)

[oh so i want this to go back to zero](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m50s)

[oh hush](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h07m58s)

[so interlock compare exchange compares](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m00s)

[the current value with the compare end](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m02s)

[with zero if it is zero replaces with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m04s)

[one and returns the first value of zero](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m06s)

[so something like this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m08s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m12s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m15s)

[a sync work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m16s)

[this is another pattern that i use a lot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m18s)

[for and i always have to go back through](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m20s)

[the parameters for compare exchange](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m22s)

[because i can never keep them straight](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m23s)

[but what this will do is rather than](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m25s)

[having everyone block if multiple clicks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m28s)

[come through this just drops them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m31s)

[and the interlock class these methods on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m35s)

[here are guaranteed atomic so normally](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m37s)

[doing a comparison against a field](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m40s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m43s)

[okay if that comparison is true then do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m44s)

[an assignment that's normally multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m46s)

[operations which means if multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m48s)

[threads are coming into play you have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m50s)

[the issue of well i read the value but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m52s)

[then another thread changed it and back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m54s)

[and forth that could be a mess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m55s)

[because compare exchange is atomic](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h08m57s)

[you can actually guarantee that no other](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m00s)

[thread is going to muck with is running](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m02s)

[between invocations](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m04s)

[which is slick because now you can avoid](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m06s)

[doing any locking whatsoever but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m09s)

[guarantee that only one thread at a time](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m12s)

[gets inside of this now it does mean](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m14s)

[that if a one thread is busy running and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m16s)

[a second one comes in that second one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m19s)

[just that click gets dropped](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m21s)

[but again a lot of times i found that i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m23s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m25s)

[that i don't know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m29s)

[that i don't actually care if if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m30s)

[multiple clicks get dropped](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m32s)

[is it okay to put a weight test delay in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m34s)

[an asynchronous method since there is no](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m36s)

[other asynchronous code um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m38s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m41s)

[i would generally say no so the the so a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m43s)

[couple things so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m47s)

[task.delay of zero is actually hard](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m49s)

[coded to be identical to away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m52s)

[task completed task so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m58s)

[it depends on what you want the method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h09m59s)

[to do when it hits the await](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m04s)

[a while back i did a stream on async and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m05s)

[wait stuff in wpf](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m08s)

[the key thing to note is just because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m10s)

[you hit an awake keyword doesn't mean](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m12s)

[you're going to be on a different thread](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m14s)

[because for example when it hits like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m17s)

[this task await task completed task](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m20s)

[the tpl](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m23s)

[it is it is expensive to switch to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m26s)

[another thread and come back that adds](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m29s)

[overhead](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m31s)

[so there is a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m32s)

[an early uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m34s)

[an early exit i guess condition inside](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m36s)

[of this await that says hey if the task](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m40s)

[is already done](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m42s)

[don't bother to do all the thread](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m44s)

[switching](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m46s)

[just continue on synchronously](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m47s)

[so even though this is an async method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m50s)

[within a weight here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m52s)

[ignore this up here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m54s)

[even though this looks like an async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m58s)

[method this method will run](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h10m59s)

[synchronously](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m01s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m04s)

[if you do something like this you will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m06s)

[end up just running synchronously now if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m08s)

[your goal is to have an await and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m10s)

[actually get it onto a background thread](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m12s)

[an easier way to do it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m14s)

[uh task.yield](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m17s)

[so this effectively says okay when i hit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m23s)

[actually go through the asynchronous](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m24s)

[bits](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m26s)

[shell off to another thread register a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m27s)

[callback i'm going to give up my thread](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m29s)

[running and let someone else go hence](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m32s)

[the yield so it's like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m34s)

[i'm going to do something asynchronous](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m36s)

[trust me i know this looks synchronous](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m38s)

[i'll give up my thread you know and i'll](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m41s)

[take the next one that's available](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m43s)

[you know it may be the same one it may](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m45s)

[be something different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m47s)

[this would be one way to push it the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m48s)

[other option is if you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m50s)

[if you don't have any asynchronous code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m53s)

[but you still need it to look like an](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m55s)

[async method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m57s)

[another option is just drop the async](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h11m59s)

[altogether because the async keyword is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m02s)

[actually not part of your method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m04s)

[signature](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m06s)

[so you can drop the async keyword](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m09s)

[and then just write code inside of here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m12s)

[as though this was a regular method now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m15s)

[what will probably end up needing to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m17s)

[happen is at the end of the method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m19s)

[you're going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m21s)

[need to return a task but the easiest](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m22s)

[thing to do is either just return tasks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m24s)

[complete a task](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m27s)

[or if you have like task of t you can do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m28s)

[return](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m31s)

[task](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m33s)

[from result](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m34s)

[like for example if this was a a task of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m35s)

[int](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m38s)

[for example](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m39s)

[you could end up just doing task from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m42s)

[result and then you can have a method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m43s)

[that looks asynchronous but it's but if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m45s)

[there is no asynchronous code in there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m48s)

[you don't actually need the async and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m50s)

[you don't actually need the await](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m52s)

[this is actually probably the solution](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m55s)

[that you want to use](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h12m58s)

[the when you put the async keyword on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m00s)

[your method that actually tells the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m03s)

[compiler okay rewrite this method to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m05s)

[have this fancy state machine inside of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m07s)

[it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m09s)

[so that it can do all of the asynchrony](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m10s)

[bits](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m12s)

[well that state machine adds a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m13s)

[bit of overhead](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m15s)

[so if you aren't doing any asynchronous](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m16s)

[stuff it's usually better to just drop](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m19s)

[the async keyword](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m22s)

[and just return a task directly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m23s)

[depends on what you're doing but this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m27s)

[but generally](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m29s)

[if you don't need the async keyword i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m31s)

[would tell you drop it and just either](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m33s)

[return task complete a task or task from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m35s)

[result depending on whether you need a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m37s)

[return value or not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m39s)

[those are probably your better options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m42s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h13m49s)

[heck system command line actually did](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m02s)

[its help help output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m07s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m15s)

[question are you planning to port the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m16s)

[material design toolkit to net maui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m18s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m22s)

[that's a bit of a loaded question so on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m24s)

[one hand the answer is no on the other](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m26s)

[hand the answer is kind of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m28s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m30s)

[because maui can target multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m31s)

[platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m33s)

[um it's not overly useful for me to port](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m35s)

[the toolkit for the mobile side of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m38s)

[things for ios and android because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m41s)

[xamarin already has their](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m45s)

[what are they called the visuals](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m47s)

[that you can specify in your xaml for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m50s)

[for that to give you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m52s)

[a material design look and feel](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m54s)

[um so at least in terms of if you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m57s)

[just looking to get the material design](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h14m59s)

[look into your app](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m01s)

[the xamarin stuff and by virtue maui has](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m03s)

[a lot of it there now not neces there's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m07s)

[not 100 overlap between the two there's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m09s)

[like extra controls that are in the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m12s)

[material design toolkit that aren't in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m13s)

[maui and they've done some changes that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m14s)

[may not match and back and forth so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m17s)

[there's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m18s)

[a little bit there um the part that is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m19s)

[sort of yes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m21s)

[is um i'm very much interested in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m23s)

[potentially pursuing a port for uh win](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m27s)

[ui 3](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m30s)

[which is the desktop](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m31s)

[head](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m33s)

[of um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m34s)

[the the desktop head of maui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m37s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m40s)

[that i am interested in doing the hard](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m41s)

[part is when ui3 is kind of dragging a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m43s)

[little bit and getting released](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m45s)

[um i forget i think they're up to like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m47s)

[rc3](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m49s)

[or c4 or something like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m50s)

[at this point so it's getting close](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m53s)

[and this is once again microsoft saying](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m55s)

[yes this is going to be the next big](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h15m57s)

[desktop platform so i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m00s)

[i'm dragging my feet a little bit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m02s)

[because it's a big investment of time](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m04s)

[and i'd kind of like to be sure of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m06s)

[adoption before i i jump on that but i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m08s)

[mean there's the catch 22. if you don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m11s)

[do it will there be adoption](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m13s)

[and if you're waiting for adoption to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m16s)

[it you get the little bit of back and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m17s)

[forth so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m19s)

[part of me is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m21s)

[wanting to do it too as a a way of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m22s)

[making sure i learn win ui three](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m24s)

[um like to have a consistent ui across](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m27s)

[platforms and the same code base](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m30s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m34s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m36s)

[and if you are looking for a consistent](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m37s)

[ui across all platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m39s)

[so it's a little bit of a catch-22 there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m44s)

[as well so the visual is part of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m47s)

[xamarin's way of getting you that common](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m50s)

[ui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m52s)

[except for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m53s)

[and i'm i'm hesitant so common and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m56s)

[consistent ui aren't always necessarily](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h16m58s)

[the same thing sometimes people want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m00s)

[a consistent ui that has native controls](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m03s)

[so for example you know a checkbox on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m05s)

[windows the the toggle on ios and the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m07s)

[little like slide toggle thing on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m10s)

[android right those are functionally the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m12s)

[same control but they look very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m15s)

[different on the different platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m16s)

[and so that is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m18s)

[when i hear consistent ui that's often](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m20s)

[what i end up thinking of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m22s)

[but it sounds a little bit like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m24s)

[potentially you're looking for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m28s)

[common ui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m30s)

[across all platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m32s)

[um the other thing that may be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m34s)

[interesting to look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m36s)

[is the uno platform i don't know if](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m39s)

[you're familiar with that they have they](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m42s)

[they adopt a slightly different uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m45s)

[approach as well](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m49s)

[they are a little different than yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m52s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h17m59s)

[so this the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m02s)

[the uno platform very much adopts the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m04s)

[idea of a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m07s)

[um a common ui across all platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m09s)

[which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m13s)

[is pretty nice in a lot of cases you you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m14s)

[write it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m18s)

[um it wants same look and feel across](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m19s)

[all platforms with the sony codebase yes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m21s)

[yeah so common ui definitely um i would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m23s)

[tell you to potentially take a look at](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m26s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m28s)

[the uno platform because even on maui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m29s)

[even if everything reported you won't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m32s)

[end up getting a common ui in most cases](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m35s)

[and that comes down to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m38s)

[a little bit of the philosophical](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m40s)

[differences between](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m44s)

[the the xamarin approach](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m47s)

[of being able to have a native control](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m48s)

[in both clay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m50s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m51s)

[versus](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m52s)

[a common ui look and feel](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m53s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m56s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h18m59s)

[and i've heard it so thank you i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m00s)

[appreciate the feedback on the toolkit](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m02s)

[currently it's just wpf it would be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m05s)

[every additional platform would be a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m08s)

[massive undertaking because they are all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m10s)

[very different in how they do the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m12s)

[rendering](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m14s)

[but like i said the wind ui 3 is the one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m16s)

[that i think i'm most likely to jump on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m18s)

[next](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m21s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m22s)

[it does it does also add a huge](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m24s)

[maintenance cost because now you're](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m26s)

[maintaining a code base for multiple](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m27s)

[platforms and there's not exactly shared](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m29s)

[logic between them even though it's all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m31s)

[xaml like there's even there's different](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m34s)

[versions of xaml between them so wpf is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m36s)

[stuck on the oldie version of xaml](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m39s)

[whereas like uno and win ui 3 are on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m41s)

[newer version of xaml that has things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m44s)

[like xbind and generics and all kinds of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m46s)

[other happy stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m51s)

[not to say it's bad but um i would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m52s)

[probably tell you to uh to check out the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m54s)

[uno platform](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m57s)

[especially if that common ui is what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h19m58s)

[you're going for it will probably get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m00s)

[you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m02s)

[a lot closer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m03s)

[um because then you can have one code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m05s)

[base they also let you target a a large](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m07s)

[number of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m10s)

[things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m12s)

[beyond that so you can compile for like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m13s)

[web and whatnot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m15s)

[whereas maui's um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m17s)

[target outputs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m19s)

[are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m21s)

[they don't necessarily compile for web](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m24s)

[they go the other direction so right now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m26s)

[blazers the the new hot idea](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m28s)

[um and they do have blazer controls](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m31s)

[where you can write your your ui as](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m33s)

[blazer and then pull that into](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m35s)

[to all of the other platforms](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m38s)

[um can we ever see you do a code review](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m40s)

[on the stream you maybe don't know](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m42s)

[[Applause]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m48s)

[we could probably do that i've done a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m51s)

[couple code review ones](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m53s)

[of like pull requests for the material](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m55s)

[design library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m57s)

[and a few others](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h20m59s)

[it would be interesting to pull some of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m01s)

[those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m04s)

[it's unfortunate because some of my more](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m08s)

[interesting code reviews i do for my job](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m09s)

[and unfortunately those are](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m11s)

[generally not on repositories that i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m14s)

[allowed to share](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m16s)

[so most of the projects i'm working on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m18s)

[at the moment are not open source which](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m20s)

[is a little bit of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m23s)

[an interesting thing um doing an](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m24s)

[interview though](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m27s)

[we could probably arrange that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m30s)

[i had actually talked to a colleague](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m33s)

[about doing that only having me be on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m35s)

[the receiving end of it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h21m39s)

[great as long as you stay on the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m21s)

[get into some creative edge cases things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m25s)

[get really hard really fast](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m27s)

[um specifically when you have to when](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m30s)

[but when i looked at it before they they](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m57s)

[went back quite a ways i don't know how](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h22m58s)

[it would compare to maui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h23m00s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h23m05s)

[win ui 3 stops after the words win ui](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h23m52s)

[win ui 3 is a brand new thing even](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h23m56s)

[though they wrapped one number it is it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h23m58s)

[is very different than when ui do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h24m00s)

[of the library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h24m50s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h24m57s)

[but that's a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h24m58s)

[at least in terms of the material design](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h24m59s)

[and xaml toolkit that is a control that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m01s)

[gets used everywhere](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m03s)

[um but i got the ripple control working](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m05s)

[it is very possible because i know so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m27s)

[potentially working on a win ui uh 3](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m30s)

[on my road map and radar to at least](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m37s)

[investigate how how painful it's going](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h25m39s)

[i want to see what is not tess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h31m51s)

[that's still a test](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h31m56s)

[that's still a test](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h31m58s)

[so this entire method is only used by oh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m01s)

[i guess it's in tess](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m03s)

[okay so let's not do that one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m10s)

[and this one isn't used anywhere](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m15s)

[i think that one was a shim](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m18s)

[if i remember correctly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m21s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m31s)

[well i don't think you can get much](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m46s)

[cleaner of a name than that that's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m48s)

[that's pretty obvious what that class](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m49s)

[does okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m51s)

[got it so there's a there's an extension](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m54s)

[method on that guy that lets me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m55s)

[that lets me shell into it okay okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h32m57s)

[boom boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m01s)

[problem solved](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m04s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m08s)

[that works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m12s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m13s)

[okay so this one here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m16s)

[there were two things we had option and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m18s)

[options i needed to figure out what was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m21s)

[going on there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m22s)

[but in both cases this help builder's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m24s)

[right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m27s)

[wasn't doing much i just want to confirm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m29s)

[that i didn't change this 582 to 584](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m31s)

[so let's go here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m34s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m38s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m40s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m41s)

[program](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m43s)

[02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:51,040](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m45s)

uh

[oh i need 582 on this side](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h33m55s)

[will there ever be a wpf dispatcher](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m00s)

[stream](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m03s)

[ooh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m05s)

[i guess there could be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m07s)

[curious what you'd be interested in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m10s)

[learning on that one justin bieber i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m12s)

[like i've touched on dispatcher](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m14s)

[at various points](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m17s)

[i just don't know if there's enough to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m21s)

[do a whole stream on it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m22s)

[i mean i could i could dive very deep](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m26s)

[into like the synchronization context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m28s)

[and start going through threading in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m30s)

[that way and that will](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m31s)

[that will be a fun rabbit hole](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m33s)

[um okay so this was just help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m36s)

[right so this was legitimately just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m38s)

[shelling out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m40s)

[to the custom help builder right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m42s)

[which had an overload on option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m45s)

[that was going to match on all of them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m49s)

[so this wasn't doing anything](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m55s)

[special at all it wasn't so there's not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h34m58s)

[some fancy overload or any of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m01s)

[jazz so none of this actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m03s)

[really matters so what we kind of want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m06s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m09s)

[let's see a kind of educational stream](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m14s)

[themes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m19s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h35m21s)

[stream ideas people have suggested and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m21s)

[then on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m23s)

[stream one day i usually just uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m27s)

[dive in and take a look at it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m31s)

[i think we're going to call this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m33s)

[something like write option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m34s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m37s)

[this just becomes console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m38s)

[right line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m41s)

[and then this is probably right option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m44s)

[and then i think i just need to go and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m47s)

[again okay does it look like the help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h36m59s)

[public static](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m32s)

[uh i really want to do this method](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m34s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m39s)

[void right option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m41s)

[and i want to get rid of this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m44s)

[and then i want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m47s)

[this to be whatever that out argument](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m48s)

[type is the standard stream something or](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m51s)

[another](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m53s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h39m56s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m00s)

[just call this thing writer option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m04s)

[option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m06s)

[and then this will be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m08s)

[brighter](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m10s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m13s)

[what is your problem now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m14s)

[cannot okay fine](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m16s)

[yeah i've seen the ex one too](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m22s)

[oftentimes i find that people run a muck](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m26s)

[of um some people will put coding](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m29s)

[guidelines about avoiding um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m31s)

[things that aren't well well known](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m35s)

[acronyms the problem is then you get to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m36s)

[debate what the definition of well-known](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m39s)

[acronym is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m41s)

[okay so there's that that works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m42s)

[now the question is this s config option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m45s)

[versus options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m47s)

[yeah and i think to some degree those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m53s)

[naming rules](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m55s)

[do come down a little bit to what your](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h40m57s)

[what you're building okay so there was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m00s)

[an s config option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m02s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m08s)

[s config option uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m09s)

[this was the help options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m12s)

[and this was writing out all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m15s)

[got it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m21s)

[got it okay so that's what all of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m25s)

[were so that needs to actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m27s)

[boy i'm trying to decide](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m33s)

[if that should be there that's a very](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m36s)

[much a hard-coded](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m38s)

[list go up and look at that list real](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m42s)

[quick because that feels like something](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m45s)

[we could just leverage the existing one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m46s)

[for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h41m48s)

[so this is specifically showing help and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m07s)

[usage for config](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m09s)

[but this is almost like it's trying](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m12s)

[i should probably keep it similar](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m16s)

[i think you're well known](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m22s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m26s)

[i don't know if i'm that well known](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m27s)

[but i appreciate the compliment](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m32s)

[assuming that was directed to me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m35s)

[um okay because the problem is the help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m37s)

[item got](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m39s)

[eliminated](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m40s)

[that was calling into here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m43s)

[which was doing a right line of options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m47s)

[and a render as columns](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m54s)

[so i i believe this guy still has a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h42m58s)

[two column help row](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m09s)

[boy this feels like okay so where is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m15s)

[i've now eliminated almost all of the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m18s)

[help building stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m20s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m26s)

[because this is going to end up doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m36s)

[the same thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m37s)

[i almost want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m43s)

[i almost want to just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m52s)

[print config help where do you get set](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m57s)

[to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h43m59s)

[config switches](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m01s)

[are you pulling config switches from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m03s)

[what is this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m06s)

[what are the where do you come from](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m08s)

[this is literally just pulling off of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m12s)

[the config option the config option gets](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m13s)

[built up from that add config option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m16s)

[interesting so this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m24s)

[the dash c](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m27s)

[for each of the config switch](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m34s)

[oh so it's checking the values passed](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m41s)

[into the oh i see what it's doing oh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m44s)

[interesting interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m47s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m49s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m50s)

[this is taking the argument past to the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m51s)

[dash c option](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m54s)

[and it's allowing you to pass in a whole](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m56s)

[lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h44m59s)

[that's why the generic help builder is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m02s)

[not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m04s)

[useful here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m06s)

[but i do think in this case](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m11s)

[maybe this right option should live](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m16s)

[back on this builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m29s)

[let's get rid of you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m30s)

[let's move you back down](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m36s)

[so let's go into here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m44s)

[okay so let's actually steal that back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m46s)

[you come here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m49s)

[come here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m52s)

[i'll put you back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m54s)

[we're gonna get rid of you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h45m57s)

[the problem being that you won't have a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m00s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m04s)

[i do still need to take in the standard](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m05s)

[stream writer because without it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m07s)

[that invoking helps the normal way i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m10s)

[have no way of knowing where this needs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m12s)

[to go to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m14s)

[so we are going to need you to take that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m17s)

[in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m19s)

[i guess the other thing we could do is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m20s)

[we could just have this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m22s)

[because we changed it to no longer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m24s)

[taking the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m26s)

[it used to take in the console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m28s)

[maybe we just put that back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m32s)

[because we're going to end up using this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m35s)

[we've eliminated the places where it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m36s)

[doesn't need it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m38s)

[it's just that now we have because the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m39s)

[base one doesn't contain it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m42s)

[we have to hold on to it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m46s)

[and then that means this can](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m48s)

[it doesn't need to think about it this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m50s)

[guy can handle it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m55s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m56s)

[out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h46m57s)

[that ain't bad that that that ain't bad](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m02s)

[at all okay and then this we can redo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m04s)

[i guess what we could do is we could](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m10s)

[actually downgrade this back to right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m11s)

[actually here let's do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m14s)

[make it match we'll try to make it match](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m17s)

[what it originally was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m19s)

[so this will then become](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m21s)

[console out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m23s)

[um oh i guess that's what this was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m26s)

[intended to be too wasn't it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m29s)

[oh i kind of get it now kind of get it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m31s)

[now these were just helper methods](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m34s)

[around that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m36s)

[so that you could do this kind of thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m47s)

[and i guess we could we could add in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m51s)

[there's a couple of these i'm going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m54s)

[make them private for now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m55s)

[i kind of don't want this arbitrarily](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h47m58s)

[used](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m01s)

[but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m03s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m08s)

[that makes that that makes that a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m10s)

[easier okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m12s)

[we need to implement this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m14s)

[we can now do this and then this is not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m17s)

[render as columns this is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m20s)

[a two column](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m22s)

[layout or something like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m24s)

[what was it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m27s)

[called uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m28s)

[right columns](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m31s)

[it's interesting that this wants a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m38s)

[help context what is it please tell me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m41s)

[it's not just using the context for the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m43s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m45s)

[because that would be annoying](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m47s)

[where's the context used](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m54s)

[it's just legitimately using it for the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h48m58s)

[output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m02s)

[dang it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m04s)

[dang it dang it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m05s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m07s)

[so one i'll leave myself a note](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m13s)

[that this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m14s)

[needs a pr](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m15s)

[because where's that right two column](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m22s)

[this really should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m24s)

[text writer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m27s)

[is all this needs to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m30s)

[and then this can be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m34s)

[output](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m37s)

[and then this comes let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m40s)

[there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m44s)

[this is obviously going to break](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m47s)

[everything but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m48s)

[this is what this should be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m51s)

[no reason to make it more complicated](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m54s)

[than it needs to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m56s)

[that way it's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h49m59s)

[more easily consumable by others okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m01s)

[that doesn't fix my current problem so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m05s)

[we're going to ignore it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m07s)

[but i do want this to be a two column](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m10s)

[help row](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m12s)

[two column help row and this is a if i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m14s)

[remember right a fairly simplistic poco](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m17s)

[so for people who don't know the the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m20s)

[name poco](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m22s)

[p-o-c-o a plain old c-sharp object](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m23s)

[okay so two column help row first column](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m28s)

[it's pretty simple object okay so what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m32s)

[that means over here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m36s)

[what we want to do is we want to replace](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m39s)

[help item](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m43s)

[with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m46s)

[two column help row replace all](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m47s)

[and that should uncomment now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m53s)

[and not suck](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m56s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m59s)

[so that is all of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h50m59s)

[goes like that that goes like that that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m04s)

[goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m06s)

[uh let's see we're gonna go with context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m07s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m11s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m18s)

[that goes like that that goes like that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m29s)

[this just becomes context dot](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m32s)

[great great](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m43s)

[that works that works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m45s)

[probably don't care about that override](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m50s)

[i guess i already had that one didn't i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m53s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m55s)

[we need that okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h51m57s)

[this then becomes items](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m01s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m09s)

[null uh let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m12s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m15s)

[out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m17s)

[create text writer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m18s)

[and then we don't need that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m23s)

[uh let's see this becomes help items](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m27s)

[that drops that drops okay and i want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m31s)

[make sure that that help context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m34s)

[isn't going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m37s)

[great it's on see it requires a command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m39s)

[but the the method only is going to be](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m43s)

[using the text writer](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m45s)

[it's a grumble grumble grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m47s)

[grumbo rumble i very well am responsible](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m48s)

[for this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m56s)

[what's the easiest way around this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h52m58s)

[you know what](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m02s)

[uh let's see var unused gets new](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m07s)

[command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m12s)

[actually we could probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m20s)

[let's just discard that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m23s)

[nope nope](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m28s)

[why are you oh because i'm missing a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m31s)

[semicolon there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m33s)

[okay that probably works now](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m36s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m43s)

[well compiles](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m45s)

[and then hang on why are we using](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m54s)

[the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m57s)

[console right line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h53m58s)

[don't we have the context at this point](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m02s)

[okay we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m08s)

[just gonna replace all of these guys](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m12s)

[real quick](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m14s)

[so it's not gonna make a big difference](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m16s)

[here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m19s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m23s)

[right line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m24s)

[oh interesting there's not a right line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m26s)

[overload with an empty](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m28s)

[um it won't make a big difference here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m32s)

[but the advantage of using the console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m34s)

[from system command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m36s)

[means that you are able to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m43s)

[theoretically mock it or put in a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m44s)

[test implementation inside of the actual](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m47s)

[shipping library of system command line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m49s)

[there is even a test console in the main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m51s)

[project so even though this would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m53s)

[commonly be used for testing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m56s)

[there this is something that's actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h54m58s)

[just in the main](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m00s)

[project](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m01s)

[so there is a test console which another](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m02s)

[name for it could be like an in-memory](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m05s)

[test console that just records things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m08s)

[into um string builders](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m11s)

[so if you want a version of i console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m14s)

[that just writes into a string](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m16s)

[it's in the box](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m19s)

[we use it in system command line for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m20s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m22s)

[um i've seen a handful of people use it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m23s)

[for other things too](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m25s)

[so sometimes test classes are worth it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m27s)

[uh let's see what is you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m31s)

[manually call to string on that guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m38s)

[there that gets rid of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m43s)

[capital console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m46s)

[right line i would like you to be not](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m49s)

[regex and case sensitive](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m51s)

[and with um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m56s)

[white space before you okay got em got](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h55m59s)

[em](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m02s)

[got em got em got em](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m03s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m05s)

[take a look at this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m08s)

[this file we don't need anymore so it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m10s)

[goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m12s)

[we don't actually need the launch](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m14s)

[settings that's just for testing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m16s)

[we changed up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m19s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m22s)

[so key changes we added or we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m26s)

[uh created a new i console property](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m30s)

[since the base class no longer used it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m32s)

[and we changed our signature to taken](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m33s)

[localization resources and forward them](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m36s)

[down to the base we changed this thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m38s)

[from help item since help item was](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m41s)

[deleted to two column help row](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m42s)

[we have](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m46s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m47s)

[ugly thing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m48s)

[that we had to create for](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m50s)

[stupid reasons for the help context](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m52s)

[and then let's see so here is where we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m55s)

[made a ton of changes](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m57s)

[so we cached all of the options we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h56m59s)

[converted these to two column help rows](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m02s)

[we have a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m05s)

[ton of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m07s)

[uh option creations](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m10s)

[assigned into here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m13s)

[necessarily the best person with](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m33s)

[tips for you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m36s)

[oh thank you for the follow i appreciate](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m39s)

[it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m41s)

[um i do i do a little web development](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m44s)

[and whatnot and so i'm](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m49s)

[i'm more than dangerous with it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m51s)

[um like i said happy to answer questions](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m53s)

[if you want to throw something towards](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m55s)

[me](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m56s)

[um i think at this point though because](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h57m58s)

[we did this we can actually probably](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m00s)

[abandon these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m03s)

[so let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m05s)

[discard that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m06s)

[discard discard](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m08s)

[okay the return type from int goes away](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m12s)

[is get value for options we can actually](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m16s)

[kill the type parameter on most of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m19s)

[this just became a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m23s)

[console right line rather than doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m25s)

[anything fancy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m27s)

[no need for a help builder if we don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m29s)

[need it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m31s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m33s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m35s)

[uh there's no reason this shouldn't just](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m37s)

[be called](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m39s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m41s)

[edit file](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m42s)

[not what i wanted](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m45s)

[ah grumble grumble get cracking gum](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m48s)

[grumble grumble when i hit edit i want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m50s)

[you to maintain my cursor position](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m52s)

[577.](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m55s)

[g577 boom](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h58m59s)

[so this was previously called](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m01s)

[help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m04s)

[but we want to go](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m10s)

[five](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m15s)

[seven seven okay so this was previously](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m17s)

[called help builder we'll keep it called](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m20s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m23s)

[this one probably makes sense to go back](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m26s)

[to a help builder write line](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m28s)

[discard](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m30s)

[okay so this changed into just passing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m32s)

[the localization resources and setting](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m34s)

[the exit code](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m36s)

[same thing here added in localization](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m40s)

[resources as a constructor argument](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m42s)

[called right](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m46s)

[using the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m47s)

[console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m49s)

[and then exit code there](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m53s)

[and then switched all these console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m57s)

[right lines down to using the i console](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=02h59m58s)

[oh we need to delete all this see i told](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m04s)

[you i was going to leave it in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m06s)

[uh all of this stuff is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m13s)

[has nothing to do with this library](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m15s)

[get rid of all that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m18s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m23s)

[745 okay so that's fine and then we get](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h00m25s)

[okay so let's go up and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h01m23s)

[let's rename some of these things so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h01m30s)

[actually let's just start at the top](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h01m34s)

[so what is it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h05m59s)

[what is it complaining about here so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m01s)

[uh parser](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m09s)

[did it end up doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m24s)

[oh is this under the hood using the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m28s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m30s)

[[ __ ] it is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m32s)

[uh i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m47s)

[bet you under the hood that is a](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m49s)

[i betcha this is doing a very simplistic](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m54s)

[yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i bet you you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h06m58s)

[are i bet you](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m01s)

[i have a strong suspicion i know exactly](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m03s)

[what you're doing](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m06s)

[command line builder use defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m11s)

[well doesn't that just bite](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m14s)

[because this guy here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m23s)

[is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m25s)

[surely the problem child](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m26s)

[because of that use defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m38s)

[here i can just show what i what i](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m39s)

[intrinsically know under the hood so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m41s)

[this uses command line builder use](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m43s)

[defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m45s)

[and so it is adding in all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m46s)

[and i don't think we want all of these](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m52s)

[specifically we don't want help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m55s)

[we don't want version](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h07m58s)

[okay so i think the i think the work](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m01s)

[around for this is to just not use](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m03s)

[yeah we're going to go back to the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m08s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m16s)

[we're going to do this maneuver](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m17s)

[so let's go back to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m19s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m21s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m23s)

[rather than just straight up invoke](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m25s)

[we're gonna do this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m29s)

[and then we are going to do s underscore](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m32s)

[root command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m35s)

[our parser](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m40s)

[and then i don't actually want all of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m42s)

[those thingies i want parser and i don't](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m44s)

[think i want to do use defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m48s)

[i think we want to actually strip out](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m51s)

[some of the defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m53s)

[so specifically we don't want version we](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m55s)

[don't want help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m56s)

[but i don't see why we wouldn't want](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h08m58s)

[the rest of that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m02s)

[we're gonna not use defaults](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m05s)

[but we are going to turn on the rest of](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m08s)

[the stuffs](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m10s)

[so this is part of how system command](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m11s)

[line ends up giving you a lot of those](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m13s)

[magical things](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m15s)

[when you go through the default invoke](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m16s)

[async it was doing this this builder it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m18s)

[was adding all of this stuff into it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m21s)

[like the register with dot net suggests](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m23s)

[for the tab completion the typo](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m25s)

[correction the parser reporting the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m27s)

[exception handler handling cancel on](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m28s)

[like the the control c](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m31s)

[directives all that jazz](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m36s)

[okay let's try this again](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m38s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m47s)

[progress](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m49s)

[an alias cannot be null empty](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m51s)

[or consist entirely of white space](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h09m54s)

[uh let's see custom help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m00s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m05s)

[this constructor](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m09s)

[i really don't like that instance](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m22s)

[look at that that looks](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m26s)

[that looks remarkably better i'm gonna](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m29s)

[back this out a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m31s)

[just so i can see it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m34s)

[uh but that looks like what i would](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m38s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m41s)

[we can check it against the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m43s)

[no not that one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m50s)

[this](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m51s)

[so](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m57s)

[do to do](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h10m58s)

[oh i think we actually do want to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m04s)

[include help because it looks like](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m06s)

[use help](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m11s)

[it looks like that is actually adding in](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m12s)

[so there's a small but important](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m16s)

[difference between that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m18s)

[and](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m21s)

[that](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m25s)

[i think that is](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m37s)

[expected just looking at the usage here](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m40s)

[as you can see the default help builder](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m49s)

[dropped the](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m51s)

[the options](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m54s)

[yeah that's a little yucky it's a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m55s)

[yucky](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m57s)

[but](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h11m59s)

[it works](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m02s)

[okay well let's](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m05s)

[let's clean these up](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m07s)

[uh simplify name](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m09s)

[yeah apply](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m15s)

[okay let's just quick review this one](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m18s)

[more time and then i think i'm going to](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m20s)

[pr it](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m23s)

[and forth on this i will be a little](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m28s)

[shocked if it gets merged wholesale](https://youtu.be/owL4oR2rXlw?t=03h12m30s)
