[made a small boo-boo and I updated all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m09s)

[the softwares like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m12s)

[20 minutes ago that was a bad idea you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m15s)

[should not update all of your software](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m17s)

[right before getting ready to stream](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m19s)

[wanted to talk about and play with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m22s)

[tonight so yeah it's kind of a necessity](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m24s)

[kind of dumb I probably updated a lot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m27s)

[more stuff than I probably should have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h01m29s)

[announced but if you click on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h02m43s)

[the.net one one worth subscribing if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h02m46s)

[haven't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h02m49s)

[um they do have a bunch of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m07s)

[individual sessions set up here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m08s)

[um where you can uh dive into just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m11s)

[getting those ones there as well so uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m14s)

[worth checking out this.net conf 2022](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m18s)

[playlist if you want to see some of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m21s)

[cool stuff there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m23s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m25s)

[two announcements that got me really](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m26s)

[excited that I think are totally awesome](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m28s)

[uh we're gonna start with Dev tunnels so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m31s)

[drop a link to this if people are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m35s)

[interested so for anybody who's worked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m37s)

[with tools like maybe ngrok](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m39s)

[um this is built-in support for this so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m42s)

[this is affectionately usually referred](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m46s)

[to as a reverse proxy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m48s)

[but the idea is sometimes you want to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m50s)

[run like a web service an asp.net core](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m53s)

[app locally on your system but you need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m55s)

[something else uh to be able to hit that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h03m59s)

[local system via a publicly accessible](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m02s)

[URL hence the reverse proxy idea right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m05s)

[there's a proxy in the internet that has](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m08s)

[some sort of dnsable name that something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m10s)

[else can hit but you want that to get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m12s)

[routed down onto your local running](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m14s)

[instance because you're debugging](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m16s)

[building whatever oftentimes this gets](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m18s)

[used when you're building out like web](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m21s)

[hooks so for example you're building an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m22s)

[endpoint that's designed to be invoked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m25s)

[by a web hook and you want to validate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m27s)

[that integration works but you don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m29s)

[want to publish it right you want to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m31s)

[debug locally to like you know see the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m32s)

[payload coming in or whatever right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m34s)

[Dev tunnels is exactly that and the demo](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m37s)

[that they did it was actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m39s)

[um developer a was working on an app](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m42s)

[fired up the dev tunnels locally sent](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m45s)

[the link via teams or insert favorite](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m47s)

[chat application here over to another](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m50s)

[developer on our team that other](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m53s)

[developer was able to load up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m55s)

[um the running app that was local on uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h04m58s)

[her teammate system and then I think](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m01s)

[they had Swagger open and they just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m03s)

[invoke some endpoints there so it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m05s)

[actually a pretty cool thing to be able](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m07s)

[to go through and set up and the fact](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m09s)

[that this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m11s)

[not that complicated to get up and going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m13s)

[right so you end up running the the app](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m16s)

[locally but then going through what is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m19s)

[it the vs tunnel](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m22s)

[something another randomly generated](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m24s)

[thing underneath visual studio.com](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m27s)

[you're it automatically routes it in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m29s)

[which is just absolutely awesome right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m31s)

[like this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m35s)

[this is an awesome feature so worth](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m38s)

[noting uh all the stuff I'm going to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m40s)

[showing off tonight if you weren't at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m42s)

[least on visual studio uh 2022 17 4 you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m44s)

[probably aren't going to get access this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m49s)

[uh request access to the feature too](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m51s)

[like even though this is on the docs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m53s)

[page as the form indicates uh the this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m55s)

[is no longer a sign up thing it's just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h05m58s)

[it's out so at some point this bullet](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m00s)

[point will probably disappear off the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m03s)

[the list and I can't recall if we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m05s)

[actually need to have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m08s)

[if this is a preview feature we can go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m10s)

[look real quick let's look uh tools](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m12s)

[options so also worth noting a lot of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m16s)

[this stuff I'm going to show tonight is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m18s)

[uh new to me too so there's going to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m21s)

[a little bit of experimentation in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m23s)

[learning](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m25s)

[yeah so enable Dev tunnels for web](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m26s)

[applications I have already got it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m28s)

[enabled it is still under preview](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m30s)

[features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m32s)

[on visual studio so that that step is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m33s)

[still required but yeah so this one this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m36s)

[one got me quite excited because I've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m40s)

[done a lot of work building out asp.net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m42s)

[core applications that had to do web](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m44s)

[hooky related stuff and being able to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m46s)

[have a built-in reverse proxy without](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m49s)

[needing to rely on third-party tools](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m52s)

[like ingrock was pretty slick uh okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m53s)

[next one that I thought was really cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m57s)

[so if you've ever tried to build out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h06m59s)

[any sort of off inside of asp.net core](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m03s)

[it can be a bit of a pain uh for testing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m06s)

[out uh jot tokens or Json web tokens but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m10s)

[most people call them jwts or jots](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m14s)

[um there is a net Global tool that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m17s)

[can uh grab that lets you uh build up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m20s)

[and create your own uh Dev jot tokens so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m24s)

[that you can actually Test passing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m29s)

[different things in so okay I want a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m31s)

[user that has let's see I think they've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m33s)

[got a sample down here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m35s)

[schemas Bearer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m38s)

[uh show all yeah but you can you can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m41s)

[build up a jot token and specify what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m44s)

[Scopes you want it to have so rather](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m47s)

[than having to go through and and muck](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m49s)

[with whatever system is actually doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m52s)

[your your identity bits you can use this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m53s)

[to be able to effectively test your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h07m57s)

[identity work so you'll note in this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m01s)

[example here a lot of the.net comp was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m03s)

[showing off](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m05s)

[um minimal apis which are cool they got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m06s)

[some improvements that's great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m09s)

[yeah so just be aware when you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m11s)

[looking at this this is the minimal API](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m13s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m16s)

[but if you go through and set this up uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m18s)

[this allows you to specify different](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m21s)

[Scopes or claims coming through on your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m24s)

[token so that you can uh validate them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m26s)

[here which again one of those things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m29s)

[that used to be kind of a pain in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m31s)

[neck to test that is now just a lot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m33s)

[easier like this is one of the awesome](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m36s)

[things about being a net developer my](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m38s)

[heavily biased opinion is our tooling is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m42s)

[awesome like dot net tooling and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m45s)

[ecosystem is just straight awesome some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m48s)

[of the stuff that we can do with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m51s)

[debugging is absolutely amazing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m52s)

[right like I can attach to a running](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m55s)

[thing out Azure set a breakpoint without](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h08m58s)

[bringing down production and step](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m01s)

[through things like it is absolutely](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m02s)

[amazing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m04s)

[sorry my visual studio installed just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m06s)

[finished updating all the things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m08s)

[okay so now so those were just a couple](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m10s)

[things from netcomp that I got really](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m13s)

[excited about when I saw I was like this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m15s)

[is pretty slick they there is a lot of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m17s)

[good information](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m20s)

[um in those sessions for net conf and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m22s)

[I'll be honest I haven't gotten through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m25s)

[all of the day two stuff which was today](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m26s)

[so that I I briefly got through some of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m29s)

[the C sharp bits uh a lot of it I was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m33s)

[somewhat familiar with already because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m36s)

[I've been watching the previews and C](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m37s)

[sharp for those people who may be new to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m39s)

[it is open source now so it's kind of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m41s)

[hard for them to surprise the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m44s)

[community with new features in c-sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m46s)

[because most of the time like the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m48s)

[language design meetings are held on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m49s)

[YouTube where anyone can watch like it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m52s)

[kind of hard to surprise people the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m55s)

[repos are open source like yeah you can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h09m57s)

[still sneak some stuff in if people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m00s)

[aren't paying attention but there's kind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m01s)

[of a lot of people watching so it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m03s)

[yeah I I think they've given up on doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m05s)

[the like the surprise reveal it's like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m07s)

[yeah this is what's coming the the only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m09s)

[surprise is which features make it into](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m11s)

[the final release which is which ones](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m13s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m14s)

[because uh I think I heard somebody on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m15s)

[the c-sharp team once comment that the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m17s)

[the team has deep-seated commitment](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m19s)

[issues uh and so they will never](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m21s)

[guarantee that a feature is going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m24s)

[make it into a release until it actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m25s)

[ships so once it ships then you can rely](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m27s)

[on it but up until it ships yeah there's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m30s)

[there's no promises](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m32s)

[um Okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m34s)

[I did want to call out so there are a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m36s)

[couple Pages I'm going to drop links to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m37s)

[here of what's new in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m39s)

[let me just fix the links up so that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m42s)

[because mine are set to English](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m47s)

[so real quick a brief discussion on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m49s)

[subtle but important difference between](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m54s)

[net 7 and c-sharp 11.](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h10m56s)

[so this is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m00s)

[oftentimes I see people get all confused](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m02s)

[about so this stuff just released](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m04s)

[yesterday and me being the crazy person](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m06s)

[I am it's like I like living on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m09s)

[bleeding edge let's update all the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m11s)

[things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m13s)

[right I will probably start updating a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m14s)

[lot of my open source projects to to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m17s)

[latest and greatest stuff but the one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m19s)

[thing that's important to remember is in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m22s)

[order to leverage any of these features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m24s)

[the people working on it have to have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m26s)

[the latest tool chain so that typically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m29s)

[boils down to installing the latest.net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m32s)

[SDK](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m34s)

[um and or latest Visual Studio update](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m37s)

[right so if you're doing like vs code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m41s)

[development you need to download the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m42s)

[latest SDK to make sure you're good](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m44s)

[there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m46s)

[um if you're in Visual Studio generally](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m47s)

[if you're just doing latest and greatest](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m49s)

[updating Visual Studio will get you the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m51s)

[latest SDK to start playing with and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m53s)

[what that ends up meaning is when a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m55s)

[compile happens when you run.net build](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h11m58s)

[or F5 in Visual Studio Ms build kicks](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m00s)

[off looks at your project file builds up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m04s)

[a set of files and those files get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m07s)

[passed to a program called](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m09s)

[csc.e.exe which is the c-sharp compiler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m12s)

[or code name Rosalind which I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m16s)

[pretty sure the repo name on GitHub is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m19s)

[still Roslyn](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m21s)

[regardless files get built past the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m22s)

[compiler compiler reads in the files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m24s)

[does the needful generates your assembly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m27s)

[out we go right everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m29s)

[leverage language features you just need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m32s)

[the latest compiler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m36s)

[so I'll say that again to leverage the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m39s)

[latest language features so C sharp 11](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m41s)

[you need the latest compiler now where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m44s)

[that gets a little bit murky is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m46s)

[sometimes language features also require](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m49s)

[the latest version of.net and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m52s)

[depending on the type of project you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m56s)

[building it's usually fairly easy to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h12m57s)

[update your language version but it may](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m00s)

[be harder to update your framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m03s)

[version](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m04s)

[so for example I do a lot of WPF work if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m06s)

[I go and update my framework on a WPF](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m09s)

[app to net7 what that means is now every](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m12s)

[uh computer I want to deploy my WPF app](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m16s)

[onto needs to have Net 7 available and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m19s)

[I'm kind of phrasing it that way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m23s)

[intentionally because Net 7 available](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m24s)

[like I could bundle it in package say](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m26s)

[Galaxy All That Jazz there's options but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m30s)

[in order for my app to run I'm going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m32s)

[need net 7. right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m35s)

[whereas to use latest language features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m37s)

[I the developer just needs to have the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m40s)

[latest tooling so quite often](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m44s)

[um especially if you're working in a big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m47s)

[company rev uh revving the framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m49s)

[version](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m51s)

[is usually a little bit of a bigger](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m52s)

[conversation right it's how much do you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m54s)

[control the the people installing how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h13m57s)

[your deployments work right if you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m00s)

[pushing out like an asp.net core](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m02s)

[application onto a server somewhere you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m04s)

[need to make sure that whatever's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m07s)

[running it has the appropriate runtime](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m10s)

[installed so if you're inside of like a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m12s)

[Docker container bumping that version up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m14s)

[just to make sure that you are now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m16s)

[inside of a container that has the Net 7](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m18s)

[runtime](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m19s)

[because even though the compiler May](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m21s)

[generate that assembly if you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m23s)

[leveraging newer framework features you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m24s)

[need that with your app in order for it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m27s)

[to work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m29s)

[so revving to Net 7 so revving both is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m30s)

[always good but it's important to note](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m34s)

[that you can rev these things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m36s)

[independently and oftentimes people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m37s)

[forget about that they're like oh C](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m38s)

[sharp 11 came out we can't update right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m40s)

[away you know that's a big conversation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m42s)

[it's like why did all your developers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m43s)

[update their Visual Studio yeah great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m45s)

[let's just update our Lang version to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m48s)

[c-sharp 11. now not all the features are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m51s)

[available because like for example C](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m54s)

[sharp 10 they added default interface](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m56s)

[implementations that required both](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h14m58s)

[language changes and run time changes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m01s)

[so to leverage that like you may be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m05s)

[having the latest SDK but for it to work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m07s)

[you still need the uh the latest runtime](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m09s)

[there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m12s)

[okay so we're going to start](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m13s)

[running through some of these because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m15s)

[some of these I kind of want to dive](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m16s)

[into a little more deeply and and play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m18s)

[with a little bit more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m21s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m22s)

[this thing here these are currently](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m24s)

[preview features you must set laying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m26s)

[version to preview as of Tuesday this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m28s)

[a lie](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m31s)

[so as of November 8th this is no longer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m33s)

[true so how you can tell if it's true or](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m37s)

[not is you grab yourself a terminal and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m39s)

[you go dot net dash dash list sdks](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m42s)

[right so you can see oh I've got a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m46s)

[couple old ones I should probably clear](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m48s)

[out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m49s)

[um like I I don't need these ones here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m51s)

[but the important thing is I've got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m54s)

[7.0.100 and if you are interested the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h15m57s)

[way the dot net does the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m00s)

[um the versioning is kind of a little](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m02s)

[bit weird there's actually four parts to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m04s)

[the version part one part two this first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m07s)

[digit here is part three and then this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m10s)

[is part four which is why you see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m13s)

[versioning that ends up looking like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m14s)

[this so the the.net SDK does not follow](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m16s)

[semantic versioning](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m20s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m22s)

[so you just need to be mildly aware of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m23s)

[that and typically that doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m25s)

[usually that isn't a big thing right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m28s)

[because the the.net tooling them revving](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m30s)

[this from 301 to 305 you're not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m34s)

[referencing it as an assembly right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m37s)

[you're referencing the the framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m39s)

[which is different](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m42s)

[so this going from 301 to 305 yeah you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m43s)

[can kind of treat it like semantic](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m46s)

[versioning but you do not need to set](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m48s)

[your Lang version to preview because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m50s)

[this SDK is no longer preview if you've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m52s)

[got a previous uh Net 7 SDK that has The](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m55s)

[Hyphen preview on there you probably](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h16m58s)

[want to get rid of it so I got bit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m00s)

[because I run both visual studio and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m03s)

[visual studio preview and for some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m05s)

[reason after updating vs 2022 preview to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m07s)

[the latest release that dropped](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m11s)

[yesterday I had a stray](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m12s)

[uh 7.0.100 something or another preview](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m15s)

[SDK floating around that was causing me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m18s)

[all kinds of grief so if you update and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m21s)

[you have problems](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m23s)

[just go check your list of sdks](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m25s)

[get rid of anything you don't need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m27s)

[um and in case you're unaware you just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m29s)

[you uninstall the sdks by doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m32s)

[um just add remove programs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m36s)

[hey thanks thanks it is good to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m39s)

[online again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m42s)

[uh one other thing I will comment on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m43s)

[um I am](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m46s)

[I'm starting to put together a plan to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h17m47s)

[bottom you'll figure out my URL scheme](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m03s)

[but I I figured I would start doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m06s)

[those that way it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m08s)

[smaller easier digestible chunks and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m09s)

[more importantly I can answer a single](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m13s)

[question in 10 minutes and then just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m15s)

[hyperlink people to it it's really fun](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m17s)

[when people ask a question and I just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m19s)

[send them YouTube links](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m21s)

[I enjoy it Okay so we've got here we got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m22s)

[here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m25s)

[um one other comment I will make so here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m27s)

[I I just went file new project console](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m29s)

[app](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m31s)

[um I'd love to see something about net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m33s)

[7. well you are in luck tonight that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m34s)

[that's where we're going we are going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m37s)

[play with all the new features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m38s)

[so I just did brand new console](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m40s)

[application uh if you're familiar with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m42s)

[the default project template for net six](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m44s)

[not shocking uh it looks pretty much the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m47s)

[same the six turned into a seven](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m49s)

[who would have thunk](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m51s)

[um and you can see top level statements](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m53s)

[standard default project template](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h18m57s)

[um the one thing that I will also](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m00s)

[mention as well is people uh let's see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m02s)

[there is a Blog that came out recently](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m06s)

[uh let's see Net 7](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m08s)

[standards support I think I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m13s)

[remember they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m21s)

[uh is this was this what they updated so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m24s)

[Microsoft updated their](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m26s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m29s)

[support policy naming and this is by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m30s)

[name only because people got weirded out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m33s)

[by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m35s)

[yeah so this is this is where it is this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m37s)

[this is the guy this is the guy I knew I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m39s)

[saw it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m43s)

[people were getting uh a little freaked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m45s)

[out about how uh.net does their](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m47s)

[versioning so they they renamed it just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m50s)

[so that people were clear that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m53s)

[the the standard term support STS just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h19m56s)

[means that they're going to happen](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m00s)

[um they're only going to support it for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m03s)

[a shorter period of time right versus](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m05s)

[LTS and the way you make the decision](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m08s)

[here is how frequently you are able to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m10s)

[update your application so some programs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m13s)

[specifically in big Enterprises they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m16s)

[don't they may have some apps and don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m18s)

[have a lot of dedicated developers and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m21s)

[revving their framework version](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m23s)

[um every year sounds like pulling teeth](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m25s)

[right if you're in that situation LTS is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m28s)

[the answer for you right you want](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m31s)

[something that you can count on it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m33s)

[going to be nice and stable you're gonna](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m35s)

[get three years worth of support](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m37s)

[everyone's happy right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m39s)

[if you are in a situation where you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m41s)

[on a team that likes to that is that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m44s)

[likes to and is able to update fairly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m46s)

[frequently feel free to grab any of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m48s)

[these standard term supports and I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m51s)

[trying to remember what the old name was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m53s)

[for this this is the one that confused](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m54s)

[everybody there is no reduction in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m56s)

[quality standards right the same quality](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h20m59s)

[standards that Microsoft holds their LTS](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m01s)

[releases to is the same quality](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m03s)

[standards they hold their STS releases](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m06s)

[to it's just that for them there's a big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m08s)

[overhead if you have to maintain every](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m11s)

[single release for three years like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m14s)

[every version they're supporting adds](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m16s)

[overhead](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m18s)

[and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m19s)

[what they've said that they're going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m21s)

[do is every even numbered release so six](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m23s)

[eight Etc is going to be the LTS](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m26s)

[three-year support and every odd](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m30s)

[numbered one so five and now seven is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m32s)

[going to be an STS release so standard](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m35s)

[term support meaning they're only going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m37s)

[to actually have support for it for 18](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m39s)

[months and they because they're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m41s)

[releasing new versions every year if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m43s)

[are able to update your framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m46s)

[version every 12 months and that sounds](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m47s)

[like a good thing to you and not like a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m50s)

[bad thing then feel free to grab an STS](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m52s)

[version right it's all about how how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m54s)

[long Microsoft is going to support them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m58s)

[for there is no difference in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h21m59s)

[quality bar right the same set of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m01s)

[testing that goes into an STS release](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m03s)

[goes into an LTS release](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m05s)

[it's the exact same stuff the only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m08s)

[difference is how long how long they're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m10s)

[going to end up supporting them for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m12s)

[so worth noting as that could make the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m15s)

[decision about whether you jump into Net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m18s)

[7 right away or not okay so let's play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m20s)

[around with some of these things because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m24s)

[I I've read through this list and I've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m25s)

[looked at them a lot but some of these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m27s)

[I'm actually curious as to how they're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m30s)

[implemented so and I'm going to do these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m31s)

[kind of in a random order that I pick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m33s)

[um completely arbitrarily](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m36s)

[um they are Where was the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m39s)

[rostering literals I think this is what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m44s)

[I'm what I'm looking for yeah so there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m46s)

[I think the way I could sum up all of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m51s)

[these features in C sharp 11 smoothing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m52s)

[over rough edges and just adding quality](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m55s)

[of Lifestyle so raw string the literals](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h22m57s)

[so we've got a situation and again I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m00s)

[going to play with this I haven't played](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m03s)

[with it so this is all just figuring it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m05s)

[out right so uh let's go string Foo gets](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m06s)

[bing bing bing huh yeah see that nice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m11s)

[tooling support uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m13s)

[this is line one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m16s)

[uh this is line two thank you copilot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m18s)

[you want to try again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m21s)

[for uh this is indented boom semicolon](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m24s)

[okay and then we're gonna come down here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m31s)

[and we are just gonna write out Foo](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m32s)

[no thinking chip](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m35s)

[easy app](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m38s)

[boom okay not surprising it outputs a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m45s)

[string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m48s)

[the the nice thing here like some other](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m49s)

[language might call these hear strings](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m52s)

[I've seen that uh term thrown around I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m54s)

[familiar with it for like terraform](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h23m57s)

[um or I guess HCL is the magical](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m00s)

[incantation there but the important](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m02s)

[thing to note here is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m04s)

[one the indentation level so if I back](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m07s)

[this guy up to here and rerun it because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m10s)

[you'll know with the with the string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m12s)

[indented](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m14s)

[to here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m15s)

[this was nice justification if I back](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m17s)

[this guy up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m20s)

[you'll note now everything is indented](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m23s)

[so your closing marker](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m25s)

[determines your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m29s)

[left trim](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m31s)

[I think it's probably the the cleanest](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m34s)

[way to say that so you can and I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m35s)

[actually curious kind of what happens if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m38s)

[I do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m39s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m40s)

[cool straight up compiler so if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m43s)

[indent too far because that doesn't make](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m46s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m48s)

[but it now allows because especially if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m49s)

[you're like inside of a method and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m52s)

[there's already some nesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m53s)

[typically what would happen before is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m55s)

[when we would do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m57s)

[um raw string literals is we'd run into](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h24m59s)

[this fun problem where now you have to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m01s)

[do this funky new line bits](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m03s)

[no more funky new line bits you can do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m05s)

[this and now you might ask the question](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m08s)

[well hang on what if I want to have a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m10s)

[string that has quotes in it right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m13s)

[one this is convenient](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m15s)

[right and actually we'll quote this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m17s)

[this is line one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m20s)

[and then you know we'll do the sarcastic](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m22s)

[this is line two but now what happens if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m24s)

[I have three quotes in it right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m26s)

[well the way you escape it is this just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m29s)

[needs to be three or more quotes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m32s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m36s)

[three or more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m37s)

[and now that there's four quotes here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m40s)

[denoting this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m42s)

[three quotes is now perfectly legit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m45s)

[right and you can just keep adding as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m48s)

[much as your heart's content the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m50s)

[rules as I understand it this the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m52s)

[closing one has to be on its own line](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m54s)

[and it will and it's going to control](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h25m56s)

[that left trim bits](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m00s)

[and this one it doesn't matter right we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m02s)

[can move it up we can move it down](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m04s)

[either one is fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m05s)

[we get a nice thing and it escapes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m07s)

[nicely](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m09s)

[this is one of those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m10s)

[I'm gonna make writing big strings](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m13s)

[really nice because occasionally I need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m16s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m18s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m20s)

[now the one thing I did want to take a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m21s)

[look at here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m23s)

[yeah there's the the left trim bits uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m24s)

[two braces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m28s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m29s)

[uh I don't really want to read the full](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m34s)

[thingy here that sounds like a lot of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m37s)

[reading I am interested in how this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m39s)

[works here with the dollar sign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m41s)

[so let's let's let's play with that so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m43s)

[if I do this right and I'm gonna go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m46s)

[int number gets and 42 is obviously the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m50s)

[correct answer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m54s)

[um if you don't get this joke Princess](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m56s)

[Bride movie wonderful uh this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h26m57s)

[indented and we're gonna go here and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m00s)

[we're gonna go with number](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m02s)

[right and so they did double dollar sign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m04s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m07s)

[got it so if you're building up like a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m09s)

[large Json string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m12s)

[right because before in with string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m14s)

[interpolation uh string bar gets right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m17s)

[before we we used to write something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m21s)

[like this uh like if I wanted to do a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m23s)

[Json string I would end up doing well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m25s)

[I'd have to escape my curly braces by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m28s)

[doing two of them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m31s)

[right and then I'd have to go you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m34s)

[he](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m35s)

[and I'd have to escape the quotes and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m38s)

[escape the quotes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m41s)

[oh but this is a literal so that doesn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m43s)

[work I guess I could go well yeah ugh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m45s)

[ugh yeah so this gets ugly because this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m49s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m53s)

[we're gonna throw all that away but now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m55s)

[if I want to be able to do the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m57s)

[equivalent right I could just go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h27m58s)

[there there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m01s)

[key](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m04s)

[and then you know number but because I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m06s)

[want this one to actually be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m11s)

[interpolation I do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m13s)

[and I assume if I do a triple one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m15s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m18s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m20s)

[for anybody who hasn't seen my](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m21s)

[calamities talk this looks like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m22s)

[a beautiful thing to build out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m25s)

[this is this is this is right this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m27s)

[feature is ripe for writing some code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m30s)

[that is completely unreadable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m32s)

[don't do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m34s)

[but I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m36s)

[I'm Chris ludicrous lines of code coming](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m39s)

[from this I am going to totally abuse](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m41s)

[this so short version if you're doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m44s)

[Json or anything else that has curly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m46s)

[braces double things and we probably](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m48s)

[don't need four quotes you probably only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m51s)

[need the three because realistically how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m53s)

[many strings do you how many literal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m56s)

[strings do you have that have triple](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h28m58s)

[quotes in a row](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m00s)

[I'm gonna go with probably not that many](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m04s)

[in fact I don't think I have any in any](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m07s)

[app I've ever written](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m09s)

[yeah I'm gonna go with that so that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m12s)

[cool we like that okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m14s)

[rostering literals cool those are cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m18s)

[those are nice those are happy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m22s)

[uh uh let's see warning wave seven I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m24s)

[don't know what this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m27s)

[uh let's see I any new keywords will be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m30s)

[all lowercase ASCII characters](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m34s)

[oh okay so this is just a new warning](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m37s)

[and in short like some basic coding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m40s)

[guidelines will take you a long way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m43s)

[like there is a great talk uh day one of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m46s)

[dot net comp it was near the end of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m50s)

[day where the Microsoft teams team was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m52s)

[walking through their experience on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m55s)

[their migration from.net framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m58s)

[to.net core31 to.net six](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h29m59s)

[and it was basically just a long list of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m02s)

[Lessons Learned and things that they ran](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m05s)

[into along the way kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m07s)

[um apparently they cut their operating](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m10s)

[costs by a million dollars just by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m11s)

[revving the framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m14s)

[all because of reduced like memory and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m17s)

[CPU consumption and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m19s)

[performance is a feature you should](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m25s)

[update if that matters to you because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m27s)

[the performance metrics of Net 7 over](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m29s)

[net six are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m31s)

[there's some significant bits there but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m32s)

[short version Don't name your classes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m35s)

[all lowercase which is fine right for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m37s)

[anybody looking for a basic coding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m40s)

[guideline in C sharp the standard way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m42s)

[that we name classes is with Pascal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m44s)

[casing So in theory anybody who's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m46s)

[following standard naming conventions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m50s)

[won't run into this ever](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m52s)

[so okay great that's fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m57s)

[take me back oh I control clicked it got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h30m59s)

[it okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m03s)

[improved method group conversion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m04s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m08s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m10s)

[let's see review previous versions of of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m13s)

[the standard prohibited the compiler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m16s)

[from reusing the delicate object created](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m19s)

[from a method group conversion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m21s)

[the C sharp 11 compiler caches the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m23s)

[delegate object created from method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m26s)

[group conversion and reuses that single](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m28s)

[delegate object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m31s)

[oh that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m33s)

[that's kind of cool okay so so what is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m37s)

[that what does that actually mean right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m39s)

[so let's imagine I've got a method uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m41s)

[public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m43s)

[uh void do stuff because that's what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m44s)

[we're going with and I've got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m48s)

[uh uh action of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m50s)

[I don't know string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m54s)

[uh sure action sounds great boom right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h31m57s)

[and we'll just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m00s)

[oh we should put this in a class public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m04s)

[class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m06s)

[things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m07s)

[Jake we're going to just test that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m09s)

[lowercase bit right away](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m11s)

[boom format go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m15s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m18s)

[things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m20s)

[you gonna warn me again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m21s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m26s)

[naming rule violation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m28s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m30s)

[so if you have warnings as theirs in all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m31s)

[lowercase classes that could be a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m33s)

[breaking change to you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m35s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m38s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m39s)

[Mark you is static sure fine uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m42s)

[uh what are you squawking it before](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m49s)

[oh action of string so it wants a string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m53s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m55s)

[42 done](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h32m59s)

[okay so we'll do that we'll do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m01s)

[we'll do that so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m05s)

[how about uh public static void uh print](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m07s)

[string value all right so we'll do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m13s)

[and this will just do a console right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m16s)

[line of value](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m19s)

[so method group conversion is when you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m21s)

[have and I'll just make this static too](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m24s)

[because why not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m26s)

[uh uh sure food you can stay there uh if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m28s)

[we do things do stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m31s)

[right and I pass in things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m35s)

[print](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m38s)

[right this is a method group](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m40s)

[and if I'm understanding this correctly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m44s)

[this guy will now cash the delegate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m47s)

[created from the method group conversion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m50s)

[and reuse that single delegate object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m51s)

[which makes me wonder if I do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m55s)

[what actually is going to happen](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h33m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m02s)

[so I apologize](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m03s)

[we're going to look at some IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m06s)

[because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m08s)

[sometimes reading IL is nice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m10s)

[so let me clear this out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m13s)

[all the stuff no stop it stop it stop](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m17s)

[loading things uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m20s)

[boom it outputted 42 twice great okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m24s)

[open containing folder](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m27s)

[debug](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m30s)

[were people unfamiliar with this program](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m33s)

[it is dnspy it is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m35s)

[unfortunately my decompiler of choice I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m38s)

[say unfortunately because the Project's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m42s)

[been archived on GitHub which makes me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m44s)

[sad](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m46s)

[uh okay so if we look here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m48s)

[what I am looking to see is down here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m52s)

[so this is where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h34m57s)

[um so real quick lesson in can I there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m01s)

[we go sweet okay quick lesson in il for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m04s)

[people who haven't looked at this before](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m07s)

[there's there's a deep talk of doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m09s)

[stuff like this and at one point I did a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m11s)

[talk on IL and I'm pretty sure I bored](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m13s)

[everyone to death because this is a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m15s)

[level of complexity that most people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m17s)

[don't even care to think about](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m19s)

[um but so short version if anybody's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m22s)

[taking an assembly class in like a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m25s)

[university or similar this will feel](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m27s)

[familiar everything uh Works kind of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m29s)

[like a stack and as you execute through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m32s)

[the method there is always the uh op](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m34s)

[code and then the optional value that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m38s)

[gets passed to the op code and some of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m40s)

[these even without much knowledge you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m42s)

[can kind of start to reason through what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m44s)

[these are and oftentimes uh if you click](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m46s)

[on these you can just get the definition](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m50s)

[for them right so LD ftn pushes an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m52s)

[unmanaged pointer type onto the stack](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h35m56s)

[all right so at each step of the way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m00s)

[it's all about looking at and knowing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m02s)

[what's on the stack so when you actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m04s)

[do a method call the parameters that get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m06s)

[passed are going to be the things on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m09s)

[stack right with the first one being the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m11s)

[instance values next one's first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m13s)

[parameter static it's just a first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m15s)

[parameter so what I'm seeing here is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m17s)

[this loads](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m19s)

[the the function pointer onto the stack](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m22s)

[so top item is the function pointer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m24s)

[it calls new creating a new delegate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m26s)

[type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m30s)

[and this guy here is going to ingest the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m31s)

[top two things off the stack right and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m35s)

[so you'll note the thing above it was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m37s)

[load null so we had](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m39s)

[function pointer null as our top two](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m41s)

[items this thing loaded both of those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m44s)

[items off of the stack create a new](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m47s)

[object on the stack that's now the top](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m49s)

[item it's called dupe](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m51s)

[and I don't know why uh or why that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m54s)

[necessary but it does](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m57s)

[uh and then this is the oh this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h36m59s)

[probably why this is the caching so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m03s)

[there's a generated Field behind the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m05s)

[scenes for the for the action delegate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m07s)

[that it created](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m10s)

[and then it called do stuff passing the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m13s)

[value that was top on the stack so this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m16s)

[is why it's duped new object puts the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m19s)

[action delegate on top of the stack dupe](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m21s)

[doubles it so the top two items are now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m23s)

[both referring to this guy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m26s)

[this one pops the Top Value off the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m29s)

[stack assigns it into a field this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m31s)

[does an invocation popping the next](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m34s)

[value off of the stack and passing as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m36s)

[the parameter in to do stuff cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m37s)

[and so then when it comes into here it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m40s)

[reuses that same method delegate from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m43s)

[the same field](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m45s)

[and We're Off to the Races](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m47s)

[that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m49s)

[so short version you get this nice ugly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m51s)

[looking generated class and typically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m54s)

[the compiler does this so there are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m56s)

[naming rules in C sharp about how you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h37m59s)

[can name things but there's different](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m02s)

[naming rules at the IL level and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m04s)

[quite often what the uh or what's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m06s)

[compiler likes to do is anything it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m09s)

[generates it usually generates a name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m11s)

[that's an invalid identifier in C sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m13s)

[um just to avoid naming collisions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m17s)

[because then they don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m19s)

[about it it's really hard to collide if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m20s)

[you pick a name that the people riding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m22s)

[the C sharp couldn't have picked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m25s)

[themselves](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m26s)

[so that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m27s)

[okay so that was a long complicated way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m31s)

[of saying hey look it now cash is this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m33s)

[delegate is that useful I don't know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m35s)

[probably but you get a nice little](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m37s)

[performance bump for not changing a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m39s)

[single line of your code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m43s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m45s)

[cool this invocation uses the cash](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m46s)

[delegate that this one's stored in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m48s)

[field](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m49s)

[that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m51s)

[let's go back and see what else back to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m53s)

[the top](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m56s)

[okay uh generic attributes new lines in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h38m57s)

[string interpolation okay this one has](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m01s)

[annoyed me for a while and so seeing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m03s)

[this fix makes me really really happy so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m05s)

[text inside of the curly braces for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m08s)

[string interpolation can now span](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m10s)

[multiple lines hallelujah hallelujah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m12s)

[okay so previously right if we did](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m16s)

[string bar you know and then we did you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m19s)

[know uh number](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m24s)

[about](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m27s)

[number is we'll make it interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m28s)

[right this is valid right but now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m30s)

[this is valid](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m36s)

[and normally we don't care about this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m38s)

[right normally these new lines didn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m40s)

[matter right up until you decided that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m42s)

[you wanted to do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m44s)

[fancy stuff right like number greater](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m46s)

[than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m50s)

[42 right then put](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m51s)

[you know is a is a big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m55s)

[uh otherwise put small](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h39m58s)

[right like this used to be a major pain](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m01s)

[and it's still kind of a pain because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m04s)

[you have to do this garbage](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m06s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m08s)

[I'll explain the prince in a moment but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m10s)

[we can now at least start making these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m12s)

[things span over multiple lines to kind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m14s)

[of start making the thing line up nicely](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m16s)

[and and do this kind of jazz which is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m18s)

[cool uh the parens inside of the string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m20s)

[interpolation are all because uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m22s)

[typically uh let me do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m26s)

[let me do a second one and I'll do it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m30s)

[here so uh number is right so in C sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m32s)

[we have format specifiers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m38s)

[so for example if we wanted to treat a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m40s)

[number as a currency](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m43s)

[right I believe it's C C1](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m45s)

[so this is the reason why you end up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m47s)

[having to put these parens around](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m49s)

[anytime you do a ternary because colon](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m51s)

[was already used as a delimiter for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m54s)

[format specifiers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m57s)

[so you have to put the parens around it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h40m59s)

[so that the string interpolation knows](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m01s)

[that this is something to be evaluated](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m03s)

[as code and not something that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m05s)

[supposed to be evaluated as a format](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m07s)

[specifier](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m08s)

[so but now it can spam multiple lines so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m11s)

[okay quality of life got better](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m15s)

[everyone's happy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m18s)

[great okay uh list patterns I was going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m20s)

[to come back to generic attributes this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m23s)

[one is just one that has been annoying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m27s)

[for a while is any anytime you had to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m29s)

[pass a a type to an attribute you had to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m32s)

[do type of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m36s)

[and and now you can do generics like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m37s)

[real generics so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m40s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m42s)

[like this will be handy and clean up a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m44s)

[lot of stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m46s)

[um I'm somewhat tempted to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m48s)

[uh for people who watch the stream where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m51s)

[we created a a unit test generator with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m53s)

[a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m57s)

[um with a source generator uh this will](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h41m59s)

[make that a lot cleaner no more type of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m02s)

[um I'll say one less instance where you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m05s)

[need type of type of will never](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m08s)

[completely die there's always going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m10s)

[be places where it's necessary but I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m12s)

[much prefer generics where you can kind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m15s)

[of thread the type right on through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m17s)

[versus](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m19s)

[versus having to use a type of because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m22s)

[the moment you do a type of the code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m24s)

[inside of this attribute now has to act](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m26s)

[on a system.type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m29s)

[whereas the code inside of this can act](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m31s)

[on a t](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m34s)

[which then make uh but which then allows](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m37s)

[more generics inside of the code on your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m40s)

[generic attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m43s)

[and it's all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m48s)

[yeah which I think that just makes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m49s)

[things a little bit nicer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m51s)

[just a little bit nicer for anybody](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m54s)

[interested if I show the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m55s)

[so for example if we look at automocker](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h42m58s)

[so this is this is practical use case](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m02s)

[so this guy here if we look at the tests](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m05s)

[did here no it's here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m10s)

[yeah so before uh we had to specify I uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m15s)

[let me make that a little bigger](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m20s)

[and you a little bit smaller uh so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m22s)

[before when using this test generator](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m25s)

[you would decorate your class with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m28s)

[Constructor tests and you'd have to tell](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m30s)

[if the target type that you wanted to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m32s)

[generate the test for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m34s)

[and so you have to do Target type type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m35s)

[of and yada yada yada and there's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m37s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m40s)

[there's some kind of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m42s)

[cleaner syntax where you can just pass](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m43s)

[it straight on the Constructor which is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m46s)

[great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m47s)

[um but this is one of those cases where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m49s)

[I'm I'm tempted to go in and do a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m50s)

[special](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m54s)

[uh c-sharp 11 version](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m56s)

[that allows you to do this as generics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h43m59s)

[because I'd rather type Constructor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m02s)

[tests you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m03s)

[generic controller and call it a day](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m05s)

[that would make me happy so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m08s)

[that's now on my backlog of project](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m10s)

[things that I want to go do so unless](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m13s)

[somebody beats me to it if somebody](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m15s)

[wants to go Implement that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m17s)

[you do have to use pound ifs because we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m19s)

[have to keep supporting older c-sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m21s)

[laying versions but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m23s)

[it'd be a it'd be a nice thing to add so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m25s)

[again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m27s)

[I I count that as quality of life stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m28s)

[uh ref fields and scoped ref](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m31s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m37s)

[this is one of those use cases that the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m39s)

[number of people who need it if you need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m42s)

[this you already are excited about this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m44s)

[if you're questioning what it is you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m46s)

[don't need it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m47s)

[okay moving on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m49s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m51s)

[oh this one this one is interesting so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m53s)

[native sized integers this this is one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h44m58s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m02s)

[potentially one of those small](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m05s)

[performance bumps that you can start](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m06s)

[using sooner rather than later](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m09s)

[so the idea is that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m15s)

[and this is driven by oh boy so there's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m16s)

[a I was hoping there was a short](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m20s)

[explanation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m21s)

[uh there there is there is a better dock](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m26s)

[that I found on this at some point I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m29s)

[don't know where it is but it's not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m30s)

[linked here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m31s)

[um so native size integers for n n and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m33s)

[nuant these ones will size based upon](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m36s)

[the bitness of the uh running process so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m39s)

[even though I'm on a 64-bit version of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m42s)

[Windows if my process runs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m44s)

[um it underneath 32-bit emulation so the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m47s)

[the x86 emulation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m51s)

[the size of my native int is going to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m53s)

[32 bits](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m56s)

[but there's some nice performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m58s)

[benefits for having things line up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h45m59s)

[nicely on the CPU register size](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m01s)

[so you can use an INT and and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m04s)

[all right so let's go here uh anant](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m08s)

[let's go up here yeah native sized](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m12s)

[integer baby uh so you can use this as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m16s)

[you would mostly like a normal integer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m19s)

[but because you don't necessarily](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m22s)

[unless you make extra checks](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m25s)

[you really can't assume that this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m28s)

[bigger than a 32-bit and even though](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m30s)

[32-bit operating systems it's like well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m32s)

[most things are going to be running](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m34s)

[um 64 bit it's like well but arm is now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m37s)

[making a comeback so it yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m41s)

[um oh nice so now you don't need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m45s)

[directives you can just publish and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m47s)

[build for any architecture it'll](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m49s)

[natively select the correct in type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m50s)

[correct or select the appropriate size](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m52s)

[for an INT the other thing is this thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m55s)

[kind of behaves a lot like you would](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h46m58s)

[expect from the regular int class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m00s)

[um because you've got like Min value max](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m03s)

[value](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m06s)

[right so you can do some stuff to kind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m07s)

[of like find your way into what is the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m11s)

[appropriate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m14s)

[appropriate size but if you start using](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m15s)

[this you do need to keep that idea in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m17s)

[your head that yes this is a nice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m19s)

[convenience but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m22s)

[but you need to be careful that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m25s)

[don't like make a assumptions that it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m27s)

[going to be you know 32 bits wide or 64](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m30s)

[bits wide but again another nice little](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m32s)

[quality of life specifically for things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m36s)

[that were previously going down to in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m39s)

[pointer or similar for a lot of interop](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m41s)

[cases this is probably going to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m43s)

[really nice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m45s)

[um these are slightly different so and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m47s)

[this is something worth calling out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m50s)

[right so int right keyword is shh is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m52s)

[just an alias for int32](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h47m56s)

[um and any int isn't quite the same](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m00s)

[right it's not just a blind Alias](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m02s)

[because it's switching that size at run](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m06s)

[time it's a little different than just a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m09s)

[blind find and replace Alias because if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m11s)

[I type the keyword int you know I and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m13s)

[do in 32j](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m16s)

[if we look at these two variables in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m20s)

[dnspy I get the exact same thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m22s)

[this isn't quite the same](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m25s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m28s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m31s)

[so just be aware of it okay uh what else](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m32s)

[uh pattern matching on span on a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m36s)

[constant string this is one that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m39s)

[again I feel like if you know it know it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m42s)

[you'll be happy about it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m44s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m46s)

[just because so many overloads have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m47s)

[started using spans this becomes a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m49s)

[little bit more prevalent](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m51s)

[so for people unfamiliar span was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m53s)

[introduced in C sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m56s)

[nine I think is when it first dropped](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h48m59s)

[don't quote me going for memory](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m03s)

[um but the idea is if you uh if you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m05s)

[familiar with like database](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m08s)

[constructs where you have tables and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m10s)

[then views into that table if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m12s)

[picture your string as a set of data a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m14s)

[span is just a view into that and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m17s)

[oftentimes so a span of char is just a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m20s)

[view into a string so rather than like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m23s)

[chunking up your string into actual](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m25s)

[substrings which requires string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m27s)

[allocations span lets you keep your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m30s)

[original memory allocation of a string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m32s)

[but maybe look at this view of it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m34s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m37s)

[for example if I go span of char](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m39s)

[uh sub](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m43s)

[string gets and I don't know Kevin and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m45s)

[do one dot dot uh I don't know carrot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m50s)

[two right boom uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m53s)

[uh use as span okay fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h49m58s)

[and uh oh can I just do the straight](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m04s)

[overload into here and get away with it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m07s)

[this way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m09s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m11s)

[uh uh oh this is read only span fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m13s)

[read only span](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m17s)

[happy happy now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m20s)

[I just want to see your overload start](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m23s)

[length right so start at one give me a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m24s)

[length of three right so now I have a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m27s)

[span of characters so it's very similar](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m30s)

[in a lot of cases if you've already](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m33s)

[using like uh substring](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m35s)

[uh the method on string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m38s)

[oftentimes switching to a span will be a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m41s)

[nice uh performance bump because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m43s)

[substring is going to allocate you a new](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m45s)

[string with just you know the characters](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m47s)

[you asked for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m49s)

[whereas this gives you mostly the exact](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m50s)

[same behavior right I'm going to end up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m54s)

[with a substring that starts on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m56s)

[first character and goes three right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h50m59s)

[I'm going to get evi in the middle of it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m02s)

[but I haven't allocated any extra memory](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m04s)

[so this is how a lot of libraries like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m07s)

[the uh Community toolkit mvvm Library](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m10s)

[there is some awesome stuff that they do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m13s)

[in there to have to to either get down](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m15s)

[to zero allocations or real low](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m19s)

[allocation values and in C sharp there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m21s)

[is a huge performance bump from reducing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m25s)

[memory allocations because of uh the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m28s)

[garbage collector if you can cut down](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m31s)

[memory allocations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m33s)

[you will see a performance increase](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m35s)

[so at one point in time there was a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m38s)

[video I was watching](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m40s)

[um and I'm trying to remember who it was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m43s)

[but the presenter at the time uh made](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m45s)

[the statement that you don't ever have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m48s)

[performance problems you have memory](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m49s)

[problems memory problems and memory](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m51s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m52s)

[you solve those and the problem goes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m53s)

[away](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m55s)

[so uh basically we've now added pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m57s)

[matching](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h51m59s)

[against a constant string which I assume](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m01s)

[that means I can now do if substring is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m04s)

[Evin](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m07s)

[huzzah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m13s)

[because that's a pattern match on a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m15s)

[constant string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m17s)

[great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m19s)

[exciting uh extended name up so this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m21s)

[is actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m24s)

[uh really interesting to me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m26s)

[so this is changing up the places where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m29s)

[you can actually use the name of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m33s)

[operator so people unfamiliar with it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m34s)

[right I'm just going to make a mess this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m37s)

[this code is going to be a complete](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m39s)

[nightmare when we're done with it so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m41s)

[right string uh uh name gets name of Foo](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m42s)

[right this is identical uh oh how about](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m48s)

[you can't pick on a variable that has](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m55s)

[been declared yet so we'll pick on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m56s)

[number right so this is this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h52m58s)

[literally the equivalent of having it be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m00s)

[equal to the constant value of Number](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m02s)

[the only advantage of name of is now if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m04s)

[I do some sort of refactoring right and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m06s)

[I I change it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m09s)

[it now updates which is convenient right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m10s)

[we don't like magical strings in our](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m14s)

[code and being able to use the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m16s)

[refactoring is nice but this extends](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m18s)

[where you're able to use name of and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m21s)

[this I wanted to test uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m23s)

[so if you do it on an attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m26s)

[Declaration on the method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m28s)

[you can use the name of operator to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m30s)

[specify the name of a method parameter](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m32s)

[in the attribute or the parameter](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m34s)

[declaration](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m37s)

[for Noble analysis Okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m40s)

[right so if we come in here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m44s)

[can be null](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m48s)

[uh n b null there we go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m51s)

[all right so we do there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h53m59s)

[why is it not finding the so the using](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m03s)

[statement that I want is using](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m05s)

[system dot code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m08s)

[do I not get code analysis is that just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m13s)

[bundled into the box now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m15s)

[me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m19s)

[uh um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m23s)

[oh allow no maybe no okay I'm getting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m29s)

[the names of it wrong](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m32s)

[so how about a loud hole](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m35s)

[find it there we go diagnostics code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m38s)

[analysis that's what I was missing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m40s)

[Diagnostics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m42s)

[okay so uh but this is specifically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m44s)

[for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m48s)

[what does this say uh attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m51s)

[Declaration on the method so rather than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m54s)

[putting the attribute on the parameter I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m57s)

[want to do it on a method with a return](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h54m59s)

[value so uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m02s)

[public uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m05s)

[uh how about string pry parse](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m07s)

[how about](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m12s)

[uh string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m18s)

[value right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m21s)

[and we need to make you static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m25s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m28s)

[oh and actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m30s)

[right part should be a bull](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m33s)

[out int](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m36s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m38s)

[I don't know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m39s)

[number there we go great okay uh so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m41s)

[number gets 42 return true all right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m47s)

[implementation optional](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m52s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h55m56s)

[not know when and this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m00s)

[oh but this isn't quite okay so I need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m06s)

[one of the parameters that actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m08s)

[takes in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m09s)

[uh I need one of the parameters that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m12s)

[actually takes in the parameter name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m15s)

[which one of these things takes in a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m24s)

[parameter name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m27s)

[this loud no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m29s)

[I know I've run into this case I'm just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m34s)

[struggling to find the one where I would](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m36s)

[need the name of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m38s)

[haha this will work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m41s)

[let's grab this because this is what I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m44s)

[want to see the intellisense trigger on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m46s)

[yeah get rid of that boom Okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m48s)

[public static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m52s)

[hush now hush now the return no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m54s)

[boom not null if not no so if the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h56m58s)

[incoming URL is not null this method is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m02s)

[declared to not so if URL is no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m05s)

[return null](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m11s)

[otherwise](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m13s)

[I don't know return](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m15s)

[42. so this is a stupid implementation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m17s)

[uh get value sure](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m20s)

[it's dumb uh but the important thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m25s)

[here is this name of is now able to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m28s)

[Target parameter names](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m30s)

[so it seems like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m35s)

[well there it is in the intellisense](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m38s)

[okay if I come in here and go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m39s)

[string other right what I want to see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m43s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m46s)

[OT](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m48s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m49s)

[so effectively this name if you have an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m52s)

[attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m56s)

[decorating a method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m57s)

[you can now use name of to Target](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h57m59s)

[parameter names](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m01s)

[which is something that was previously](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m03s)

[not possible](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m04s)

[kind of slick it's one of those use](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m11s)

[cases that it's always been annoying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m13s)

[when you get into that situation where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m15s)

[it's like I well because I have no way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m17s)

[to Target name of on a parameter I have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m20s)

[to do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m22s)

[and that always just is yucky](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m24s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m27s)

[yay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m28s)

[that's kind of nice uh let's look at the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m30s)

[UTF string literals](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m32s)

[um I don't know if this actually matters](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m34s)

[okay so UTF string literals so this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m42s)

[this is mildly convenient](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m44s)

[so if you actually need a UTF string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m49s)

[now does this actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m53s)

[oh oh so this is a little different than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m57s)

[a lot of other things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h58m59s)

[I guess it kind of makes sense](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m02s)

[I guess it kind of makes sense so for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m05s)

[example if you wanted a a long right you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m07s)

[would do 42 l](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m12s)

[right so there's a suffix on the end of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m14s)

[the value](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m16s)

[like there I guess there is symmetry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m18s)

[there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m20s)

[but so if I wanted this one to be it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m23s)

[does it handle it if it's an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m27s)

[interpolated string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m29s)

[probably not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m32s)

[this should work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m37s)

[so if I do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m39s)

[ah and this is the other thing is it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m41s)

[doesn't return a string back to you it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m43s)

[returns back a read-only span](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m46s)

[of bytes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m50s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m54s)

[unfortunately makes sense](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=00h59m56s)

[right because strings in.net are utf-16](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m00s)

[but occasionally you do need utf-8 and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m05s)

[so oftentimes what would happen is you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m08s)

[would see people going through the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m10s)

[encoding class when you needed this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m12s)

[previously so you do like system.tax dot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m14s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m18s)

[encoding right and then you do something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m20s)

[like UTF eight](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m23s)

[get bytes right and then you'd feed it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m25s)

[in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m28s)

[you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m29s)

[get bites](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m33s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m35s)

[this looks like to be a shorthand of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m37s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m39s)

[okay great I I mean it's slightly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m42s)

[different right because this is a span](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m44s)

[so the whereas the other one's going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m46s)

[allocate the string and do all of this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m48s)

[just like we were talking about a second](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m50s)

[ago with span](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m52s)

[being a view into that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m54s)

[I imagine that's probably all this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m57s)

[doing is avoiding the allocation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h00m59s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m02s)

[I approve of things avoiding allocations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m03s)

[okay Auto default structs this was one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m07s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m09s)

[again it's one of those if you if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m11s)

[love it you're probably already familiar](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m13s)

[with it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m16s)

[so structs were previously not always](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m17s)

[initializing all of their values structs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m19s)

[in C sharp can often be a pain in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m22s)

[neck because people expect them to work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m25s)

[like reference type classes and they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m27s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m31s)

[and this was one example of how that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m32s)

[would happen](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m34s)

[and yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m38s)

[this is a little this is just a little](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m40s)

[bit nicer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m43s)

[now things behave the way you expect](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m45s)

[huzzah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m46s)

[great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m48s)

[um okay so now we get to the ones that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m50s)

[I'm really really excited to play with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m52s)

[um let's do file scope types first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h01m55s)

[yeah because this is one I'm curious to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m00s)

[play around with to see exactly how it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m02s)

[works okay so there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m04s)

[um quite often](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m07s)

[um I will tell people when I see them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m09s)

[write code to always specify their uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m11s)

[protection modifier on things I always](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m14s)

[hate when I see class space name and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m16s)

[usually tell people I'm like I'm fine if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m19s)

[you leave the the uh the access](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m21s)

[modifiers off but I get to quiz you on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m23s)

[what they actually are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m25s)

[because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m27s)

[they aren't all consistent that's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m29s)

[that's the part that gets hard like the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m31s)

[default value if you write something and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m33s)

[eliminate all of your modifiers is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m35s)

[different depending on whether you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m38s)

[talking about a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m39s)

[um a class a method uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m42s)

[what's the other one that's weird](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m45s)

[class method property field](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m48s)

[those don't all have the same default](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m51s)

[values](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m53s)

[so this is where things get fun](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m54s)

[is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h02m57s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m00s)

[Jordan throws what used to be normal on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m02s)

[its head because for a long time in C](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m05s)

[sharp the the modifiers that you had](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m08s)

[were public let's see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m11s)

[public internal or I'm sorry public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m14s)

[protected internal internal protected](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m17s)

[private and then we added protected](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m19s)

[private](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m22s)

[I feel like I'm missing one more in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m24s)

[there one more combination of them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m26s)

[again complicated uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m28s)

[but this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m33s)

[is file scoped](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m35s)

[so hidden widget](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m44s)

[so and the the place where I see this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m47s)

[being really useful is once again inside](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m49s)

[of source generators](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m51s)

[because if I can declare something and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m53s)

[all I'm trying to do is avoid conflicts](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m57s)

[with something that like because if I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h03m59s)

[write a source generator and I generate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m02s)

[a class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m04s)

[I have to make sure that whatever I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m05s)

[generating doesn't conflict with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m06s)

[something that you know whoever is using](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m09s)

[my source generator has already written](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m11s)

[and that can be kind of a pain and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m14s)

[sometimes you hide it off in a namespace](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m16s)

[or whatever and that's fine kind of a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m18s)

[pain](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m20s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m22s)

[yeah let's let's play with this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m25s)

[so file scoping](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m28s)

[uh I don't care to keep you around so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m32s)

[let's let's do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m35s)

[so one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m37s)

[uh I'm going to change you from public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m39s)

[to file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m42s)

[right and I'm going to add me one more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m43s)

[font](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m45s)

[add class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m50s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m53s)

[right great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m56s)

[still bothers me that you haven't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m58s)

[updated the default template Visual](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h04m59s)

[Studio or whatever right so if I go here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m01s)

[um can I declare](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m06s)

[a public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m08s)

[class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m10s)

[things it was things right yeah public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m12s)

[class things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m16s)

[and that compiles huh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m19s)

[oh that is so slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m24s)

[so I've got a things here and I've got a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m27s)

[things here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m30s)

[okay I gotta look at what it did uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m32s)

[reload all assemblies how did that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m35s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m37s)

[oh that is dirty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m39s)

[so my things class got generated as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m45s)

[program](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m49s)

[insert thingy that looks way bigger than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m50s)

[a good here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m53s)

[double underscore things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m54s)

[and it put it all in here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h05m57s)

[again I'm assuming this is the compiler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m00s)

[just going we're going to make real sure](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m02s)

[we don't conflict with something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m04s)

[interesting that they did that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m08s)

[because here's my other one that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m15s)

[actually in a namespace right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m17s)

[but we've got my things and I've got my](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m19s)

[stuff from my other file sitting over](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m21s)

[here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m23s)

[that's pretty cool okay so now what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m25s)

[happens if I do partials](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m28s)

[right so if I do public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m31s)

[partial class stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m36s)

[right and I do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m39s)

[other stuff right so we're gonna go here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m45s)

[we're gonna get rid of this that will](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m49s)

[definitely conflict](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m51s)

[and if inside of here I go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m53s)

[file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m56s)

[class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h06m58s)

[food stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m00s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m02s)

[uh public void](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m04s)

[boo](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m08s)

[right and I do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m09s)

[public static void uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m14s)

[go get is the night drags on my naming's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m17s)

[gonna get worse](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m21s)

[okay I I do love how it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m26s)

[thank you co-pilot no no not helpful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m31s)

[okay so food stuff go right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m34s)

[so I can write this here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m39s)

[okay fine I'll mark you with static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m42s)

[right now I'm guessing if I take this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m45s)

[and I go over here that same method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m49s)

[doesn't work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m52s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h07m53s)

[that is so weird that I can make](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m01s)

[something that is then restricted to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m03s)

[just that ha](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m06s)

[that is weird because that means I can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m10s)

[take something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m13s)

[right and let's do it as a nested one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m15s)

[right if I go here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m18s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m21s)

[let's see files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m26s)

[file local type must be defined in top](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m28s)

[level okay so you can't Nest them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m30s)

[but I guess it doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m33s)

[it doesn't really matter that you can't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m36s)

[Nest them because you can scope them to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m38s)

[the individual file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m41s)

[yeah it's okay and so food too right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m44s)

[stop complaining](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m49s)

[so because you can scope them to a file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m51s)

[and because you can have any number of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m53s)

[partials that you want](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m55s)

[you really can lock it down to just you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h08m59s)

[can make a type that's only accessible](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m02s)

[to a portion of a class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m04s)

[wow](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m09s)

[that's I mean that's kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m11s)

[that is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m15s)

[I'm gonna have to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m20s)

[I don't know where I'm going to use this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m22s)

[I don't doubt I'm good this this feels](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m23s)

[like one of those things where I've got](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m25s)

[a shiny new hammer and I'm gonna find a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m27s)

[nail to use this with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m29s)

[I don't know where that makes sense like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m31s)

[there's been a handful of times where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m34s)

[I've had to declare something internal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m35s)

[and I'm like I really don't want this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m37s)

[internal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m39s)

[like I really the thing is is that those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m40s)

[use cases that I can think of I've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m43s)

[really wanted it scoped to a namespace](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m45s)

[not to a file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m47s)

[but I wonder if I I wonder if some of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m50s)

[those cases could fall into this work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m52s)

[and make it and have it go through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m54s)

[it's a possibility](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m57s)

[that's a possibility](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h09m59s)

[that still though that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m02s)

[no workie](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m05s)

[that is that is pretty slick though okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m08s)

[so one it works exactly as design it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m11s)

[Scopes the thing just to the file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m18s)

[so the file restricts a top level type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m20s)

[so it's only valid on types so you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m24s)

[aren't going to do this on like methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m27s)

[or something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m29s)

[let me just make sure of that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m31s)

[I'm pretty sure that's if I'm reading](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m33s)

[that right so I can't make you file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m35s)

[is not valid for this item yeah so not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m42s)

[not surprised I was going to say it'd be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m45s)

[really interesting if I could declare a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m47s)

[method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m49s)

[that was only accessible inside of here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m50s)

[because then I would have something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m54s)

[better than private right if rather than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m55s)

[making it private I could just make it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h10m58s)

[file limited and that's now real locked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m00s)

[down it's not only is it only available](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m02s)

[to this class it's only available in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m04s)

[this file in this class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m06s)

[again I kind of see the use case for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m10s)

[this around Source generation and and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m12s)

[wanting to generate things that don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m14s)

[conflict](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m16s)

[so as long as you don't need it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m18s)

[accessible outside you can gen your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m20s)

[types up in your Source generator and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m22s)

[you don't have to worry about that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m25s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m26s)

[it's interesting too that you can do it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m30s)

[on interfaces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m32s)

[yeah I'll have to think](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m37s)

[I'll have to think about I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m40s)

[again this is one of those I feel like I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m43s)

[have use cases for this I just can't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m45s)

[think of them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m46s)

[still](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m49s)

[cool feature cool feature okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m50s)

[generic math support these are some of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m53s)

[the more interesting ones so this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m56s)

[this is something that I I commented](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h11m57s)

[earlier about how some changes require](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m00s)

[the framework and the runtime that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m02s)

[need in order for this to actually work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m05s)

[so this is another one of those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m08s)

[situations where that that comes into](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m11s)

[play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m14s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m16s)

[yeah so the idea here is it is quite](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m18s)

[common and the I think the example they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m22s)

[did](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m24s)

[is probably in here because I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m26s)

[um this morning oh Tanner Tanner uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m28s)

[uh the day two one of the opening talks](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m33s)

[is from Dustin and mads which they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m37s)

[generally do a talk every time there's a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m40s)

[new version of C sharp highly anytime](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m42s)

[you see mads and Dustin doing a talk](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m44s)

[watch it it will be worth your time it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m46s)

[awesome right say that much so once](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m49s)

[again didn't disappoint they go through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m52s)

[a great example like this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m54s)

[I guess their sample is fairly similar](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h12m58s)

[to this right and rather than write it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m00s)

[out it's probably easier to just talk](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m02s)

[through it but the idea being that all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m03s)

[of the built-in types like system in 32](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m07s)

[now have this eye number interface](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m11s)

[and because interfaces can now support](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m14s)

[things like static and Abstract on there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m17s)

[like that's that's the key thing this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m22s)

[generic math is a specific use case of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m24s)

[some underlying features that got added](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m28s)

[right so static and virtual members and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m31s)

[interfaces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m33s)

[so the interface one can be the member](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m35s)

[on the interface can be static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m38s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m41s)

[that's kind of fun and it can be virtual](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m42s)

[which means it can have a default](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m44s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m46s)

[right and then there's some other stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m49s)

[around the checked and shift operators](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m50s)

[and and unsigned right shift operators](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m52s)

[these ones are less exciting this one is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m55s)

[the big the big deal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h13m59s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m02s)

[um yeah explore static abstract](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m03s)

[interface members this guy this is this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m05s)

[is where things start to get real weird](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m09s)

[right and the the advantage here is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m12s)

[operators](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m15s)

[for those people unfamiliar you can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m17s)

[declare your own operators on your own](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m19s)

[types right if you want a plus operator](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m20s)

[on your your cat object you can add it I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m23s)

[don't know what you would add the cat](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m26s)

[with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m27s)

[maybe cat and dog or two cats get more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m28s)

[cats whatever](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m31s)

[but when you declare an operator on a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m33s)

[type it's a static method it's a static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m36s)

[method with a very well-defined](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m38s)

[signature and a special name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m41s)

[right so in this case we're doing the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m44s)

[plus plus operator](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m49s)

[it's an addition](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m51s)

[I might have to go and check](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m53s)

[uh should you use static for every](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m55s)

[variable uh generally not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h14m57s)

[so uh let me address that one really](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m00s)

[quick so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m04s)

[when you declare things as static by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m08s)

[definition it means there's only one of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m11s)

[them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m13s)

[and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m14s)

[when you do so static is very useful in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m16s)

[a variety of situations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m21s)

[where only one thing is necessary so for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m23s)

[example like these static math methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m26s)

[that they have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m29s)

[these are are what are called Pure](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m30s)

[methods meaning they don't have side](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m33s)

[effects so I can invoke this as many](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m35s)

[times as I want this is not mutating any](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m38s)

[data it's just doing some calculations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m41s)

[and giving back a result great Statics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m43s)

[are wonderful for peer type methods or](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m46s)

[like link methods are similar those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m49s)

[types of things work well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m51s)

[if you make everything or if you use](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m53s)

[static for every variable you start to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m56s)

[run into an a situation where your code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h15m58s)

[gets very tightly coupled because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m01s)

[everything that references that static](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m03s)

[variable is now tightly coupled to that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m05s)

[variable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m08s)

[um and it ends up uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m09s)

[uh being problematic and it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m12s)

[it's not a bad thing to be coupled to a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m15s)

[pure method because there's no side](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m17s)

[effects to it but the moment you start](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m19s)

[like mutating state](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m21s)

[now that's where the that coupling](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m23s)

[starts to become real problematic does](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m25s)

[having public static for easy access](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m27s)

[yeah so I would say I would separate out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m32s)

[the the concepts of public and static so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m36s)

[the public will give you easy easy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m40s)

[access because you can now reference it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m42s)

[from anywhere the static oftentimes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m44s)

[people will use for ease of access](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m46s)

[because then they don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m49s)

[about which instance am I invoking on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m51s)

[it's static means there's only one I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m53s)

[just going to that one instance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m56s)

[um static can also be problematic when](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h16m59s)

[you start getting into things like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m01s)

[threading](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m03s)

[because if there's only a single](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m04s)

[instance of something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m05s)

[um and you have multiple threads that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m08s)

[want to access it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m10s)

[you now have to deal with synchronizing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m12s)

[that access from multiple threads which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m14s)

[if if you're just starting out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m18s)

[declare everything public static go for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m21s)

[it what um I've helped teach classes at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m23s)

[the University level for C sharp and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m26s)

[oftentimes when we're first teaching](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m29s)

[students That's How we'll have them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m30s)

[declare things is public static because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m33s)

[that's the easiest way to write code and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m36s)

[get going the moment you start building](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m38s)

[any sort of complex level application](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m40s)

[though you'll want to start separating](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m43s)

[out things that should be static from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m45s)

[things that shouldn't be and generally](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m48s)

[things that should not be static are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m51s)

[things that are holding on to data or](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m54s)

[doing manipulation of State](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m57s)

[and what that means varies from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h17m59s)

[application to application](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m03s)

[and static methods generally should be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m04s)

[anything that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m06s)

[is a pure method so doing work but not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m09s)

[necessarily a mutating state](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m13s)

[and that's again General guidelines not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m15s)

[hard and fast rules there's exceptions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m19s)

[to a lot of these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m20s)

[but oftentimes those those are the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m22s)

[guidelines I would go for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m25s)

[um this ability here to do this on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m28s)

[interfaces really kind of muddies the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m31s)

[water](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m33s)

[right so uh a common interview question](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m34s)

[is to ask people what's the difference](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m37s)

[between an interface and an abstract](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m39s)

[base class right that was a standard](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m41s)

[object-oriented interview question that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m44s)

[um comes up quite a lot and it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m48s)

[oftentimes used to gauge like beginner](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m50s)

[intermediate level candidates for how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m53s)

[well do you know uh polymorphism how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m56s)

[well do you understand what an interface](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h18m58s)

[is used for and I used to to joke to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m00s)

[people that interfaces even before like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m03s)

[C sharp 9 10 and 11 where they added all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m07s)

[this stuff to them interfaces before](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m09s)

[that point were](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m12s)

[deceptively easy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m15s)

[like they were easy to declare easy to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m17s)

[use but I oftentimes saw people use them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m20s)

[incorrectly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m23s)

[and so it was one of those is like yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m24s)

[now you can fall into the pit they've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m26s)

[added so much stuff to interfaces it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m29s)

[really easy to fall into the pit of of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m30s)

[Despair](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m32s)

[um so not shown here you can actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m34s)

[put access modifiers on your interface](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m37s)

[members as well so public private and in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m40s)

[general I see people doing that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m43s)

[and most of the time they don't realize](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m46s)

[they're leveraging a newer language](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m49s)

[feature](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m50s)

[and it's like well I declared my method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m52s)

[that way on my class therefore I declare](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m54s)

[it this way on my interface it's like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m56s)

[probably not what you were intending](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h19m59s)

[don't do that but it because so much of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m02s)

[the syntax now works that difference](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m05s)

[between an abstract Base Class and an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m07s)

[interface especially in C sharp that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m09s)

[line is getting real blurry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m12s)

[real blurry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m14s)

[um so one if you're unfamiliar with the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m16s)

[difference between an interface and an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m19s)

[abstract bass class and when you should](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m20s)

[use each](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m22s)

[um I recommend looking it up if you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m23s)

[still unsure let me know that might make](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m25s)

[a good candidate for one of those 10](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m27s)

[minute videos](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m29s)

[I'm making a mental list of ideas](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m35s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m37s)

[uh oh so that's a great question how how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m40s)

[often do you use the the public class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m43s)

[list of T generic types uh our generic](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m45s)

[types expensive uh in C sharp no so this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m48s)

[is often generic types in C sharp often](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m53s)

[will get compared against like Java's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m56s)

[generic types or like C uh see if I can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h20m57s)

[get this right C plus plus is templates](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m01s)

[um and they're very different in all in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m04s)

[all cases and in C sharp generally you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m06s)

[actually want to use the generic types](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m10s)

[because they are less expensive than the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m11s)

[non-generic types so there there are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m15s)

[some collection types that don't require](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m18s)

[you to use generics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m21s)

[um but the generic oftentimes if you say](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m23s)

[you have a list of ins right okay small](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m26s)

[side lesson here we go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m29s)

[okay so let's imagine we've got a list](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m30s)

[so to answer your first question uh all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m34s)

[the time is how often we use generic](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m37s)

[types um and because they are typically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m40s)

[the most efficient so numbers right and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m42s)

[we'll do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m45s)

[uh let's see new to do one two three](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m47s)

[four five right so I'm if you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m51s)

[unfamiliar with this newer syntax this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m55s)

[is this is newer C sharp syntax this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m57s)

[called Target types new Expressions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h21m59s)

[um which are absolute gold when using](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m03s)

[generics uh because before we had we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m06s)

[used to have to type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m09s)

[this garbage and that was annoying and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m10s)

[then the c-sharp team gave us VAR and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m14s)

[that was better but now we can do it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m16s)

[this way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m19s)

[which is even nicer it just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m20s)

[every version of the language they keep](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m22s)

[adding features uh and it's a little bit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m24s)

[slow uh using link with generics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m27s)

[yes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m30s)

[one specific comment about Link Link in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m32s)

[the last couple versions of.net has](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m35s)

[gotten lots of love](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m37s)

[um early versions of Link](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m39s)

[um in like the net core three one-ish](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m42s)

[days and I think netcore like 2-0 days](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m49s)

[there was comments from people where for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m50s)

[Loops were faster than link statements](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m53s)

[because link statements tended to do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m56s)

[lots of memory allocations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h22m58s)

[um now the argument was usually you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m01s)

[if I do a uh numbers where right where I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m04s)

[do x uh X mod 2 equals zero right I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m08s)

[just gonna grab](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m12s)

[to list right uh VAR even numbers right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m14s)

[so if I'm just going to pull out all the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m20s)

[even numbers out of my list](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m21s)

[um there was an argument that every time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m24s)

[you use the link method because it had](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m27s)

[to allocate this delegate because it had](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m28s)

[to uh instantiate the enumerator behind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m31s)

[the scenes it was a lot more expensive](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m34s)

[now the counter argument was yeah but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m36s)

[they're a heck of a lot easier to read](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m38s)

[and they're a lot less error prone so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m40s)

[it's better to have less air prone code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m42s)

[than more memory performance code well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m44s)

[the.net team has actually significantly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m46s)

[improved the performance of Link methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m49s)

[over the last several versions because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m52s)

[because link is so common](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m54s)

[um oftentimes Microsoft looks at what's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h23m58s)

[the most common thing being used and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m00s)

[heavily optimizes that because that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m02s)

[going to make the biggest difference in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m04s)

[people's codes so link has gotten if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m05s)

[start looking at the source code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m08s)

[um it is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m10s)

[the link source code is somewhat not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m12s)

[someone it's gotten really complex](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m14s)

[um but it's all around that performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m17s)

[because programmers want to write this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m19s)

[this is easy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m21s)

[the equivalent for Loop of doing this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m23s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m26s)

[a pain in the neck and ugly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m27s)

[um and actually real quick so other](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m29s)

[thing uh edu link there is a wonderful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m31s)

[where is it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m37s)

[edu link this one so John skeet put](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m39s)

[together](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m44s)

[a wonderful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m45s)

[uh learning tutorial on link where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m47s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m51s)

[uh where she goes through and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m54s)

[re-implements all of the link methods by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m55s)

[hand](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m58s)

[so if you are interested in learning](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h24m58s)

[link it is worth noting his](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m01s)

[implementations are more akin to how](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m03s)

[link was when it was first introduced](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m06s)

[these implementations are nowhere close](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m09s)

[to what link is today](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m11s)

[but from a conceptual standpoint and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m13s)

[understanding how link works and the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m16s)

[behavior of all of these methods this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m19s)

[awesome](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m21s)

[uh let's see public volatile in storage](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m23s)

[ooh so volatile is a keyword in c-sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m26s)

[that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m30s)

[rarely see used](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m32s)

[so volatile is around uh memory fences](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m34s)

[or memory barriers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m38s)

[um you I'm trying to remember the last](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m42s)

[time I actually needed the volatile](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m44s)

[keyword](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m46s)

[I don't think](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m49s)

[I can't remember the last time I needed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m51s)

[the volatile](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m53s)

[um keyword](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m55s)

[so the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h25m59s)

[the the part about this that is the most](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m00s)

[interesting thing with with this is the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m04s)

[code that you write and the order that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m08s)

[it executes aren't guaranteed and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m10s)

[usually people freak out when they hear](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m12s)

[that and go wait the code doesn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m14s)

[execute in the order I wrote the answer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m15s)

[is sometimes no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m18s)

[no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m20s)

[obviously if the code executed in a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m21s)

[random order there would be bugs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m24s)

[everywhere and since that isn't the case](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m25s)

[we can conclude that yes even though](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m26s)

[things may be done slightly out of order](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m29s)

[what that really translates to is the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m31s)

[the IL instructions under the hood](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m34s)

[like what we saw in here these IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m37s)

[instructions may get reordered slightly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m40s)

[for performance optimizations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m42s)

[the behavior Remains the Same now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m45s)

[because of that there may come times and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m47s)

[they're pretty esoteric and they're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m51s)

[really hard to hit but you'll note this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m53s)

[volatile keyword all of the samples that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m55s)

[you're going to run into are going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m58s)

[show multi-threading because that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h26m59s)

[where it comes into play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m01s)

[because things can execute out of order](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m03s)

[and making sure that you are getting the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m05s)

[uh the correct value out of your field](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m09s)

[that's when volatile is actually used](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m12s)

[but in general](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m14s)

[you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m16s)

[you typically don't use volatile that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m18s)

[much at all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m21s)

[um if you're doing something with a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m23s)

[field and you think that you need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m25s)

[volatile generally a better solution is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m26s)

[to look at the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m29s)

[the interlocked class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m30s)

[because most of the time when people use](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m34s)

[volatile it's because what they want is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m37s)

[to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m40s)

[um basically synchronize access to a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m41s)

[field](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m43s)

[an interlocked here I'll just drop the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m45s)

[link for this is typically a better way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m48s)

[to do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m51s)

[so interlocked the the idea here is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m52s)

[these methods are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m55s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m58s)

[are Atomic meaning that they can't be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h27m59s)

[interrupted so when you're thinking](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m03s)

[about CPU instructions and executing and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m05s)

[I'll I'll point to the IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m08s)

[IL things don't necessarily correlate to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m10s)

[CPU instructions but conceptually that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m13s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m15s)

[any time what can happen is at any point](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m16s)

[your thread can get paused](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m21s)

[right because your your CPU only has so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m24s)

[many threads inside of it right like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m27s)

[I've I I think I've got a 16 core](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m30s)

[machine on my box and so I've got a ton](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m33s)

[of programs running what happens is the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m36s)

[the operating system has to schedule who](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m39s)

[gets to run on that CPU at a given time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m42s)

[oh thank you for the follow cauldron](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m44s)

[um because the operating system is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m47s)

[scheduling which threads run at a given](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m49s)

[time it means at some point in time one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m52s)

[thread has to be told okay you pause](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m54s)

[hold on it'll be your turn to come back](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m56s)

[in a second right and so my system I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h28m59s)

[don't know probably has hundreds maybe](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m02s)

[thousands of threads currently up and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m04s)

[running for all of these programs but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m07s)

[only so many of them are running on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m10s)

[CPU at any given point in time and the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m12s)

[operating system is doing all this fancy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m14s)

[switching and that's where the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m15s)

[multi-threading problem comes into play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m18s)

[because you can be Frozen at any point](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m19s)

[in time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m21s)

[and somebody else can go and muck with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m22s)

[your stuff and even once you start](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m24s)

[talking with multi uh Core computers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m26s)

[you don't even necessarily need to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m29s)

[frozen it could just be another one of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m31s)

[those guys is running at the same time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m33s)

[and mucking with your stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m34s)

[right so with a interlocked the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m36s)

[specifically the compare exchange is an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m41s)

[awesome method to become familiar with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m43s)

[because this does so this does a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m44s)

[comparison](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m47s)

[and then an exchange of values and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m49s)

[you can do a lot of stuff with this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m52s)

[because normally comparing two objects](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m54s)

[and assigning to it ends up uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h29m57s)

[uh being multiple instructions and this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m03s)

[combines it down into a single a single](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m06s)

[instruction and because it's a single](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m08s)

[instruction there's no way for somebody](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m10s)

[to muck with your data in the middle](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m12s)

[right there's only one instruction there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m14s)

[and you're guaranteed static State uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m17s)

[unsafe static void fast copy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m20s)

[uh not sure what the question is there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m25s)

[so that is potentially referring to the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m30s)

[c-sharp unsafe keyword](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m33s)

[um which that is just around enabling](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m37s)

[pointers in C sharp because generally we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m39s)

[don't have pointers okay circling back](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m41s)

[to the abstract static bits on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m44s)

[interfaces effectively what this does is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m47s)

[you can now make up methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m50s)

[and I think I like the where was that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m53s)

[blog link](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m56s)

[did I miss it had it open somewhere](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h30m58s)

[uh Explorer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m02s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m06s)

[um you can now start writing methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m08s)

[like this that act on things that are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m10s)

[number like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m12s)

[which is kind of cool right like if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m13s)

[were told to sum up the numbers but you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m16s)

[weren't sure if the numbers were going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m18s)

[to be ins Longs doubles whatever right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m19s)

[all of those things you can plus equals](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m22s)

[on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m24s)

[which is great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m25s)

[but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m27s)

[the the previously you ended up either](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m28s)

[writing overloads or or doing various](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m30s)

[stuff to try to deal with all the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m33s)

[different types now we have interfaces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m35s)

[for all of the number types and more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m39s)

[importantly those interfaces can declare](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m41s)

[operators](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m43s)

[so types that allow addition now just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m45s)

[work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m47s)

[which is pretty cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m49s)

[and it's not just the addition operator](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m51s)

[like you can see that they added a whole](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m54s)

[slew of interfaces right things that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h31m57s)

[support addition things that support](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m01s)

[bitwise operators things like support](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m02s)

[comparisons or inequalities right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m04s)

[decrements division like they basically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m07s)

[grouped all the like operators and made](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m10s)

[multiple interfaces for these things so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m12s)

[you can imagine if we look at I'm pretty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m15s)

[sure if I look at int](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m17s)

[all right if I just F12 on int](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m18s)

[right you can see I've got all of these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m22s)

[things in here that are now on it and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m24s)

[I'm looking for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m27s)

[I assume I signed number goes to yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m30s)

[this guy now has all kinds of stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m35s)

[so if we were to look at the number of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m41s)

[interfaces on any of the built-in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m43s)

[numeric types](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m46s)

[yeah you're gonna see tons of these eye](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m50s)

[number base and oh boy here we go and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m53s)

[the the interface tree just gets bigger](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h32m57s)

[and bigger and bigger so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m00s)

[very cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m02s)

[I know I've bumped into needing this at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m05s)

[points but I think the the addition of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m07s)

[generic math](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m09s)

[though really cool and helpful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m11s)

[is not nearly as cool to me as the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m14s)

[underlying feature that enables it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m17s)

[yeah I because I know I've run into](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m23s)

[situations where I want an interface to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m26s)

[declare a static member to say all all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m29s)

[types that have this interface need to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m32s)

[have the following static on them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m34s)

[which previously didn't work and didn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m36s)

[make a lot of sense and this is why](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m39s)

[interfaces are starting to become a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m40s)

[little weird](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m42s)

[right things are getting things are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m44s)

[getting real blurry about when you use](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m46s)

[you know an attached uh not an attached](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m48s)

[property an extension method or base](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m51s)

[class or whatnot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m53s)

[back to the top](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m55s)

[okay and then](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h33m58s)

[Let's Do List patterns first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m00s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m04s)

[this is one of those things that's just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m06s)

[mildly nicer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m11s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m13s)

[where do they not have a good switch](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m15s)

[expression](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m17s)

[they don't have a good switch expression](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m19s)

[this is this is better but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m23s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m29s)

[Okay so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m31s)

[let's take our new numbers thing right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m33s)

[so if I were to do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m34s)

[switch on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m37s)

[well actually I I need a s](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m39s)

[we'll just do an is right so if numbers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m42s)

[is and now I can start doing fun](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m47s)

[patterns inside of here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m50s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m52s)

[if numbers is empty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m54s)

[uh if numbers has a single element of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h34m57s)

[one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m00s)

[right uh oh ranges don't make sense here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m04s)

[I'm trying to remember this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m08s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m12s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m14s)

[inside so before pattern matching worked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m16s)

[largely you'd start with the curly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m20s)

[braces right and numbers is double curly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m22s)

[brace this was a property matching](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m25s)

[pattern that was a common way of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m27s)

[checking for null because this will](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m29s)

[match because there's no property](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m31s)

[specified here this will match on all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m33s)

[non-null objects which is convenient](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m36s)

[right it's a nice null check and then we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m39s)

[got you know is not null and that's in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m41s)

[my opinion even easier to read because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m44s)

[that's that's nicer because before we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m46s)

[didn't have the not null we only had](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m48s)

[isnal but then we got not which was cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m49s)

[and now we can actually go inside of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m51s)

[here and we can say okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m55s)

[what we would really like to do is and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h35m57s)

[I think this pattern here that they grab](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m00s)

[is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m02s)

[just absolutely astounding right like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m04s)

[this is Bonkers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m10s)

[uh is that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m12s)

[oh I don't think the dot dot is intended](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m17s)

[to be arranged there I think it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m19s)

[intended to be a pattern match](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m20s)

[uh this is interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m24s)

[sub patch into a slice pattern which the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m28s)

[following example shows](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m32s)

[uh what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m36s)

[you claim this works uh let's just do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m39s)

[this real quick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m43s)

[I want to make you an array](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m44s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m47s)

[it does not contain a definition of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m52s)

[length](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m54s)

[yeah I'm kind of surprised that this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m55s)

[would work because inside of here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h36m57s)

[the the list sub pattern match allows](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m00s)

[you to compare against](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m03s)

[uh elements of the list so rather than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m05s)

[comparing against the list instance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m08s)

[itself like the uh is double curly brace](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m10s)

[right this is checking on the numbers](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m15s)

[instance directly sometimes what you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m17s)

[want is actually pattern matches on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m19s)

[elements of the list](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m22s)

[which is a little bit nicer so for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m24s)

[example we want to compare is my set of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m27s)

[actually this looks remarkably similar](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m30s)

[right is my set of numbers equal to one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m32s)

[two three is it equal to one two three](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m36s)

[four is it equal to one two three four](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m38s)

[you'll note this is not the sub pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m41s)

[a bit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m43s)

[um but inside of here we can start to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m45s)

[say okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m48s)

[are the elements 0 or 1 or less than two](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m49s)

[greater than three right like you can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m54s)

[start to or I should say is the first](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m57s)

[element zero one is the next element](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h37m59s)

[less than two and is the third element](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m02s)

[greater than or equal to three](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m04s)

[right so you can start to build up these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m07s)

[list patterny things and then they do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m09s)

[have a grab me the let oh the dot dot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m12s)

[that's what it is which is grab me the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m17s)

[rest](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m19s)

[so it's I only want to match on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m20s)

[first little bit and the dot dot is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m23s)

[going to be everything else in the list](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m25s)

[because you know a list can have an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m27s)

[arbitrary number of things in it let's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m28s)

[just go ahead and grab all of those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m31s)

[so again useful but feels like one of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m34s)

[those use cases where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m37s)

[all of these examples feel very](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m40s)

[contrived and I will be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m42s)

[again this is one of those I feel like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m45s)

[I've got use cases for this on real](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m46s)

[projects](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m48s)

[just can't think of one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m49s)

[but I've never had the power before](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m52s)

[okay last last thing in here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m55s)

[and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h38m59s)

[then we'll take a a brief Gander over at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m01s)

[the the stuff in the framework so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m03s)

[required members](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m05s)

[it why is it the things that have the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m08s)

[shortest paragraphs or the things I'm](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m10s)

[the most excited about](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m11s)

[okay so you can add the required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m13s)

[modifier to properties and Fields to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m16s)

[enforce Constructors and colors to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m18s)

[initialize those values](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m20s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m25s)

[and then you can slap an attribute on a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m26s)

[Constructor to inform the compiler that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m29s)

[a Constructor initializes all members](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m31s)

[interesting okay so I'm curious as to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m36s)

[how this is going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m38s)

[so I kind of want to try this let's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m43s)

[let's make us a type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m45s)

[let's make us a type so we're going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m46s)

[come over here uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m48s)

[uh public class I keep using cats so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m51s)

[we're going to go with cat](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m53s)

[uh public](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m55s)

[required string name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h39m59s)

[right so I want that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m03s)

[required must be setable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m09s)

[okay so we can either go within a knit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m11s)

[or a set let's just do let's just do set](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m13s)

[for now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m16s)

[okay and then if we come up here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m18s)

[uh cat C gets new right and that should](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m21s)

[give me an error](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m25s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m28s)

[object initializer or an attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m30s)

[Constructor so if I come here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m33s)

[name uh Kitty because that's that's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m35s)

[name of a cat](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m40s)

[right so that works](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m41s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m45s)

[so this is interest so this is actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m47s)

[kind of nice because before](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m49s)

[you could have an init member but there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m51s)

[was no way to guarantee that somebody](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m54s)

[actually said it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m56s)

[this is a little bit nicer specifically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h40m59s)

[for nullable reference types right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m01s)

[because before without this guy if I did](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m04s)

[this and I declared this non-nullable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m07s)

[sup Robert not WPF tonight though C](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m11s)

[sharp 11 which is no less cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m14s)

[right so if I declare this non-nullable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m20s)

[and I try to set it to null](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m22s)

[I appropriately get a warning right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m25s)

[nullable reference types is enabled](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m28s)

[which is this nullable attribute here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m30s)

[and on all new projects you should](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m33s)

[definitely leave it enabled it is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m34s)

[wonderful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m38s)

[so when I appropriately get a thing here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m40s)

[but you'll note down here I'm also](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m43s)

[getting a warning because there is no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m45s)

[way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m48s)

[for uh the compiler to validate that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m49s)

[name is always set](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m52s)

[right because in the event that I just](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m55s)

[do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h41m58s)

[C dot name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m00s)

[you know dot length or whatever this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m02s)

[throws a no reference now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m05s)

[because the default value of string even](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m07s)

[though string is declared non-nullable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m09s)

[still is still a reference type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m12s)

[and still defaults to null](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m15s)

[right and so there's various ways around](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m18s)

[this right like you could default to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m19s)

[empty string but that's kind of annoying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m21s)

[it's like well I kind of want somebody](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m24s)

[to provide it I can do it with a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m26s)

[Constructor right string name but now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m28s)

[that means everybody has to call it in a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m31s)

[Constructor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m33s)

[right and sometimes it's nicer to break](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m38s)

[things up across properties versus](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m40s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m45s)

[versus having to always specify you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m47s)

[name here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m50s)

[Kitty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m53s)

[right because if I want to have a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m55s)

[default Constructor now too](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m56s)

[right so I've got a default Constructor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h42m58s)

[in addition to my other one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m01s)

[my default Constructor now gives me a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m03s)

[warning saying hang on hang on you've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m05s)

[got a name property and you didn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m07s)

[initialize it to anything World crazy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m08s)

[it's like but I've gotten a knit member](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m11s)

[don't worry about it right like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m13s)

[cat C2 new](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m15s)

[right so name equals other Kitty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m19s)

[right so even though I've created two](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m26s)

[cat instances they both have their name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m28s)

[non-null I still get a warning here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m31s)

[except for now I can deal with this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m34s)

[warning in a new way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m36s)

[right because before we used to have to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m38s)

[do something dumb where we like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m39s)

[initialized named empty string but now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m41s)

[we can do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m43s)

[oh and this is where the attribute comes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m51s)

[into play](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m53s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m54s)

[cat name must be set in the object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h43m57s)

[initializer or attribute Constructor oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m00s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m04s)

[on the second object creation the object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m08s)

[is created and then the property is set](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m10s)

[correct yes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m12s)

[yes even though I'm using an object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m13s)

[initializer this is functionally](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m15s)

[equivalent to C2 dot name equals](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m17s)

[other Kitty](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m23s)

[this is just shorthand for setting a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m25s)

[bunch of properties](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m31s)

[and it's actually the only way so even](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m33s)

[though it's functionally equivalent you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m35s)

[can't actually replace them because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m37s)

[there's a small but important difference](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m39s)

[here is this one is an init setter](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m41s)

[which means this guy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m44s)

[can assign to it but this guy can't now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m47s)

[if this was a set](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m50s)

[then you'd be golden in both cases but a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m52s)

[knit is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m54s)

[only available inside of a Constructor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m56s)

[or an object initializer once you get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h44m58s)

[past that initialization phase the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m01s)

[compiler doesn't know that you're going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m04s)

[to assign to the property later on so it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m05s)

[can't check it whereas an object](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m08s)

[initializer gives it some scoping of and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m09s)

[scoping is the wrong word because scope](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m12s)

[means something different uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m14s)

[the object initializer has a well-known](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m17s)

[endpoint that's a we'll go with that so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m21s)

[the compiler knows one once we've gotten](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m24s)

[past the initialization portion of this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m27s)

[um it is interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m30s)

[so if you do this you end up having to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m33s)

[do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m36s)

[what was the name of that attribute I've](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m37s)

[already forgotten it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m39s)

[sets required members](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m40s)

[and Christine okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m44s)

[what happens if I do something else](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m47s)

[yeah like that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m52s)

[thank you co-pilot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m53s)

[you're amazing thank you for writing all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m56s)

[my code for me uh cat C3 gets](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h45m58s)

[new and I want to go with Kitty and 42](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m03s)

[because this is going to be an old cat](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m08s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m10s)

[so do I have to decorate this on all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m14s)

[oh this is kind of problematic because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m21s)

[what happens if I do this and I do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m24s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m28s)

[uh int age](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m30s)

[oh this is this is actually kind of bad](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m37s)

[chain the constructors yeah like that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m40s)

[the fix](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m43s)

[right like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m46s)

[in reality you should you should do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m48s)

[exactly what you're suggesting right of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m50s)

[you know name and then you know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m53s)

[reasonable default](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m55s)

[but no it doesn't catch it that's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h46m58s)

[that's what's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m01s)

[that's what's weirding me out right no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m02s)

[warning](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m04s)

[right this one is called this one even](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m06s)

[though age is marked as required and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m09s)

[have no idea why Visual Studio has lost](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m11s)

[its mind on the color coding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m17s)

[even though age is marked as required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m17s)

[this isn't caught](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m22s)

[because this is not setting age](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m25s)

[That's mildly terrifying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m31s)

[like I really appreciate this feature](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m36s)

[but I yeah yeah yeah like and I get it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m39s)

[like inside of the compiler it's really](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m44s)

[easy to put together simple examples](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m46s)

[like this where it's like yeah the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m48s)

[compiler should know about this but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m50s)

[there's plenty of examples where this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m52s)

[gets real complicated inside the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m54s)

[Constructor and it may not be obvious](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m55s)

[and most of the compiler stuff where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h47m58s)

[it's doing analysis it has very low](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m01s)

[depth levels like it doesn't recurse](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m04s)

[four or five layers into your code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m07s)

[it J like the noble reference types I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m10s)

[think it's only one or two levels deep](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m12s)

[like it only is looking within the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m14s)

[current method and the invocation and no](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m17s)

[deeper it doesn't it doesn't keep](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m19s)

[recursing and going well I know that if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m21s)

[I run through all the paths that this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m23s)

[thing is actually non-null so I'm going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m25s)

[to treat it that like no it doesn't do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m27s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m28s)

[it's much it's much more naive and won't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m29s)

[run that deep because there would be a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m32s)

[huge performance penalty from doing that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m34s)

[this is really cool and it's like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m38s)

[it's like 90 of the way of what I want](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m42s)

[because I want this to flag here too](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m45s)

[like this thing doesn't have a list of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m51s)

[members on it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m53s)

[needless to say thank you for the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m56s)

[subscription](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h48m58s)

[man that is so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m01s)

[that is so bad so bad](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m04s)

[okay so we're gonna do one more thing uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m09s)

[public class kitten right and a kitten](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m12s)

[is gonna derive from a cat because a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m17s)

[kitten is a special cat](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m19s)

[right so what happens](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m21s)

[what happens if I do this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m26s)

[cat C4](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m30s)

[gets new kitten](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m32s)

[okay that's good](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m40s)

[that's good](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m42s)

[oh thank you Robert I appreciate it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m44s)

[eight months in a row](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m47s)

[so so it does appropriately flag that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m51s)

[kitten isn't doing anything right but if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m54s)

[I make this guy here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m56s)

[invoke](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h49m58s)

[base and pass an empty string](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m01s)

[oh okay so this is this is mildly nicer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m06s)

[this Constructor must add okay so if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m10s)

[have a derived Constructor and you call](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m14s)

[into the base you also have to set the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m17s)

[attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m19s)

[okay so that fixes part of it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m21s)

[so you can't abuse it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m25s)

[you can't abuse it as easily with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m27s)

[inheritance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m30s)

[but if you do overload your Constructors](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m34s)

[you got to be real diligent about when](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m36s)

[you apply the required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m38s)

[what do you call this required at I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m41s)

[can't use required attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m43s)

[what do we call it required modifier](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m45s)

[so when you apply the required modifier](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m51s)

[you have to be real diligent to go and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m55s)

[check your Constructors](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m57s)

[and with this attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h50m59s)

[because if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m01s)

[change this attribute on a class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m03s)

[inheritance now let's do interfaces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m06s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m10s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m13s)

[though this attribute is only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m15s)

[what is the the spec on this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m19s)

[it's only valid on Constructors so you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m22s)

[couldn't decorate it interface with this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m25s)

[currently Constructors are not yet valid](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m28s)

[on interfaces](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m31s)

[the moment they are all like I'm going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m33s)

[to question the point of an interface](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m35s)

[we've already got static and abstract](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m36s)

[and virtual we're getting there we're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m39s)

[getting there interfaces are this close](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m41s)

[thingies](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m45s)

[we're getting real close to it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m46s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m50s)

[that is interesting though okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m52s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h51m55s)

[I'll have to think so intellitech we put](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m04s)

[together coding guidelines](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m06s)

[and we're in the process of updating](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m08s)

[them for C sharp 11 stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m10s)

[and I am not sure like the best coding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m13s)

[guideline I can come up with here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m17s)

[is any time you you modify a required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m20s)

[modifier or the or the set required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m23s)

[members attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m26s)

[you need to review the the other uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m29s)

[required members and Constructors in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m33s)

[your class to make sure that this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m35s)

[still true](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m38s)

[right if you decorate this thing with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m40s)

[required members](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m43s)

[you need to make sure that you have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m45s)

[actually assigned all required members](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m47s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m49s)

[it's better than not having it because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m50s)

[at least the amount of spots the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m53s)

[programmer has to look at are all going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m55s)

[to be constrained to this one class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m57s)

[right heaven forbid you have a class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h52m59s)

[with like 100 of these that would be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m01s)

[horrible to check that would be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m03s)

[miserable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m05s)

[like I do wish that there was a slightly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m09s)

[more checking on this to say hey if I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m12s)

[put this on a Constructor and I haven't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m14s)

[actually handled it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m16s)

[please yell at me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m18s)

[I guess it couldn't actually validate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m20s)

[that though right because theoretically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m22s)

[this thing this thing would be very](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m24s)

[valid if I did you know Age Two here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m27s)

[right so it couldn't flag the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m31s)

[Constructor with this attribute on it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m33s)

[because it doesn't actually know](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m34s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m43s)

[how do you end up doing that then](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m45s)

[it feels like the failure case is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m48s)

[combining](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m50s)

[init level stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m52s)

[and constructory stuff like if it comes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h53m57s)

[in via the Constructor I would almost](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m00s)

[propose setting it up this way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m02s)

[and then avoiding this this attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m07s)

[altogether because now you appropriately](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m10s)

[flag](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m13s)

[right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m19s)

[because if it's a read-only property](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m24s)

[it's now only assignable in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m26s)

[Constructor it gets a little annoying](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m28s)

[but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m29s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m31s)

[yeah that that I I can see it now this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m33s)

[feature is going to be a major](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m36s)

[discussion point](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m37s)

[for coding guidelines of when and how to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m39s)

[use it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m41s)

[Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m47s)

[for you Robert I know you can't see it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m50s)

[yeah here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m52s)

[you're correct my sanity was probably](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h54m58s)

[depleting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m00s)

[Mountain Dew re-engaged](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m02s)

[okay so that is the c-sharp 11 language](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m05s)

[features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m09s)

[so just to be clear if if you're if the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m11s)

[developers and your build agents for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m15s)

[your pipelines are all able to update to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m17s)

[c-sharp 11.](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m20s)

[which means the the latest SDK](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m23s)

[do it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m26s)

[framework](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m29s)

[see earlier in the video or recording](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m30s)

[of of doing it so this is now what is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m34s)

[new in the net 7 framework and I'll once](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m37s)

[again here let me drop](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m41s)

[uh for people interested let me clean up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m43s)

[the links so that it's actually pointed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m47s)

[at non](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m49s)

[language-based links](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m51s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m54s)

[So Pro tip you'll note the links that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m56s)

[I'm sharing all I'm doing is deleting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h55m59s)

[this en US so all the Microsoft links if](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m01s)

[you drop that out of the link](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m04s)

[um it will tell uh the browser to infer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m06s)

[the user's local language and if it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m09s)

[one that's supported it'll automatically](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m10s)

[flip into it so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m12s)

[for what it's worth and language being](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m15s)

[like spoken language like English not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m17s)

[this language that's programming](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m21s)

[language](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m23s)

[okay uh let's see so performance is a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m24s)

[key thing here uh yes and let me let me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m28s)

[grab it here real quick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m31s)

[so there was a slide that got shared day](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m34s)

[one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m38s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m39s)

[I screenshot it because it was so cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m41s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m45s)

[I'm just gonna](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m45s)

[drag this over here right so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m47s)

[this is upgrading to.net six](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m52s)

[right so this isn't even.net seven but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m55s)

[this is Microsoft saying hey we build on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h56m59s)

[our own stuff let us show you these are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m01s)

[absolutely insane numbers in my opinion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m10s)

[uh of just the amount of performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m12s)

[gains going up to net six](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m15s)

[so when in doubt the latest versions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m19s)

[gain a ton of performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m22s)

[right and so there are a a ton of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m25s)

[performance improvements in uh net 7. uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m28s)

[this is an uh some of the areas that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m33s)

[I've been actually Keen to play around](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m34s)

[with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m36s)

[um around the uh what is it improved](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m38s)

[code gen for arm 64. Where is the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m42s)

[sorry I'm looking for a specific bit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m45s)

[that I read earlier](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m48s)

[uh uh oh there so it's hiding under the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m51s)

[native aot so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h57m57s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m00s)

[so you can so one of the things that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m00s)

[can do with uh net seven stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m03s)

[is preemptively compiled against](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m07s)

[different architectures so rather than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m10s)

[like the any CPU if you know what you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m12s)

[doing uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m14s)

[you can uh publish out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m16s)

[and Target the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m20s)

[desired platform ahead of time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m26s)

[and theoretically it's easy so you'll](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m28s)

[note like when this publish command is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m30s)

[running they're intentionally targeting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m32s)

[one of the runtime identifiers the rids](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m34s)

[so 64-bit Windows Linux arm 64.](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m37s)

[um this also adds in uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m41s)

[I guess it's not here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m46s)

[uh it also requires apps to be trimmed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m48s)

[so one of the things that was added](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m51s)

[finisher was added in net six I might](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m56s)

[have to double check is app trimming the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h58m57s)

[idea being that uh it will inspect the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m00s)

[code that you're invoking and trim off](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m03s)

[everything that you want because the.net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m06s)

[framework is a big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m08s)

[and most apps are not using all of it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m10s)

[like ever I most apps are using some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m13s)

[subset of it and so quite often we can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m16s)

[just trim off all of the bits that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m19s)

[aren't needed now the problem is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m21s)

[figuring out what bits aren't needed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m23s)

[that can be trimmed off and so finding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m24s)

[libraries that have that are already](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m27s)

[built to be trim friendly which usually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m30s)

[means avoiding certain Reflections and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m33s)

[various bits there is a entire document](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m35s)

[somewhere buried in here about how to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m39s)

[make your libraries and apps trim](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m43s)

[friendly so they can be reduced in size](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m45s)

[so if if aot is interesting to you uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m47s)

[definitely read up on that one because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m53s)

[that is helpful uh let's see performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m55s)

[improvements to Mono which Powers Blazer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=01h59m58s)

[webassembly Android iOS apps great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m00s)

[so short version Net 7 goes muchos](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m04s)

[faster](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m07s)

[we like we like speed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m12s)

[uh okay system text.json more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m13s)

[customization great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m16s)

[um so worth noting so the two Json](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m19s)

[systems in.net now there's newtonsoft](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m22s)

[which for a long time was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m25s)

[the top downloaded nuget package and a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m28s)

[large bit of that was because it was the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m31s)

[Json serializer for asp.net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m34s)

[um Microsoft built their own Json](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m38s)

[serialization Library](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m40s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m42s)

[not necessarily in competition and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m43s)

[think](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m47s)

[the author of newtonsoft actually helped](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m48s)

[them build this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m52s)

[so now there's a bit of a a choice that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m53s)

[you get to make system.text.json](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m55s)

[tends to be more performant but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h00m58s)

[newtonsoft.json has more features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m00s)

[so the question is do you need features](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m03s)

[or do you need raw performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m04s)

[and you kind of have to pick one or the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m08s)

[other obviously they're adding more](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m10s)

[features to it but I don't think they'll](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m12s)

[ever hit feature parity because some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m14s)

[features are just a performance set and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m15s)

[for default asp.net core Microsoft is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m18s)

[wanting it to be as fast as possible](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m22s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m25s)

[um this one is actually pretty cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m27s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m30s)

[the polymorphic serialization because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m30s)

[this was something theoretically very](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m33s)

[problematic](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m35s)

[um is the native aot related Mount uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m37s)

[Maui or totally different](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m40s)

[um it is not Maui specific](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m42s)

[so you can actually leverage it for a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m45s)

[variety of different apps so WPF console](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m48s)

[applications](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m51s)

[um the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m54s)

[two here and I can just link straight](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m55s)

[into this article if you're interested](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h01m57s)

[so this all comes down to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m00s)

[um setting up the appropriate settings](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m04s)

[on your CS branch](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m05s)

[and then calling.net publish](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m09s)

[and the the key thing here though is you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m15s)

[do have to specifically call out which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m18s)

[runtimes you want to Target so if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m21s)

[actually want to build a version of your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m23s)

[app that's you know x86 windows and x64](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m25s)

[windows and Linux you have to comp you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m28s)

[have to do the.net publish on each of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m32s)

[those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m33s)

[right you have to actually build for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m35s)

[each of those Target architectures](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m37s)

[before it's going to work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m38s)

[it means that each of those ones is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m41s)

[going to be a smaller binary than if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m43s)

[were to just compile the any CPU runtime](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m46s)

[so worth checking out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m51s)

[ah this is another one that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m55s)

[go play with really quick so regular](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h02m57s)

[Expressions now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m00s)

[because I have to I have to share it uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m02s)

[x k c d regex if you haven't seen this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m04s)

[one you should it's one of the early](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m08s)

[ones it's pretty much gold](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m10s)

[all right so he slides in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m14s)

[Pearl saves the day with regular](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m17s)

[Expressions now the corollary joke that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m19s)

[always goes along with this is when you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m21s)

[solve a problem with regular Expressions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m23s)

[now you have two problems so take that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m25s)

[with a grain of salt as well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m28s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m30s)

[but what they did](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m32s)

[is they added this cool new breakthrough](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m35s)

[expression Source generator and this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m38s)

[what I wanted to show uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m40s)

[yeah non-back tracking yada yada yada](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m47s)

[that's all on how the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m53s)

[State machine in regex works](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m54s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m56s)

[is very interesting and can make](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h03m58s)

[performance things go faster I'm not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m00s)

[interested in that I am interested in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m02s)

[the source generator for the compiled](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m04s)

[regular expressions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m06s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m09s)

[yeah this guy here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m14s)

[so previously you had to write out your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m17s)

[regexes and it was quite common to take](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m21s)

[your regex classes and store them in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m23s)

[Statics](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m25s)

[um because the building of the regex](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m27s)

[specifically The regex's Constructor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m29s)

[oftentimes uh if it was done inside of a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m32s)

[loop could could end up being a bit of a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m35s)

[performance bottleneck now a lot of that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m38s)

[has been addressed in recent versions](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m40s)

[but that's why you will often see this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m42s)

[pattern here is building up of that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m44s)

[regex because the the regex class has to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m46s)

[parse this pattern to to figure out what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m49s)

[it's doing and the parsing of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m52s)

[pattern depending on how complex and big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m55s)

[your pattern is took time and you didn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m57s)

[want to do you didn't want to do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h04m59s)

[partion of the pattern every single time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m01s)

[that was a bunch of work](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m03s)

[so people would do it once cash it in a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m05s)

[static right set compiled ignore case](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m08s)

[whatever now we have this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m11s)

[and this is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m17s)

[so you declare a partial so partial](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m22s)

[methods in C sharp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m25s)

[kind of got their they they existed for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m27s)

[a long time and then when Source](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m30s)

[generators came into play they got a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m32s)

[nice bump because now partial methods](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m34s)

[actually served a bit more of a purpose](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m37s)

[because the source generators are often](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m39s)

[generating files alongside](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m42s)

[files they generate I'll call them](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m45s)

[virtual files they are actual files on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m48s)

[disk unless you set some properties but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m50s)

[they kind of generate files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m53s)

[um but they're generating more uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m57s)

[partials to your existing classes and so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h05m59s)

[this partial method here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m01s)

[if you invoke it does nothing right and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m04s)

[previously you couldn't have a partial](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m07s)

[method that was non-void](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m08s)

[and with Source generators they relax](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m10s)

[that requirement they're like well tell](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m12s)

[you what we'll allow non-void returns](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m14s)

[um but we'll throw an error if none of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m18s)

[the generators actually populate uh an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m20s)

[implementation because a partial method](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m23s)

[just says okay I'm going to declare the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m25s)

[method here and some other par some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m28s)

[other partial to this class will](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m31s)

[actually provide the implementation for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m32s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m35s)

[and normally it's like well why would](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m35s)

[you do that why wouldn't you just write](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m37s)

[the implementation in place well the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m38s)

[only reason for that is things like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m40s)

[Source generators that might be building](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m41s)

[out that method for you on the fly but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m43s)

[you still want to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m45s)

[um have it declared now previously](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m47s)

[before Source generators when the rule](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m50s)

[was that this was void what would happen](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m52s)

[was if nothing implemented that partial](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m54s)

[method the compiler would just strip it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h06m57s)

[out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m00s)

[because it was void returning there was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m01s)

[never an assignment or anything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m04s)

[the compiler would just yank it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m06s)

[and you wouldn't have that method call](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m08s)

[or if something populated the partial](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m10s)

[then you would get it and so it was kind](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m12s)

[of common with like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m14s)

[um pre-processor directives like your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m16s)

[pound if debug](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m18s)

[um to have you know maybe I'll have this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m20s)

[partial method that does some logging](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m22s)

[but I'll only do it in debug and all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m24s)

[that kind of jazz and there's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m26s)

[conditional attribute and this kind of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m27s)

[stuff but this kind of thing is rather](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m29s)

[slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m31s)

[because now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m33s)

[it can pre-compile your regex instance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m36s)

[for you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m38s)

[it's not doing New regex Rather Source](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m42s)

[generator is emitting c-sharp code as a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m44s)

[custom derived regex implementation oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m47s)

[that is slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m51s)

[that is slick okay so regex for people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m54s)

[unfamiliar with this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m58s)

[um it bill so most regex engines build](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h07m59s)

[up a state machine and actually that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m03s)

[this article here from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m06s)

[Stephen Taub is actually probably we're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m09s)

[gonna we're gonna pick on this thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m11s)

[very simple right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m13s)

[uh where does he show his regex pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m15s)

[uh whatever so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m19s)

[as it's as it's processing effectively](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m21s)

[the regex engine is uh walking through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m24s)

[that state machine trying to decide okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m27s)

[is this string that I'm matching again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m29s)

[something that fulfills my pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m31s)

[um and there's all kinds of things to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m34s)

[discuss here with like regex syntax is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m36s)

[it greedy is it non-greedy all of that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m38s)

[but at the end of the day it's really](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m39s)

[just evaluating the string to say does](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m41s)

[it fulfill this pattern or does some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m43s)

[portion of this string fulfill this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m46s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m48s)

[um and recall my comment from before was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m51s)

[the the reason why](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m53s)

[we built up these static regex uh fields](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h08m56s)

[to hold this is because parsing of this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m00s)

[pattern took some time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m02s)

[this is remarkable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m06s)

[um because rather than](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m10s)

[the regex engine parsing this pattern at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m13s)

[run time it's parsing it at compile time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m16s)

[and this that same sort of State machine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m21s)

[that it would be building at runtime it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m23s)

[builds at compile time and emits it as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m25s)

[straight C sharp code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m28s)

[that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m33s)

[that is frankly amazing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m38s)

[oh wait a minute does it seriously have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m43s)

[okay we're doing this we I I gotta see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m48s)

[this intellisense this is just too slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m50s)

[so should show it to me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m52s)

[the the visual studio where'd you go](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h09m57s)

[come back boom okay so let's imagine I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m00s)

[want to do this reg XC thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m02s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m04s)

[okay generator regex great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m05s)

[you'll know when I pasted it Visual](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m08s)

[Studio is getting really smart](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m10s)

[added the using statement for me thank](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m12s)

[you very much okay so what do you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m14s)

[require do I have to specify a language](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m17s)

[that required](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m21s)

[where were they getting oh that's where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m27s)

[it gets it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m30s)

[okay this is even cooler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m32s)

[so on your partial method you get some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m36s)

[really slick intellisense if you hover](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m38s)

[on it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m41s)

[matches a character in The set capital a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m44s)

[lowercase a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m47s)

[then it matches on a character in The](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m49s)

[set b or B](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m51s)

[that's cool so it's showing you that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m55s)

[that it's effectively matching case](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h10m57s)

[insensitive ABC case insensitive Def and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m00s)

[those are ored together](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m04s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m07s)

[ah that is that is pretty much amazing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m10s)

[um and if we look hang on stop it stop](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m15s)

[it don't help me we go into our analyzes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m17s)

[what we should find here is underneath](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m20s)

[our regular expression generator we](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m22s)

[expand it out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m24s)

[expand it out we can see that it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m26s)

[generated this thingy here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m28s)

[so this is this is because it generated](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m33s)

[the uh XML docs for the method that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m36s)

[how we're getting that that prettiness](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m39s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m43s)

[is pretty slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m45s)

[so what did it actually do under the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m48s)

[hood](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m50s)

[so hold on regex oh and look at that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m51s)

[they're using the file bit](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m54s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h11m56s)

[I could have sworn the regex class used](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m00s)

[to be sealed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m03s)

[I could have sworn it used to be sealed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m06s)

[you'll note the derived class that they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m08s)

[make for it is file scoped](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m10s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m14s)

[which is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m16s)

[now just straight up abusing that and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m19s)

[they can get away with this because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m21s)

[there's going to be no conflicts because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m24s)

[this is file based which is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m27s)

[see there's the good use case right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m31s)

[bioscoped classes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m34s)

[regex pattern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m36s)

[builds a runner Factory so this is all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m40s)

[just setting up the internals of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m43s)

[regex class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m45s)

[wait is this stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m47s)

[protected internal interesting okay I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m51s)

[have to go and look I don't think that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m54s)

[this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m56s)

[I don't I I'm convinced there must have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h12m58s)

[been a change to this class](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m01s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m09s)

[uh let's look at reference source](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m13s)

[protected internal so it's been this way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m24s)

[for a while](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m26s)

[interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m29s)

[so reference source you'll note is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m32s)

[targeted back on.net framework for eight](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m34s)

[so occasionally I will switch between](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m39s)

[these two just to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m40s)

[just to get a little look at it that is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m42s)

[I did not realize this was possible](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m47s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h13m53s)

[utilities default timeout app context](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m02s)

[get data](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m05s)

[oh that is just slick they've thought of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m07s)

[everything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m10s)

[they have thought of everything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m12s)

[so there is an equivalent on app context](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m15s)

[there's a set data method as well](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m17s)

[that you could obviously use to set this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m19s)

[so if you want to set a regex default](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m26s)

[match timeout](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m28s)

[app context set data](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m30s)

[that is absolutely slick and then you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m33s)

[can see this is your the the state](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m36s)

[machine you can](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m38s)

[literally see the implementation that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m41s)

[it's going through here and once again](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m42s)

[it's acting on those spans so that it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m44s)

[avoids allocations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m46s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m51s)

[that is slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m54s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h14m59s)

[very very slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m01s)

[you can see it's just slicing these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m04s)

[things up so normally you you can almost](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m06s)

[you can conceptually think of slice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m09s)

[almost like substring](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m11s)

[but it's important to note that it like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m13s)

[it's just like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m17s)

[it's kind of like a view over a table in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m18s)

[a database it's not actually allocated](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m20s)

[it's just shifting that window that it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m22s)

[looking into](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m24s)

[okay that is cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m26s)

[all regex should be this way now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m28s)

[that is that is really slick](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m33s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m35s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m37s)

[um and then there is probably](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m38s)

[okay so a couple interesting things](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m43s)

[microseconds and nanoseconds are added](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m45s)

[I'm curious](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m49s)

[yeah microsecond and nanosecond I may](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m54s)

[need to double check a while back like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h15m57s)

[in the order of years](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m00s)

[um yeah I agree Robert it is nice to see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m02s)

[that state machine a while back I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m04s)

[remember looking at the performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m06s)

[counters in Windows](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m08s)

[and if my memory is correct they only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m10s)

[had microsecond level accuracy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m13s)

[but I wonder if other performance](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m18s)

[counters might actually get down to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m21s)

[nanoseconds it's really hard to get down](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m22s)

[to Nano's second level accuracy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m25s)

[at such a high level language like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m30s)

[the only time I've ever gotten into Nano](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m33s)

[second level accuracy was riding](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m35s)

[assembly code on a real-time chip like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m37s)

[little](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m41s)

[little like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m43s)

[getting down that tight](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m45s)

[nanosecond is not really that accurate](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m49s)

[it's pretty it's pretty tiny I but I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m52s)

[don't know if the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m57s)

[counters have that level or](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h16m58s)

[like I don't doubt that these are useful](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m02s)

[for people who are doing them to like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m04s)

[date time okay I want to add some](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m06s)

[milliseconds or that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m08s)

[right like those are very good use cases](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m10s)

[I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m13s)

[I just don't know if when reading it out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m14s)

[if that actually helps that much](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m18s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m22s)

[which is cool uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m24s)

[uh this interests me a great deal](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m31s)

[um because I've had to go into third](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m37s)

[party libraries for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m38s)

[for tar archives](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m41s)

[that's cool uh the rate limiter is a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m43s)

[slick little guy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m46s)

[that was brought in it its primary](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m49s)

[purpose was for asp.net but anytime you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m53s)

[need rate limiting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m57s)

[um it is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h17m58s)

[uh not that bad segments of 100](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m00s)

[nanoseconds is approximately the best](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m03s)

[resolution you get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m05s)

[see that doesn't surprise me that much](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m07s)

[actually 100 nanoseconds that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m13s)

[still pretty small](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m17s)

[uh uh okay uh apis to read all of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m21s)

[data from a stream](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m25s)

[yeah this one scares me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m30s)

[I guess this is a little better than the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m37s)

[Alternatives so the idea being that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m39s)

[streams when you would read them they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m41s)

[could always return less data than you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m43s)

[asked for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m45s)

[um and depending on what the source of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m47s)

[the stream was that could be desirable](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m49s)

[or not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m51s)

[you do need to be a little careful with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m54s)

[all these stream things when you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m57s)

[reading stuff in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h18m58s)

[um there was a software program we were](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m00s)

[working on at one point in uh one of the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m03s)

[developers had called file read all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m05s)

[bytes uh that's really problematic when](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m07s)

[end users provide the files and then](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m09s)

[they feed you some massive four gig file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m11s)

[uh that bad don't do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m14s)

[so don't read all the bytes in a file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m17s)

[you probably don't need that much that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m20s)

[many bytes loaded in any way](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m22s)

[like it's really not likely that you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m24s)

[need that much](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m27s)

[plus one for date only yes yeah so these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m28s)

[ones are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m32s)

[like this has always felt something](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m35s)

[really awkward where you would end up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m37s)

[using a date time object when you only](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m39s)

[needed half of it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m41s)

[like that was always really annoying uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m44s)

[I do find so this type here actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m48s)

[made me laugh when I first saw the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m50s)

[name of it uh where's half](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m52s)

[there's half converter but there's the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m58s)

[uh yeah and then you're stuck formatted](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h19m59s)

[every single time exactly uh one of you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m01s)

[in here has a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m05s)

[show me a link now I just wanna](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m08s)

[just a half type](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m11s)

[there is a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m14s)

[so there's a new there's a new floating](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m17s)

[Point type called half](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m19s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m22s)

[there take me there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m24s)

[yeah it's a half Precision floating](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m27s)

[Point number](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m29s)

[right so if you need](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m33s)

[because float is 32 bits double is 64.](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m36s)

[so naturally we need a 16. the thing is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m40s)

[like I suspect I probably only ever use](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m43s)

[this for interrupt scenarios](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m47s)

[because the number of times I pick float](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m49s)

[over double are really small to begin](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m52s)

[with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m53s)

[and maybe maybe there's better use cases](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h20m57s)

[but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m00s)

[so but we we now have half so that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m03s)

[that's cool uh metric support for memory](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m06s)

[cash great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m10s)

[um I suspect this was largely around the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m13s)

[support for adding what is it called](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m15s)

[open metrics or open telemetry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m18s)

[uh the only two](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m21s)

[uh times ever used float snails for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m24s)

[games and accuracy for rays Etc yeah I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m26s)

[can see it being helpful for math](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m28s)

[but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h21m59s)

[it for most people unless you have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h22m00s)

[kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h22m56s)

[I kind of like that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m00s)

[me I had to pause for a moment make sure](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m16s)

[I was still streaming okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m19s)

[I'm guessing I just rolled over past the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m21s)

[uh the midnight mark and it freaked out](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m23s)

[this is this is kind of cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m25s)

[to track down exactly which bits of code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m31s)

[are looking at this because attributes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m33s)

[by themselves don't do anything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m35s)

[right they're just metadata attached to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m37s)

[your code but things can use attributes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m39s)

[to add Behavior like Source generators I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m43s)

[kind of be curious which things are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m46s)

[targeting this obviously the uh the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m47s)

[regex one is probably leveraging it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m49s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m53s)

[but I'd be curious exactly what other](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m54s)

[things they're leveraging it uh let's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m57s)

[see apis to interact with JavaScript](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h23m58s)

[when running the browser or webassembly](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m00s)

[architectures this one doesn't surprise](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m02s)

[me there's a huge push for the Blazer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m04s)

[interop stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m07s)

[aspect oriented room static weaving yes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m10s)

[so this one something with the that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m14s)

[doesn't surprise me at all uh let's see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m17s)

[yeah so open Telemetry better](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m24s)

[integration](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m27s)

[not shocked](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m29s)

[like they're I I've really appreciated](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m31s)

[all of these changes that have gone in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m34s)

[to try to bring](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m35s)

[the the common cases in.net](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m37s)

[um up to par and ease and easy](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m41s)

[right like plugging into Telemetry is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m44s)

[one line](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m47s)

[and I can't remember it might be in the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m49s)

[new project template so it might be zero](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m51s)

[lines](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m53s)

[which is stupid level easy uh let's see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m55s)

[dot net new CLI command creates new](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h24m59s)

[project configurations](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m01s)

[they added tab completion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m04s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m07s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m08s)

[I have talked with the PM that that runs](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m09s)

[this I am willing to make a strong bet](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m12s)

[that this is system command line](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m13s)

[yeah this is the same docs for system](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m18s)

[command line](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m20s)

[yeah so if you haven't gone through and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m24s)

[turned on Tab completion](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m27s)

[um you should do so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m30s)

[because it works for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m35s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m39s)

[so so tab completion works by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m40s)

[registering a hook in your your Terminus](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m43s)

[shell so that when you hit the Tab Key](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m46s)

[your terminal actually makes a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m48s)

[invocation out to another XE to say hey](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m51s)

[provide me the completions right by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m53s)

[default most people are familiar with](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m56s)

[the tab completing like folders and file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h25m58s)

[names and that kind of thing but it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m00s)

[doesn't have to it can do other stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m02s)

[which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m04s)

[oftentimes when you're using a uh a CLI](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m06s)

[tool if I've already typed.net install](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m09s)

[and I hit tab boy it'd be really nice to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m12s)

[have useful stuff there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m17s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m19s)

[yeah so in this case they added it to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m22s)

[net new because.net new is the one where](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m24s)

[you can add in different uh or create](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m27s)

[new files or projects with the templates](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m29s)

[so I'm guessing it just iterates through](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m31s)

[the various install templates you have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m33s)

[which is cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m34s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m36s)

[template constraints let you define the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m39s)

[context in which your templates are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m42s)

[allowed oh this sounds gold](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m43s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m48s)

[multiple forms of Authentication](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m52s)

[you can constrain your template to an](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m56s)

[operating system a template engine host](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h26m58s)

[and installed workload this is perfect](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m03s)

[because I have been mentioning wanting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m06s)

[to build some default WPF templates for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m08s)

[a file new project because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m12s)

[I do it a bunch for my samples and it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m13s)

[would be really nice to have one that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m16s)

[followed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m17s)

[the standard pattern that I do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m19s)

[this is cool](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m23s)

[this is cool this is very much a niche](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m27s)

[use case for people making templates but](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m31s)

[I am one of those people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m34s)

[so I care a great deal uh publish to a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m36s)

[container yes yes this is this is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m39s)

[awesome too](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m43s)

[I should have called this one out so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m45s)

[um you can do uh so this one actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m48s)

[came out back in August](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m51s)

[uh and Chet has a wonderful article here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m53s)

[but so for people who are doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m56s)

[containerized stuff right the standard](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h27m59s)

[flow that you used to do is net build](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m01s)

[compiles the thing.net publish gives you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m03s)

[your your output artifacts and then](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m06s)

[Docker build right to to package all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m08s)

[those things up in a container unless](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m12s)

[you're already in the container doing](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m13s)

[the.net commands for the build and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m14s)

[publish whatever right either way you're](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m16s)

[running Docker commands you no longer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m18s)

[need docker](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m21s)

[to make a container](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m23s)

[this is awesome](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m25s)

[right I'll say that again you no longer](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m27s)

[need Docker to build a container because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m30s)

[Docker did a wonderful thing right they](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m33s)

[they went through all of the the effort](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m36s)

[to make it a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m38s)

[a nice standard that other people could](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m40s)

[Implement it's just that most people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m42s)

[didn't bother because why we have Docker](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m44s)

[it's great the problem is you have to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m46s)

[have Docker installed and that's yet one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m48s)

[more thing inside of the.net ecosystem](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m49s)

[that you had to get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m52s)

[that wasn't necessarily it didn't feel](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m55s)

[in the Box](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m57s)

[it worked great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h28m59s)

[but it wasn't necessarily in the box now](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m01s)

[with net publish](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m03s)

[you can get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m05s)

[um your image built for you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m07s)

[and more importantly you can build the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m10s)

[image and send it straight out to your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m12s)

[um container registry](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m15s)

[right where's their sample uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m18s)

[customization base image](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m20s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m23s)

[yeah completely agreed so container base](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m25s)

[image and you get so this is the other](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m29s)

[thing that I really like is I like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m31s)

[customizing like my publish and whatnot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m33s)

[inside of my CS project](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m35s)

[being able to do this now with my image](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m38s)

[stuff too it means I get to put](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m40s)

[everything in my happy place right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m42s)

[inside of my CS project or if I get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m44s)

[really fancy my directory build.props](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m47s)

[file and mwah that way I could just drop](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m49s)

[that sucker in and be happy oh love it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m51s)

[love it love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m54s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m56s)

[yeah CI Pipelines](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h29m58s)

[see this is nice but this isn't quite](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m04s)

[this article is slightly older than what](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m09s)

[they demoed so this was demo day one of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m12s)

[dot net comp](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m15s)

[and if you set up all of the properties](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m18s)

[in your CS proj](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m20s)

[if assuming I followed their demo](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m22s)

[correctly you could do net publish it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m24s)

[would build the image and send it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m28s)

[straight up to the ACR](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m29s)

[now that assumes that you've already](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m31s)

[authenticated against the ACR right](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m33s)

[you've either had to do like the AZ](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m35s)

[login or something to to do that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m37s)

[authentication ahead of time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m43s)

[yeah you can now manage common](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m47s)

[dependencies in your package so here's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m49s)

[here's the exciting part right this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m52s)

[directory package.props file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m54s)

[this has been around for a very very](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h30m56s)

[long time](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m00s)

[like this has been a feature that's been](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m01s)

[requested](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m03s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m05s)

[from the nougat team](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m06s)

[forever and in fact let me just show you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m08s)

[here's how long we've been using it here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m12s)

[so directory packages.props right what's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m15s)

[the history on this file](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m18s)

[oh wait](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m21s)

[wait where'd my history button go uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m23s)

[download delete history there you are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m27s)

[when did we first touch this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m33s)

[uh so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m36s)

[I've had this in here since November of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m37s)

[2020 and I'm pretty confident it existed](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m39s)

[uh since prior to that but this was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m43s)

[coming over when we converted away from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m46s)

[packet](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m47s)

[so this has existed for a while but it's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m48s)

[been under like preview flags and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m51s)

[whatnot so it's finally in the Box](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m53s)

[yeah so effectively the the big idea](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h31m57s)

[here is you can have one file that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m00s)

[declares all of your nuget packages and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m02s)

[the versions that they're at](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m05s)

[and then all of your projects inside of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m07s)

[that same folder](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m10s)

[rather than referencing the version of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m12s)

[the nougat package they just say the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m15s)

[name that they want right so I just say](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m16s)

[I want newtonsoft.json](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m18s)

[but for it to know the version it goes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m20s)

[up to the central management for it to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m22s)

[find the the appropriate version to get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m24s)

[which is great and this thing works](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m27s)

[basically the same way as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m29s)

[um the other directory star.props files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m33s)

[so if you want to do like it's going to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m37s)

[walk up until it finds the first one and](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m39s)

[if you want to keep doing recursive](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m41s)

[stuff you got to add an extra line in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m42s)

[there](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m46s)

[but you can also the the pinning and all](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m48s)

[kinds of other stuff so this is actually](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m51s)

[rather nice and one of the things that's](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m54s)

[been lagging behind is nice editor](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m56s)

[support and it's not clear to me](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h32m59s)

[if Visual Studio has been updated for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m04s)

[this I should double check and see](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m07s)

[because I I know that they wanted to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m09s)

[improve the tooling around this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m11s)

[and before like yes you could turn it on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m13s)

[but you had to edit the file yourself](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m15s)

[and that you got minimal help which was](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m17s)

[kind of sucky](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m19s)

[but I if they've updated the tooling to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m21s)

[go with this this would be even cooler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m23s)

[uh P invoke Source generation](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m25s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m30s)

[have they relaxed the rules for extern](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m35s)

[that would make me excited](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m40s)

[this could make me mildly excited so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m48s)

[I've got a very specialized use case](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m51s)

[where I care about this where I want to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m55s)

[declare extern methods but tell the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h33m57s)

[compiler don't worry about it I got this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m00s)

[like I want an extra method and I don't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m03s)

[want to decorate it with anything which](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m05s)

[at least prior has thrown warnings and I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m08s)

[it seems like it probably still would](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m11s)

[because they've just added](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m13s)

[a new attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m15s)

[ah ah so this is all around aot](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m22s)

[enablement okay fine sure](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m25s)

[um yeah C sharp 11.](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m29s)

[net Maui great](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m31s)

[dot net Maui is here asp.net core 7 EF](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m34s)

[core 7 Windows forms got some nice](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m37s)

[updates you'll note WPF is missing from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m41s)

[this list there wasn't any major updates](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m44s)

[to WPF you can rev yourself up to Net 7](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m46s)

[and gain all the performance stuff from](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m49s)

[under the hood but there wasn't anything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m50s)

[specific for WPF that I'm aware of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m51s)

[um](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m56s)

[yeah and the Upgrade Assistant so if you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h34m59s)

[are on an older project it is worth](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m01s)

[looking at the net Upgrade Assistant](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m03s)

[um just to see how hard it's going to be](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m06s)

[to upgrade yourself off of it the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m08s)

[biggest hurdles are if you're on an old](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m10s)

[CS proj file so if you double click on](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m12s)

[your CS proj file and it collapses](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m16s)

[rather than opens a file you're on the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m18s)

[old one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m20s)

[right that's usually the hardest upgrade](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m22s)

[and there's two paths forward the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m24s)

[Upgrade Assistant](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m26s)

[um generally can do a pretty good job](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m28s)

[the other thing is you delete your old](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m30s)

[CS project file you make a brand new one](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m32s)

[and you just import all your source code](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m36s)

[or at least put it in the same folder](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m39s)

[and as long as your old one didn't have](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m41s)

[a ton of customization you're probably](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m43s)

[fine](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m45s)

[yeah that's what I did delete the old CS](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m46s)

[project make a new one it for most](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m48s)

[projects that's the path of least](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m50s)

[resistance because this SDK attribute](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m52s)

[brings in all of the magic for like okay](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m55s)

[find all the subdirectories and all the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h35m59s)

[c-sharp files in it and include those](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m00s)

[and don't include the bin and obj direct](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m02s)

[like all of those default patterns](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m04s)

[are all just bundled underneath this SDK](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m07s)

[attribute now which is great that like](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m09s)

[that's you get all of the behavior you](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m11s)

[expect out of the gate and as long as](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m14s)

[your old CS project didn't do anything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m16s)

[fancy you're fine and if you're on under](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m17s)

[Source control just do it try it because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m20s)

[you can always revert](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m23s)

[if you're not under Source control make](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m25s)

[a backup copy don't don't do anything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m26s)

[too too crazy so that is everything](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m28s)

[in C sharp 11 and Net 7 at least](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m33s)

[according to these docs there's always](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m36s)

[like the little straggler](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m38s)

[Niche stuff that's off in the corner](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m40s)

[that that wasn't important enough to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m42s)

[Warrant weren't right up in these](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m45s)

[articles but this is all of the cool big](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m47s)

[stuff I will say some of this stuff](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m50s)

[makes me rather excited and I think I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m52s)

[said at the beginning there's nothing in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m54s)

[here that is like oh](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h36m56s)

[but there's a lot of quality of life](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m00s)

[stuff in here](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m02s)

[this file scope types I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m03s)

[um yeah](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m06s)

[this I feel like this is going to be the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m08s)

[one that I start to abuse and get yelled](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m10s)

[at for abusing in in bad ways because](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m12s)

[I'm sure there's ways I'm going to abuse](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m14s)

[it](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m17s)

[like that's that's gonna be kind of fun](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m18s)

[that's gonna be kind of fun because this](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m20s)

[is this is a](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m22s)

[it's it's an access modifier that's not](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m25s)

[a real access modifier](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m28s)

[so just just to clarify what I mean by](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m31s)

[that so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m34s)

[excess modifiers generally exist in your](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m35s)

[IL but this thing isn't](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m38s)

[changing the access modifiers in the IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m41s)

[like there's no file level access when](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m43s)

[you get down to the IL level there are](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m46s)

[no files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m47s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m49s)

[so the compiler is taking that](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m50s)

[interpreting it ahead of time and going](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m52s)

[okay when you put the file uh access](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m54s)

[modifier on there what I'm going to do](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m57s)

[is I'm just going to munch the name](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h37m59s)

[and appropriately forward all references](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m02s)

[to it and make sure that they're all in](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m04s)

[the same file because the compiler is](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m06s)

[the only thing that knows about files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m07s)

[once once you get compiled into the IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m10s)

[there is there are no files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m12s)

[like your your symbol file your pdb has](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m14s)

[a reference to files](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m17s)

[but there there's no real concept to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m20s)

[file beyond that point and definitely](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m23s)

[not in the IL](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m24s)

[so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m26s)

[cool I think with that I'm gonna wrap up](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m27s)

[for the night thank you everyone for](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m30s)

[coming and hanging out hopefully people](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m32s)

[found that interesting](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m49s)

[um I found it interesting because I](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m51s)

[always I love digging through some of](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m53s)

[the the](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m54s)

[in-depth stuff uh from the.net comp site](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m55s)

[the key thing to do is their YouTube One](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h38m58s)

[and then if you go to](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m00s)

[comp 2022 playlist this is where you'll](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m07s)

[start to find a bunch of stuff related](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m10s)

[to individual sessions or you can get](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m12s)

[the the big long videos from like day](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m13s)

[so we'll see what kind of coolness comes](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m22s)

[comes that way so](https://youtu.be/vgt8KExBuoI?t=02h39m27s)
