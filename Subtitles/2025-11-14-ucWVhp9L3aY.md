[great speakers. It's two days. Um, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m29s)

[they've kind of split the content. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m31s)

[where the first day, uh, is it scratchy?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m33s)

[Thank you, Victor. Let me check and see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m38s)

[bunch of my stuff updated and rebooted](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m42s)

[and I'm worried that that is problematic](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h01m44s)

[Okay, back to what I was talking about.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m08s)

[Gitcon me speaking uh two-day event. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m10s)

[day one is going to be focused a little](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m14s)

[bit more on developer centric side of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m16s)

[the fence. Um and day two a little bit](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m19s)

[more on the the leadership side of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m22s)

[fence. So um I believe I'm day one. I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m24s)

[fairly confident. Uh shockingly I will](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m28s)

[be showing off a lot of flows on get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m30s)

[effectively making you as effective as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m36s)

[possible. Um, I've done a similar](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m38s)

[variation of the talk uh the last](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m40s)

[several years, but every year I always](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m42s)

[try to uh tailor it based upon all the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m44s)

[releases that have been over the last](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m47s)

[right? Sprinkle in a little bit of, you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m50s)

[know, those hidden features that people](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m52s)

[often forget, but then making sure to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m54s)

[highlight all of the new stuff and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m56s)

[there's a lot of new stuff. Shockingly,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h04m58s)

[a ton of it is around AI. Um, I mean,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m00s)

[you can pull open their release notes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m03s)

[So, if you have not signed up, free to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m04s)

[every year. I enjoy it. Grab a spot.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m09s)

[I'll see you there. Okay. Next, Net Conf](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m12s)

[uh or as I like to refer to it, Geek](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m16s)

[Christmas. Um this is effectively uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m19s)

[conference from Microsoft where they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m23s)

[release a whole bunch of stuff. So, uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m26s)

[as per usual, every November we get a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m28s)

[new version of .NET, new version of C.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m31s)

[This year, Visual Studio 2026 went G,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m34s)

[which is great. So, if you were uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m37s)

[watching me stream or you saw my video](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m39s)

[with Mads before on uh some of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m41s)

[Visual Studio features, it is now out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m44s)

[there. Grab it, update it. Um we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m46s)

[going to use some of the features that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m49s)

[come through here. There are a lot of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m51s)

[really good talks. I think the ones that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m53s)

[excited me the most uh were often in day](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m55s)

[one. I haven't gotten through all of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h05m59s)

[them. I was uh trying to catch the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m01s)

[stream live as much as I could, but then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m04s)

[I kept scrubbing around, so I I kept](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m05s)

[losing my spot. Um, but the the one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m07s)

[specifically on day one from Steven Ta](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m11s)

[where he goes over the performance](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m13s)

[improvements that um hang on, this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m16s)

[doesn't look right. In net 9, ignore](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m20s)

[that one. We want the ones in net 10. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m22s)

[grabbed the wrong link. Hang on again.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m25s)

[See, this is the problem with me opening](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m28s)

[and clicking around and prepping stuff](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m29s)

[ahead of time is I apparently spent all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m30s)

[this time prepping and prepped the wrong](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m32s)

[stuff. Um, but going through a lot of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m34s)

[the performance improvements innet. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m36s)

[one of the things that some people have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m39s)

[probably heard me joke about is innet](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m41s)

[you don't have performance problems. You](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m43s)

[have memory problems, memory problems,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m45s)

[and memory problems.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m46s)

[A lot of the performance things that you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m49s)

[will see shown off all cut come down to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m51s)

[reducing um pressure on the garbage](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m55s)

[collector because that is typically one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h06m57s)

[of the the biggest bottlenecks in your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m00s)

[application. And the nice part Steven](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m02s)

[goes into all of the details of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m05s)

[improvements, but for the most part all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m08s)

[you need to know is update to the latest](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m10s)

[stuff and you get this for free. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m12s)

[this is often why when you see people](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m15s)

[updating to the latest version of .NET,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m17s)

[they go, "Oh, look at all of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m19s)

[wonderful speed improvements I got."](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m20s)

[Well, yeah, it's all of this stuff kind](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m22s)

[of under the hood that you just get for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m24s)

[free when you update to it. So, short](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m25s)

[version, .NET 10 is faster than .NET 9,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m28s)

[and if you update to it, you will get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m30s)

[all of those performance improvements.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m32s)

[It's great. Um, but check out his talk](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m35s)

[uh day one. It is very much worthwhile.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m38s)

[Um, I am also somewhat biased](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m41s)

[my friend and colleague Ben, he got](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m45s)

[selected to be one of the presenters at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m49s)

[.NET Comp. Um, and he knocked it out of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m52s)

[the park. So, day one and day two were](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m56s)

[all presentations from from Microsoft](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h07m57s)

[folks about all of their stuff. Today,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m00s)

[day three was all around um community](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m03s)

[day. So, it was a lot of industry](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m06s)

[leaders, MVPs, otherwise presenting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m07s)

[stuff there. Um, and so it is uh up and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m10s)

[running. Uh, hey Jordan. Um, it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m14s)

[functional. I won't say done, but it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m19s)

[it is it is very much functional. My](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m22s)

[wife was in painting some shelves and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m25s)

[bookcases that we're putting in earlier](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m27s)

[today. Um, but I've got, you know,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m29s)

[walls, flooring, green screen. It's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m32s)

[great. Uh, so yes. Um, finished. It's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m34s)

[probably going to be now the long tail](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m38s)

[of getting all the little things, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m40s)

[yes. Anyway, uh so but Bentock was great](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m41s)

[and we're actually going to leverage](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m44s)

[some of the concepts from it in doing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m45s)

[updating stuff today because I thought](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m48s)

[it was great. So it was all around um a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m51s)

[tool that he built of taking test output](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m53s)

[from TRX files and generating a Visual](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m56s)

[Studio playlist file. If you've not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h08m58s)

[heard of those things, don't worry. He](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m00s)

[he talks through them in the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m02s)

[presentation. It's great. It's about 25](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m04s)

[minutes long. Well worth your 25](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m06s)

[didn't grab.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m21s)

[Forgot all all of this stuff on uh doing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m23s)

[slow? Boy, I probably should have just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m50s)

[rebooted and installed all the updates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m52s)

[I I was cranking through updates before](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m54s)

[this started. Well, uh if you are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m56s)

[interested, we're going to cover a a few](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h09m59s)

[things tonight, but there is a user](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m01s)

[group uh coming up uh December 2nd uh 5](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m04s)

[to 6:30 where we are going to be talking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m08s)

[what's new in net 10 um/14.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m11s)

[So if you are a net engineer building](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m15s)

[anything, this is for you. This will be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m18s)

[all of the cool things. I might sprinkle](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m21s)

[a little FS2026 in there as well. But](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m23s)

[this release, unlike last year that was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m27s)

[kind of a little lackluster, uh this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m29s)

[year th there's a lot of stuff. The this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m31s)

[was this was a good year for features](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m35s)

[and updates and cool things. So, we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m38s)

[going to we're going to take a look at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m41s)

[some of those. Um if you haven't done](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m42s)

[so, download Net 10. Uh or if you're on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m44s)

[VS2026, you probably already got it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m48s)

[bundled in. But 10.0100 0.100 is the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m49s)

[official release. Um, and I do want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m53s)

[point out, um, for people who are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m55s)

[unfamiliar with how Microsoft versions](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m57s)

[the SDK, um, your first number is your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h10m59s)

[major version. Expect this guy to rev](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m02s)

[every year, right? The the second one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m04s)

[here is the minor version rev. They've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m09s)

[revved this a handful of times, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m13s)

[oftentimes they don't. um think uh 71,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m15s)

[72, 73 that they did. Um the last](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m20s)

[several they've kind of because they've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m23s)

[been doing such a fast yearly cadence,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m24s)

[they haven't really put out minor point](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m26s)

[releases.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m28s)

[But then the this last 100 is actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m29s)

[two numbers squashed together. So you'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m33s)

[note that these are always three digits](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m35s)

[and this 100 you'll always see 100, 200,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m38s)

[300, 400 because they put that kind of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m41s)

[in the quarters of the year that these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m43s)

[things are coming out. And then the last](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m45s)

[two numbers, think of them as your build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m46s)

[ID or similar. So when you are looking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m48s)

[at these versions, just know that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m50s)

[assembly versioning only allows for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m53s)

[three digits or three sections of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m54s)

[numbers. And so they went, that's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m56s)

[We'll just scratch two numbers together](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h11m58s)

[in the last one. So that's how that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m00s)

[works in case you were wondering. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m02s)

[okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m04s)

[new stuff that is in C# 14. And we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m06s)

[going to go rev some projects to pick](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m08s)

[this up. But the the the key ones that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m11s)

[think for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m15s)

[that that excite me the most, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m17s)

[Like we got to call these ones out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m19s)

[Extension everything or extension](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m20s)

[members as they're calling it, right? We](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m23s)

[got extension methods uh way back in C.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m25s)

[Well, what was it? It was like net 35 or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m30s)

[three, I'm trying to remember. um when](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m34s)

[link was introduced, but it was just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m36s)

[methods and specifically instance](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m39s)

[methods, right? And and I say instance](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m42s)

[in quotes because even though the the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m43s)

[the extension methods were declared](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m45s)

[static, they showed up and appeared as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m47s)

[though they were instance methods. And I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m48s)

[think immediately everybody wanted, ooh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m51s)

[could we get extension properties? Could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m53s)

[we get extension insert wish list here?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m56s)

[Right? And so we now have extension](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h12m58s)

[members. And you'll note they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m01s)

[demonstrated here. They have extension](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m03s)

[operators on top of things. Static](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m06s)

[extension property. You can do static](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m09s)

[extension methods. So if there is a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m12s)

[static class um that you want to put a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m14s)

[uh maybe a factory method on um there is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m18s)

[now an option for that as well. You have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m22s)

[your your usual extension methods and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m25s)

[your extension properties. The other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m28s)

[thing that is really cool about this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m29s)

[this is down level supported. So what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m31s)

[that means is as long as you are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m34s)

[compiling](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m37s)

[with the um the latest version of C um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m38s)

[compiler. So you do need the the .NET 10](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m42s)

[SDK to compile this. You can still](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m45s)

[target an older version of .NET and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m47s)

[leverage this feature, right? Which is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m49s)

[really cool. Like it it is and that's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m52s)

[one of the blurry lines between .NET and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m54s)

[C is sometimes features require things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m56s)

[in the um in the base class library. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h13m59s)

[it's like, well, you can't really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m02s)

[downlevel that unless you polyfill or do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m04s)

[some things. This this one works](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m06s)

[backwards, which is pretty cool. Um, and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m09s)

[I don't remember exactly how far back it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m11s)

[works, but everything that's reasonably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m13s)

[modern, right? So, this is one of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m15s)

[the the big features in here. This is an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m18s)

[awesome one, right? I think I would go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m21s)

[as far as to say I would not write](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m24s)

[extension methods with the old syntax](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m27s)

[anymore ever. I don't know if I'm going](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m32s)

[to jump immediately to um to going and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m35s)

[changing them, but I think all net new](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m40s)

[extensions that I write are probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m42s)

[going to be in this syntax, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m44s)

[Unless I have some reason to think um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m47s)

[that I won't. Yes, Kenny. Well, we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m50s)

[touching on a handful of them. I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m52s)

[want to completely spoil the user group,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m54s)

[but I got to show off my favorite ones.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m55s)

[So, extension members are absolutely](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h14m57s)

[amazing. Um, I will point out that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m00s)

[because you get these fancy things like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m02s)

[extension operators,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m05s)

[this opens up a whole new world of of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m07s)

[incredibly watty insane code that you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m11s)

[can do. Like, this gets this gets a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m14s)

[little bit insane, right? However, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m17s)

[will point one key thing out that these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m20s)

[are still extension members. So, they're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m24s)

[still subject to the usual overload](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m27s)

[resolution that we had with extension](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m29s)

[methods before, right? So, if you had an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m32s)

[instance](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m36s)

[member that was called uh for example,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m37s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m41s)

[um the extension method would have lower](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m42s)

[um overload resolution priority than the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m47s)

[instance member. The instance member](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m49s)

[would always win, right? So there is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m51s)

[those types of situations where you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m54s)

[can't really use extension members to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h15m56s)

[hijack things, but you can use them to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m00s)

[extend things where they aren't there](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m03s)

[and then do some really wacky stuff with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m04s)

[it. Especi](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m06s)

[you you can just start having fun,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m10s)

[right? And write some completely](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m12s)

[unrealable C# which for some of us is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m13s)

[pretty epic. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m17s)

[Uh, let's see more partial members. Oh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m20s)

[I I think this one here was supposed to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m23s)

[be the null conditional assignment,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m25s)

[right? So, this is the other the other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m26s)

[big one that I think is going to change](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m28s)

[the way I write a lot of C is before we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m30s)

[had what some people call the Elvis](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m33s)

[operator. null propagation operator](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m35s)

[question mark dot, right? And it was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m37s)

[only usable on the gets, not the sets,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m40s)

[right? So you you had no way of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m45s)

[conditionally assigning to something.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m47s)

[You only had conditionally reading of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m50s)

[it. So the the null propagation operator](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m52s)

[was always on the right hand side of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m56s)

[equals, not on the left. Well, now we've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h16m58s)

[put it all the way onto the left. Right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m00s)

[And it's important to note that uh what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m03s)

[this ends up meaning right it means that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m06s)

[if customer is null this function is not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m09s)

[invoked](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m13s)

[right very similar to what you had up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m14s)

[here right these are logically the same](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m16s)

[that's important if this function has](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m20s)

[side effects right now in general you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m22s)

[should avoid that but if a function has](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m24s)

[side effects you do run into this issue](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m26s)

[so don't do that that would be add.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m29s)

[Um, but it does mean we can now write](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m34s)

[some much cleaner code. Um, it also](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m36s)

[means that you can leverage this for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m40s)

[like event registrations with your plus](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m42s)

[equals, minus equals, etc. Right? Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m44s)

[you don't get away with it for increment](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m47s)

[and decrement operators. Eh, boohoo.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m49s)

[Right? So, these ones are cool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m52s)

[These ones not as cool. But like I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h17m56s)

[know how I don't know how often I am](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m01s)

[doing plus+ on something that is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m03s)

[nullable](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m06s)

[ever, right? Um, so yeah, this it's a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m08s)

[very simplistic feature. Some people may](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m12s)

[not even notice the change in the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m15s)

[codebase because they're already](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m16s)

[familiar with the question mark dot.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m17s)

[It's just it's now on the left side of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m19s)

[the equals rather than the right which](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m21s)

[again completely changes the way I write](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m22s)

[code because I am taking these four](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m25s)

[lines making them one line everyone's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m28s)

[happy or at least I'm happy and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m30s)

[giggling. Um the last one and this one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m32s)

[is specifically](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m34s)

[uh very useful for um if you are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m36s)

[leveraging like the MVVM toolkit you're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m40s)

[writing a lot of properties or otherwise](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m43s)

[is before we we always had this idea of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m46s)

[we had to write a backing field and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m49s)

[often times there was like coding](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m51s)

[guidelines that would say hey you know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m54s)

[if you're wrapping the field up in a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m56s)

[property because you want to put](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m57s)

[validation or something on it like what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h18m58s)

[you have here um don't ever access the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m00s)

[field outside of the property and you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m03s)

[just kind of enforce that by convention](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m05s)

[rather than by rule.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m07s)

[However, with auto properties, the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m09s)

[compiler generates a field behind the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m11s)

[scenes for you. If you ever looked at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m13s)

[the IIL, you'll see this kind of funky](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m15s)

[named field that gets generated and that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m17s)

[and that's all the auto property is a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m19s)

[syntactic sugar around a field that the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m21s)

[compiler generates for you. Now we can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m24s)

[actually access](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m26s)

[uh that compiler generated field with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m29s)

[the field keyword. Now this is a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m32s)

[breaking change. Um specifically because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m34s)

[people might have fields on their](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m38s)

[classes that are named field, right? A](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m40s)

[lot of things leverage this because a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m45s)

[field is a thing. especially if you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m47s)

[built anything that was like um source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m48s)

[generated](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m52s)

[um database related like field is a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m53s)

[common enough word. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m56s)

[so if you do have this this is a bit of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h19m59s)

[a breaking change. There is a source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m03s)

[analyzer um to try to flag this if it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m05s)

[biting you. But you do then need to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m10s)

[disamiguate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m12s)

[uh with the at or or this field to to be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m14s)

[clear about which which way you are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m18s)

[trying to go right because field is now](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m21s)

[a contextual keyword for being inside a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m23s)

[property. So if you have any of those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m26s)

[things, those matter now, right? Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m28s)

[okay. Um there are a handful of breaking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m32s)

[level changes. Most of these things I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m36s)

[like I always enjoy reading the breaking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m38s)

[changes because it gives me ideas of bad](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m41s)

[things to do. Um but they're also](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m43s)

[they're it's very rare that these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m46s)

[actually bite me in the case of um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m48s)

[anything else. um the the scoped keyword](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m52s)

[inside of a a lambda parameter. So one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m56s)

[of the things if you watch um Steven's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h20m59s)

[talk from day one of net comp he talks](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m01s)

[about how they were able to gain a lot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m04s)

[of performance improvements via](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m07s)

[something called escape analysis. So the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m09s)

[idea is if you have a uh a parameter](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m11s)

[inside of a function, say you're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m14s)

[referencing some object, um they don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m16s)

[have to allocate memory on the heap for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m20s)

[that object if they know that it never](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m22s)

[leaves the function, right? If they know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m24s)

[it's just going to be inside that local](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m27s)

[scope, they can then uh stack allocate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m29s)

[it, which means no GC pressure, which](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m32s)

[means uh code goes faster, right? But it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m35s)

[all comes from this escape analysis that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m38s)

[they added in into .NET 10 to get this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m41s)

[in certain situations. Great. Fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m43s)

[To support some of what's happening um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m47s)

[with all of this stuff, there is a a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m51s)

[keyword called scoped that is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m54s)

[specifically there around uh leveraging](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h21m57s)

[uh if you do refr to to uh market for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m00s)

[the escape analysis. Right? Again, most](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m04s)

[people don't get into this level of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m06s)

[detail, but if you do, this will matter.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m08s)

[Um, and I think this is the one that's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m10s)

[most likely to break people is this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m12s)

[now always uh a modifier. And once](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m15s)

[again, you have to disambiguate with an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m19s)

[at if you've already got one. Again, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m21s)

[don't think people are going to run into](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m23s)

[this. And again, the other one is this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m25s)

[field on a property referring to a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m27s)

[backing field. I think these are the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m29s)

[ones that are most likely to break](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m31s)

[people. Um, and I think this one here is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m35s)

[uh these types of things. But again,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m43s)

[these are small warnings that if you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m44s)

[were doing this before, the fix is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m46s)

[pretty trivial, right? Don't don't do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m49s)

[this, right? O is not null or 42. Well,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m52s)

[okay, fine. Like that's that's not a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m55s)

[thing. Um, so it's like, well, yes, you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h22m57s)

[could have accidentally done this. It's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m00s)

[great that they're now flagging it,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m02s)

[especially if you have warnings as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m04s)

[errors turned on. This is now a uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m05s)

[compile breaking change for those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m08s)

[people. Um, but again, just a handful of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m10s)

[things worth uh looking at to see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m13s)

[Okay, there's all of at least that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m17s)

[would say is the highlights reel of C uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m22s)

[of the things that I think are the most](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m25s)

[important there. There's also lots of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m28s)

[cool stuff that's been announced for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m31s)

[Aspire Entity Framework, um the BCL.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m32s)

[We're not going to jump into all of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m37s)

[those right this second. Not right this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m38s)

[second. We've got we've got other things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m41s)

[to do. Uh okay, something else I want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m43s)

[highlight. So, I have been hard at work](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m46s)

[on the uh automarker library for people](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m49s)

[who tuned in two weeks ago. Um was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m52s)

[hacking away on the source generators.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m55s)

[Those are now in merged and there is a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h23m59s)

[release that has gone out the door. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m02s)

[um, I got my hands on the Nougat keys](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m05s)

[and all of the the needful and so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m09s)

[my versions](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m13s)

[where did my versions go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m15s)

[there. I'm I'm blind. So, you will see](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m21s)

[three days ago I kicked a release out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m23s)

[the door 360720.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m25s)

[So if you are somebody using uh mock](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m29s)

[automaker, please give it a try. Um I am](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m32s)

[this release here is probably going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m37s)

[be my 360 release. I've now put it in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m40s)

[three projects without issue. So that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m44s)

[gives me a lot of confidence that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m48s)

[haven't a broken anything because that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m50s)

[constitutes somewhere around like 10,000](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m53s)

[different tests. So it's like okay](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m55s)

[that's a reasonableish but I also tend](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h24m57s)

[to write my tests in a particular way.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m00s)

[So it's it's a lot of test in one style.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m02s)

[So it it would be good to get a few](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m06s)

[other people to verify things. But we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m08s)

[are now back in the situation where we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m11s)

[are rolling releases out because you can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m13s)

[see the last release was way too long](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m15s)

[ago. All right. We we don't do that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m18s)

[anymore. So now that I've got my hands](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m21s)

[on it, we are rolling releases. do check](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m23s)

[it out again. Let me know if there is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m25s)

[any problems that you run into because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m27s)

[would like to roll it get things going.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m31s)

[The other thing and I I need to put in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m33s)

[some documentation for this because this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m36s)

[has been one of the the biggest problems](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m37s)

[with it is I have secretly with this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m39s)

[release embedded things that are source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m43s)

[generatory e. Um, and so the the big](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m46s)

[idea here is if you bring in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m51s)

[mock.autoocker](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m54s)

[um into a project that is referencing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h25m56s)

[Microsoft extension options,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m00s)

[it will add this with options extension](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m03s)

[method. And I know I just finished](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m06s)

[saying that I would never write](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m07s)

[extension methods in the old syntax](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m08s)

[anymore. Well, in this case, because I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m10s)

[targeting other stuff, I don't know what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m13s)

[version of the compiler this code is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m16s)

[going to run against. So, I you'll note](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m18s)

[that the generated stuff I tend to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m20s)

[write, we'll call it older idiomatic C](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m22s)

[just to get broader compatibility. It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m25s)

[source this class into your project](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m27s)

[because I got annoyed having to write](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m32s)

[this extension method on Automacher on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m34s)

[multiple projects. So, I killed it. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m35s)

[there is a MS build property you can set](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m39s)

[if you want to turn off these source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m42s)

[generators. There's a similar one for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m43s)

[eyeloger as well where it embeds the the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m45s)

[Microsoft fake logger as an in-memory](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m48s)

[implementation to grab your logging](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m50s)

[messages. Again, it just looks for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m52s)

[projects that are referencing those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m54s)

[dependencies. It means that automacher](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m55s)

[itself doesn't need to take a dependency](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h26m58s)

[on those libraries](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m00s)

[and it can just source genom in when it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m02s)

[runs into them which is kind of a in my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m05s)

[opinion a very clever trick. It puts the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m08s)

[burden on me the library author to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m10s)

[handle all those cases whereas](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m13s)

[oftentimes what people do is they make](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m15s)

[derivative Nougat packages that bring in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m17s)

[those extra dependencies which is fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m19s)

[I just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m22s)

[I don't like a lot of the I don't like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m24s)

[having to deal with a a deep nougat](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m26s)

[hierarchy and this was my way around it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m29s)

[So, I'm experimenting with it. So, if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m31s)

[you like it and you think it's good,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m33s)

[great. Play around with them. Um I do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m34s)

[want to get some docs in place so that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m37s)

[people are clear on how this stuff works](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m39s)

[because I don't think that that is very](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m41s)

[discoverable. Magic extension methods](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m43s)

[lighting up are cool. Um, but nobody's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m45s)

[going to discover the MS build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m48s)

[properties unless they they actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m50s)

[come in and look at my source code. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m52s)

[for for what it's worth, I think that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m55s)

[that is worth doing. I will just point](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m57s)

[out if anybody's looking for what those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h27m59s)

[are, um, enable automarker options](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m01s)

[generator is this guy here. So, there's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m04s)

[your build property. Takes a bool,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m06s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m09s)

[Toggle the bool accordingly and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m11s)

[you're off to the races. So clever trick](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m13s)

[as a way of going through and adding](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m15s)

[stuff in. The rest of the source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m19s)

[generators still are in there for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m21s)

[generating like the constructor tests.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m22s)

[Um so if you're leveraging that to dodge](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m25s)

[people's poor restrictions around](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m28s)

[um code coverage metrics, they are in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m33s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m36s)

[Okay. Uh we got stuff. We got stuff. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m38s)

[there are a handful of things I was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m43s)

[hoping to go through and rev and get up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m46s)

[to date and rolling. Um, this guy here,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m49s)

[why is there a PR open? Oh, it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m53s)

[dependabot. And I haven't done this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m55s)

[Okay, so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h28m58s)

[we are going to we are going to leverage](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m00s)

[for icon for Nougat package. Huh, this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m05s)

[feels like something I co-pilot myself](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m08s)

[to victory on. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m10s)

[let's see. Update all dependencies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m13s)

[Uh, let's see. Update all nougat](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m18s)

[uh packages to their latest versions.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m23s)

[Resolve any build warnings or compiler](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m29s)

[errors.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m36s)

[And then we're just going to give it to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m38s)

[Copilot and say, "Go have fun." and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m39s)

[we'll see what it comes back with. Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m41s)

[yeah, do it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m43s)

[And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m47s)

[send it. Okay, so we'll get that one off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m49s)

[to the races and going. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m51s)

[this one here, what do we got blocking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m55s)

[us?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h29m59s)

[right. So, this is another source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m00s)

[generator problem one that we may punt](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m02s)

[on for the moment and then come back to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m05s)

[in a little bit because I do want to get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m06s)

[the ZAML test stuff updated. But I now](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m09s)

[that I've done a couple of the source](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m12s)

[generators in the the new way. It it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m14s)

[doesn't feel quite as bad, but it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m16s)

[slightly more uh arduous than I had](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m18s)

[initially thought. Um, okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m21s)

[material design. There was there was one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m24s)

[here that came in that caught my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m27s)

[attention and I was curious about. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m29s)

[there was an issue that was opened](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m31s)

[and I'm I'm mildly skeptical](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m36s)

[and I'll explain why here in a minute.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m44s)

[this one here, did the issue get closed?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m47s)

[Uh, where is the cuz it was flagged as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m51s)

[discussion](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m54s)

[labels or I guess question. I know it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h30m56s)

[was because I flagged it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m00s)

[So if I go there and look at closed](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m03s)

[boy did the whole thing get deleted](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m10s)

[that. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m12s)

[this one here, the the user here did](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m14s)

[open an issue asking about adding more](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m18s)

[comprehensive tests. Now there's this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m20s)

[looks very well written.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m24s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m27s)

[but it also looks very AI heavy and so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m30s)

[we are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m34s)

[we are like I am less familiar with this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m37s)

[git tensor](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m42s)

[one and it it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m44s)

[it is very interesting to me of what it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m47s)

[was tasked with like it's it's nice that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m51s)

[somebody has AIified doing work for open](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h31m53s)

[misunderstand the workload for an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m02s)

[the code.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m07s)

[It is managing the backlog, the PRs and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m09s)

[the code reviews. That is where the lion](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m13s)

[share of the work comes in. So on one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m16s)

[hand](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m19s)

[this is nice](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m21s)

[but I am but I am very skeptical of AI](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m23s)

[generated stuff because I don't need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m26s)

[something that's just going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m29s)

[Enigma project, uh, just as an update, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m52s)

[went and made made a new friend this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m55s)

[week with one of the engineers on the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h32m58s)

[pick his brain a little bit on thoughts.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m03s)

[Uh, who's updated yet? Oh, I did update.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m05s)

[Um, and we're going to So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m09s)

[uh, my templates project, my templates](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m14s)

[project has been revved. So, this guy is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m16s)

[updated to net 10,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m20s)

[uh, which is exciting. I did run into a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m23s)

[small issue where some of the hosted](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m26s)

[agents on GitHub were not updated when I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m30s)

[did this, but I think I waited like 30](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m33s)

[minutes after it was announced. So, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m35s)

[can kind of cut them a little slack for,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m38s)

[you know, not rolling out the latest SDK](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m39s)

[to every hosted agent in that period of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m42s)

[time. So, um, in my case, I got away](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m44s)

[with it here because I was the getting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m47s)

[the preview because I think I got RC2](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m50s)

[when I did the build, which was fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m52s)

[like my stuff didn't care. So, it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m54s)

[like, yeah, whatever. Good enough. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m56s)

[so, but my my templates are updated](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h33m58s)

[uh with all of that in place. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m02s)

[uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m09s)

[yeah. So, and I think we may end up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m14s)

[squashing some of these here. Um, the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m17s)

[other thing I was hoping to do is I was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m20s)

[hoping to actually steal Ben's tool that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m22s)

[he demoed. Um, because it's kind of a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m24s)

[slick thing. So, the idea being that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m27s)

[when a test fails, it would be really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m30s)

[cool to upload a build artifact of a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m32s)

[Visual Studio playlist file that shows](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m35s)

[you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m38s)

[uh that you can download that it just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m39s)

[includes the failing test, so it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m42s)

[easier to to get them going. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m43s)

[LOL. the second it was mentioned I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m46s)

[updated my apps but don't have CI/CD](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m47s)

[yet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I've I've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m50s)

[been pushing things to net 10](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m54s)

[preemptively and haven't really had any](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m56s)

[issue. Most of my apps it's just a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h34m58s)

[version toggle. Um and then occasionally](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m00s)

[a global JSON if you've got one of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m03s)

[those. Don't forget to rev it in those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m05s)

[places. And then obviously yeah CI/CD](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m06s)

[needs to be updated as well. Um, I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m10s)

[in a lot of cases if I've done my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m14s)

[pipelines correctly, I think I did this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m16s)

[on my templates. Should double check to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m19s)

[make sure I didn't botch this. Um, we'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m21s)

[pick on like the Nougat one. The](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m24s)

[uh because there's a global.json,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m28s)

[my setup.net should leverage the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m31s)

[global.json so that it revs with it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m34s)

[Yeah. So, this is in my opinion the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m38s)

[correct way to do it. just FYI. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m40s)

[that guy um so that when you want to rev](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m45s)

[your package uh or your your framework](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m50s)

[version, you rev it in your global.json](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m54s)

[and then you don't have to remember to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m56s)

[go and update it in all your pipelines,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m57s)

[right? Your global.json serves as that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h35m59s)

[centralized place of what build tooling](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m01s)

[do all of my things need, right? it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m04s)

[respected by your IDE the the terminal](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m07s)

[um that is one other thing I should show](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m11s)

[off um DNx](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m13s)

[uh so this is something that is int net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m16s)

[00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,640](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m19s)

and again we won't go through all of the

[stuff but DNx is worth is worth](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m24s)

[highlighting so um this I think came](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m26s)

[about from feature envy of other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m30s)

[languages and frameworks um that have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m32s)

[this ability to to effectively](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m35s)

[uh execute quick and easy, right? Think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m38s)

[of this DNx is the is tonet what npx is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m42s)

[to npm, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m48s)

[Is right, but close enough. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m51s)

[so it gives a a quick and easy way of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m54s)

[quickly evaluating and running tools.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h36m58s)

[And so it it's a nice](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m01s)

[simple way of being able to kick things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m04s)

[off. So hey,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m06s)

[sweet. We got we got caught up. Um it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m09s)

[only does exist because it is part of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m12s)

[the .NET 10 SDK. If you are not running](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m14s)

[the latest net 10, uh DNx uh will not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m17s)

[work for you. So just know you do need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m21s)

[the latest tooling to have, you know,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m23s)

[this thing for the the CLI. So but it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m26s)

[a nice little feature. I did see a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m29s)

[from his online handle um where he had](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m36s)

[used it as a way of basically a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m40s)

[putting a QR code where people could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m43s)

[grab stuff, it's like, "Hey, run this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m44s)

[DNx command. You get all the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m46s)

[information." Clever. Very nice. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m47s)

[quick and easy way uh to be able to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m51s)

[through and leverage things. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h37m54s)

[uh yeah so the the the npx is a way of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m00s)

[quickly executing a tool that is stored](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m04s)

[out in npm dnx is roughly the equivalent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m07s)

[to that fornet Izzy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m10s)

[um because oftentimes like most of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m13s)

[npx commands I've run recently have been](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m16s)

[npx commands to launch somebody's um mcp](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m19s)

[server that I wanted to use. That's I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m22s)

[will be honest that is most of my NPX](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m25s)

[invocations in like the last three or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m28s)

[four months is I want this MCP server.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m29s)

[Well, they released it as a tool out on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m33s)

[npm. Great type thing. Hit enter. It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m36s)

[pulls it down, runs the tool, everyone's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m39s)

[happy, right? It's just a kind of a a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m41s)

[loose wrapper around a lot of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m45s)

[convenience of acquire tool, run tool,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m47s)

[do the thing. Um because in just uh just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m49s)

[to point out like net say is a net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m54s)

[global tool that exists](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h38m58s)

[I think we can just go look at it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m01s)

[Yeah. So this is just a net global tool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m07s)

[And so when you do DNx like for their](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m11s)

[their sample here, right? When you do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m14s)

[DNx.net net say it's going out looking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m17s)

[for a global tool that matches and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m20s)

[invoking the tool with these arcs right](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m22s)

[so it's combining a net uh tool install](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m25s)

[a net run and of those things there](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m29s)

[um yeah that's actually a a a thing Izzy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m34s)

[I was contemplating going through and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m38s)

[doing a demonstration on I think I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m40s)

[actually have a reasonable use case for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m43s)

[an MCP server where I think I can put](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m45s)

[together](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m49s)

[better uses for interacting with the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m51s)

[material design library that even things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m55s)

[like context 7 won't do a great job of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h39m58s)

[because all of those rely on like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m01s)

[context 7 relies on effectively being](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m04s)

[able to parse the repository in the docs](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m06s)

[and doing kind of this rag based look](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m08s)

[lookup to to pull in information but I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m11s)

[think as the library author I can do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m13s)

[better of putting together very specific](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m16s)

[use cases so that when people are using](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m19s)

[things like cursor copilot or whatever](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m22s)

[if they've loaded in the my MCP of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m24s)

[how to actually generate the appropriate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m29s)

[um ZAML using the latest library stuff.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m32s)

[I think I can do better with this. Um, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m35s)

[also secretly kind of want to be able to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m39s)

[embed in migration docs, but that's uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m41s)

[that's a that's been a a pipe dream for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m46s)

[a while. But I I think I think MCP might](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m48s)

[be might be the magic sauce for that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m52s)

[Like me and another engineer a long time](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m55s)

[ago kind of dreamed up this system where](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h40m58s)

[library authors could put something in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m01s)

[their package or or or otherwise that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m04s)

[would give a tool enough information to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m07s)

[make the relevant changes to somebody's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m11s)

[repository to upgrade them from version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m12s)

[A to version B, right? And so you know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m14s)

[then there's the question of well what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m17s)

[do you have to do for the intermediate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m18s)

[versions? All that jazz. But often times](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m20s)

[when there's breaking changes as the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m22s)

[library author, we usually have a pretty](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m24s)

[good idea of what people should change](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m26s)

[to what, right? There's a handful of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m29s)

[times it's like, "Sorry, there's just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m31s)

[nothing here anymore." But sometimes](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m32s)

[it's like, "Yeah, that thing got](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m33s)

[renamed." And so, you know, people will](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m35s)

[put in like obsolete attributes. Hey,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m36s)

[don't use this anymore. It's this other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m38s)

[thing instead. It's like, well, shoot,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m40s)

[if I know the transformation, it'd be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m41s)

[really cool if I could do that. And so I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m44s)

[had this thought in my head that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m46s)

[MCP would be a real like an MCP server](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m50s)

[would be a really slick way to to be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m52s)

[able to prompt the AI agent because you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m56s)

[can put prompts inside of it and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h41m58s)

[also give it the um the idea of of what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m00s)

[those transformations need to be because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m04s)

[then the agent can do more intelligent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m06s)

[stuff. Uh could it be embedded into an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m08s)

[app? thinking Nigma app with the search](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m11s)

[chat feature to find info as there may](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m13s)

[be a lot in there when finished. Ooh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m15s)

[that is an interesting idea. Um, because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m17s)

[the whole So, I don't know if you would](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m20s)

[necessarily need an MCP, but putting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m23s)

[something in there that could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m26s)

[be that AI chat client certainly is an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m28s)

[option. Like a lot of the use cases for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m32s)

[MCP are being able to get more context](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m34s)

[into an agent o other than what it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m38s)

[currently got access to, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m40s)

[Sometimes it's to give the agent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m42s)

[capabilities like um Playright is a a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m44s)

[favorite example for a lot of people is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m47s)

[the Playright MCP lets the agent start a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m49s)

[browser, interact with the DOM, do some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m52s)

[clicky clicky, right? It it adds a lot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m54s)

[of cool functionality that the agent can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m57s)

[then just start doing stuff, right? But](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h42m59s)

[I think a lot of cases for people's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m01s)

[MCPs, it's the capability that they want](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m03s)

[to give the agent access to is some way](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m06s)

[to either get access or to manipulate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m08s)

[certain data or otherwise um that it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m11s)

[otherw it it wouldn't otherwise be able](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m14s)

[to get to right because the MCP server](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m16s)

[like you imagine an enterprise um it can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m19s)

[have the relevant off and things built](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m22s)

[in and and know about you know people's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m24s)

[particular structures and otherwise to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m26s)

[go out and get data and maybe the MCP](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m28s)

[shells out into another AI to do some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m31s)

[some logic if it needs to to kind of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m33s)

[like orchestrate this whole stuff. But](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m35s)

[often times it's hey, I need this bridge](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m37s)

[between what the AI is doing and what I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m41s)

[have access to. So yeah, it could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m44s)

[certainly be something with extra data](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m46s)

[that that we seed in to get to get some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m49s)

[more context in because that that could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m51s)

[be a very interesting thing to to play](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m54s)

[with as well because I' I've been](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m56s)

[wanting to go through and and do a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m57s)

[stream building and hosting one out. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h43m59s)

[there was some cool demos of building](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m03s)

[MCP servers in Net Comp that got me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m06s)

[thinking of I'm I'm noodling on ideas.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m08s)

[They they got me inspired to start](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m12s)

[thinking of I feel like there's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m14s)

[something there. I just need to figure](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m16s)

[out what I want.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m19s)

[Um that's the hardest part. Figuring](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m22s)

[once I know what I want, I'm confident I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m24s)

[can make it manifest. I just need to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m26s)

[figure out what what exactly it is I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m28s)

[want because I want this magical thing,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m30s)

[but I I want this magical thing isn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m32s)

[quite good enough, right? Um okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m35s)

[I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m38s)

[uh I'm gonna save this. This was a page](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m40s)

[I found on changing volume of individual](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m43s)

[apps. May come back to that. Um, you're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m45s)

[still chugging away, aren't you?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m48s)

[And we're going to see how this works. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m51s)

[don't know how well it's going to do.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m53s)

[Uh, mostly because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h44m57s)

[uh Oh, is it done? Oh, it's done.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m01s)

[Um.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m06s)

[Oh, and it revved the global tool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m09s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m13s)

[Okay. Well, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m18s)

[proof is in the pudding for this one of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m21s)

[let's promote to a real voice and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m25s)

[approve to run, I think, because I I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m28s)

[want to see it actually I want to see it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m31s)

[pass my pipeline. If it passes the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m34s)

[pipeline, it's probably going to be in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m35s)

[pretty good shape. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m37s)

[Oh, wow.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m44s)

[Okay. Um, let's see here. So, let's go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m46s)

[back into our poll request and we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m50s)

[going to prompt copilot one more time to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m51s)

[fix this. Uh, cuz I only told it nougat](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m53s)

[dependencies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m55s)

[Uh, we want to come down here. Let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m56s)

[see. At copilot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h45m59s)

[also update all of the GitHub](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m02s)

[actions as well.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m07s)

[Yeah, do that too. Pretty please. Okay,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m10s)

[we'll come back to you and check on you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m13s)

[in a minute. Um, okay. So, this chip](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m15s)

[test here. So, I'm I'm wanting to see](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m20s)

[Let's just grab this. Let's just grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m23s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m26s)

[So, give me give me one second here. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m27s)

[got to get my Kraken flipped over to the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m29s)

[right profile.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m31s)

[We go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m35s)

[Then we're going to go material design](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m37s)

[and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m40s)

[find all your stuff. do the needful](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m45s)

[figure it out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m47s)

[Uh, let's see. We'll get my main updated](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m49s)

[and then let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m53s)

[let's check this guy out and and take a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m56s)

[look at it. So, one of the things that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h46m59s)

[think is worth calling out for people is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m01s)

[you don't need libraries to update to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m06s)

[net 10 for you to update to net 10,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m08s)

[right? like the material design library.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m11s)

[I don't need to update to net 10 for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m13s)

[anybody wanting to leverage it. Me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m15s)

[updating to net 10 would be because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m18s)

[want um the extra stuff inside of my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m20s)

[library, but there's nothing about it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m24s)

[that makes it incompatible.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m26s)

[The one thing I do want to do, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m29s)

[see, Visual Studio has been updated.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m33s)

[Yay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m35s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m37s)

[This project couldn't be reloaded.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m39s)

[Okay, that was weird. Um, setup](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m43s)

[care.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m47s)

[Uh, let's see. We do want to get off of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m49s)

[306 into 307. Um, we are going to look](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m52s)

[at revving this. So, I'm going to get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m55s)

[the tooling updated to net 10. Um, and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h47m57s)

[we're going to look at new analyzers and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m00s)

[see what warnings and whatnot may come.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m02s)

[But there will be so I do not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m04s)

[immediately drop support for old](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m09s)

[versions ofnet. What I have often told](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m10s)

[people is I will only commit to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m13s)

[supporting something as long as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m15s)

[Microsoft is supporting it. So once it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m16s)

[hits end of life, I make no guarantees](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m18s)

[that I will support it. However, as long](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m21s)

[as the older versions ofnet aren't being](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m24s)

[painful to me, meaning I can still](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m27s)

[compile for them, SDKs, all that jazz,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m30s)

[great. I'm I probably don't kill off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m32s)

[support without a reason.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m35s)

[Once that changes, well, then we start](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m37s)

[killing things. And we start killing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m39s)

[things. Uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m41s)

[Okay, so we have this. Um I want to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m46s)

[look at the tests](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m51s)

[which are not there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m54s)

[I wish there was an easier way to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m57s)

[from PR review of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h48m59s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m03s)

[PR review into the relevant changes](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m07s)

[cuz let's see test the icon property cuz](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m11s)

[what is what exactly did this thing do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m14s)

[icon icon background is uh asking for a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m18s)

[friend let's see so you mean my app can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m22s)

[be can be 10 but MDX can stay at nine](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m25s)

[can one update MDX uh to the 10 version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m28s)

[before updating the app. Yes. So the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m31s)

[idea here is um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m34s)

[multi-targeting. So the way it works is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m39s)

[inside of my CSR I multi-target to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m42s)

[different frameworks when you pull in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m46s)

[the Nougat package um it means that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m49s)

[there are multiple copies of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m52s)

[material design uh DLS sitting in the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m54s)

[lib folder of the nougat package.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m56s)

[The Nougat restore then picks the one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h49m59s)

[picks the DLL from these that best](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m02s)

[matches your app. So if you go net 10,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m06s)

[you're going to end up picking up the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m09s)

[net 8 Windows version of mine. And for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m11s)

[example, you'll note I didn't have to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m13s)

[rev this to nine because there wasn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m15s)

[really a need to do so, right? like the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m18s)

[the other thing that's worth noting um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m22s)

[net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m25s)

[uh let's see 10 LTS](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m27s)

[what is the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m30s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m32s)

[there is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m36s)

[um let me sorry 10](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m39s)

[they they changed a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m46s)

[date on net 10 and I want to get the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m50s)

[I want to find the official docs on what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m54s)

[it is because before they had a this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h50m56s)

[will work well enough.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m01s)

[So this is the the support end date](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m04s)

[stuff for for what is in support. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m06s)

[you'll know net 8 stays in support um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m09s)

[all the way until November 10th of next](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m14s)

[year. So, I'm not planning on killing it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m16s)

[here, but you'll note Net 9 dies the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m19s)

[same day. So, that'll be that'll be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m22s)

[exciting. Um, and then Net 10 is out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m26s)

[till 2028. Off to the races.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m29s)

[And the what I was looking for is there](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m32s)

[was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m35s)

[Yeah. So, the long-term support patches](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m39s)

[for three years, standard term support](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m41s)

[patches for two years. So it does mean](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m43s)

[that you're going to run into this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m45s)

[situation where people who are unable to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m46s)

[update consistently uh because you know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m49s)

[updating your framework is a a major](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m52s)

[undertaking for one reason or another at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m54s)

[where you're at. The](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h51m58s)

[most of the time they're going to just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m01s)

[be doing the the LTS versions. They're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m02s)

[going to have three years, but you'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m05s)

[see here there's this overlap of a year](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m07s)

[in the middle to give you that kind of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m09s)

[scheduling window to go through and work](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m12s)

[because some people can't update do it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m13s)

[Didn't STS used to be 1.5 years? Yes. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m16s)

[don't remember if it was 1.5 years or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m19s)

[not, but Microsoft did just recently](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m21s)

[increase this duration because before it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m24s)

[was really short. I think it was one and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m28s)

[a half and two or something like that. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m30s)

[I don't remember the exact time frame,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m31s)

[so don't quote me on that. This is what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m34s)

[it is today.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m36s)

[So, it is worth calling out that you do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m41s)

[have some period of time. So, I'm not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m45s)

[going to kill anything. I will probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m47s)

[add um a net 10 target to the material](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m51s)

[design project.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m54s)

[um one just because then I have it um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m56s)

[and I'm not trying to like scramble at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h52m59s)

[all next year. But what will probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m01s)

[happen is I'll have a net 10 and a net 8](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m03s)

[both in the Nougat package and then at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m06s)

[some point the net 8 will just drop off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m09s)

[again. And I'm not going to kill like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m11s)

[November 11th, I'm not dropping not net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m12s)

[net 8 support. But as soon as like the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m14s)

[SDKs are no longer easily available on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m17s)

[the GitHub runners and that kind of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m19s)

[thing. It's like now now it's costing me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m20s)

[time to support this kick. Right. I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m23s)

[not going to I'm not going to spend time](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m26s)

[supporting something that Microsoft](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m28s)

[isn't going to support from. However,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m30s)

[I'm I'm going to point this out. uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m33s)

[hero devs.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m37s)

[I don't think I've talked too much about](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m39s)

[them for anybody interested. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m40s)

[so for anybody interested in if you are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m48s)

[on an older](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m52s)

[thingy of various natures, Hero Devs do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m54s)

[offer um what they call never-ending](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h53m58s)

[support, NES. I always chuckle because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m00s)

[always think of the old Nintendo system.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m03s)

[Um, but they do have support for a lot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m05s)

[of different frameworks, right? Net they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m09s)

[can't do old framework because that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m12s)

[stuff wasn't open sourced, but Net 6 is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m14s)

[open sourced. So, they can build this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m17s)

[Um, and you can see they've got a whole](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m20s)

[bunch of other languages and frameworks.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m22s)

[Next.js, Angular,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m24s)

[uh, Bootstrap, Vue, etc., etc., etc. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m26s)

[if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m29s)

[and I the way they put it to me at one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m31s)

[point which I really like is this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m33s)

[morphine for a problem not vitamins](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m35s)

[right the long-term solution for most](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m38s)

[people is you probably migrate your apps](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m40s)

[to a newer thing right but sometimes you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m43s)

[can't do that sometimes it's out of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m47s)

[support and sometimes there's critical](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m49s)

[security patches that you need in those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m50s)

[cases they can offer you a patched](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m52s)

[version of whatever you're already on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m56s)

[for a fraction of the cost of what it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h54m58s)

[would be to migrate. So, if that is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m00s)

[interesting to people, Hero Devs is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m03s)

[awesome. They're a pretty cool company.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m06s)

[They're I I've met a number of their](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m08s)

[employees and they're just a lot of fun.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m10s)

[So, if you see them at at a a conference](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m13s)

[or something, say hi. Like, they they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m15s)

[usually absolutely kill it. Their](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m18s)

[marketing team is top-notch.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m20s)

[Okay, so back to the question of do we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m24s)

[keep these chip tests because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m27s)

[the user asked if I would be interested](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m31s)

[in comprehensive tests for the library.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m33s)

[The question is is I'm not entirely sure](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m36s)

[that these tests add a value is is my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m38s)

[problem](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m41s)

[because these tests are effectively](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m45s)

[pinning tests and and this is one of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m47s)

[those areas where](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m50s)

[I like it's possible that there's a bug,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m52s)

[right? like it is not uncommon for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m56s)

[somebody when creating um a dependency](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h55m59s)

[property to like muck up the default](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m02s)

[value. The thing is it's kind of rare](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m04s)

[and it's rare that it gets past anything](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m10s)

[with my UI tests involved. And these are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m13s)

[literally just testing the dependency](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m17s)

[are you are not wrong Izzy. You are not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m35s)

[wrong at all. It's I just I don't know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m37s)

[like and validating that the assignment](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m42s)

[of the property work like I feel like it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m45s)

[takes me longer to read these tests than](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h56m48s)

[This is slightly more interesting to me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m02s)

[Wait a minute.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m09s)

[Uh, let's see. This creates a list,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m15s)

[registers the event handler,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m17s)

[grabs the visual child, clicks the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m20s)

[button, and verifies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m22s)

[It doesn't even click the button,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m26s)

[though.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m27s)

[It simulates it by raising the click](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m30s)

[event on the button. See, I this is not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m32s)

[a, let me phrase, this is not a bad](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m35s)

[test, but this probably should be a UI](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m38s)

[test if we cared.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m41s)

[when delete button clicked, command is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m48s)

[executed. Again, not a bad test, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m51s)

[something I would argue should be done](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m54s)

[because this is the other problem is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m56s)

[this ignores the templating of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h57m59s)

[command is not executed.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m07s)

[I'm trying to look at what this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m14s)

[like it's it's literally testing this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m20s)

[functionality here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m23s)

[Yeah. And this is where it's like I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m33s)

[don't think this is cuz you'll note it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m35s)

[had to call apply default style](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m38s)

[which I think is my own extension method](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m41s)

[if I remember right. Yeah because it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m43s)

[hunts out the right style for the given](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m44s)

[visibility is controlled by the style.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m50s)

[Yeah. See this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m52s)

[yeah I think we reject this. I think we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h58m55s)

[okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h59m10s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=00h59m14s)

[Looks good. Thanks. Yeah, I'm a I'm a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h01m39s)

[little hesitant that this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h01m41s)

[this gives me a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h01m45s)

[this is this is setting off spidey sense](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h01m51s)

[the WPF templates and styles](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h02m52s)

[rather](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m01s)

[I'm going to put this on the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m17s)

[also put it in the stale queue to have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m26s)

[Mouse over radio buttons visuals.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m42s)

[okay so that's there. Let me check. Um I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m45s)

[think the material design 3 has the same](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m50s)

[thing, doesn't it? Let me see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h03m52s)

[So let's see. So there is hover,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m00s)

[focused, and pressed.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m04s)

[Yes. And I think, let me duplicate this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m07s)

[because I think material design 3 does](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m10s)

[the exact same thing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m12s)

[I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m15s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m18s)

[hoping it would just drop me right](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m20s)

[there. Uh, let's see. Is it toggles? Is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m21s)

[that what it's called?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m24s)

[Switches. Switch.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m26s)

[two specs. And this guy should be Yep.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m30s)

[Yep. Yep. hovered. Hovered icon.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m36s)

[That's the color.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m41s)

[What I'm interested in is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m44s)

[show me show me the state.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m47s)

[There we go. There's the state. So hover](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m52s)

[is two.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m55s)

[So this is only true for the material](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h04m57s)

[design two but they do use the little](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m00s)

[hand icon for three. Okay, good, good,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m02s)

[good, good, good. Let's check the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m06s)

[change.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m08s)

[Okay, so cursor hand. I am curious. It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m11s)

[did show hand there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m15s)

[Yep. And this is the this is the right](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m17s)

[way to do it is doing it with a setter](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m19s)

[on the style. This way any app engineer](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m22s)

[who does not like the the hand cursor](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m25s)

[they can they can either make it drive](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m28s)

[style they can set it directly on the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m29s)

[control they can they can overwrite it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m31s)

[if they want. Um let's see here](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m32s)

[uh let's see ellipse](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m38s)

[render transform width heightd.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m44s)

[One thing that's getting me is I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m49s)

[seeing this hardcoded and I'm wondering](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m50s)

[if that's going to bite us,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m52s)

[but we'll see. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h05m56s)

[interaction hover opacity.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m01s)

[That's probably correct. I I might need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m05s)

[to check the usage of that of that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m07s)

[constant, but I think that that actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m10s)

[tracks. Okay, so this is this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m12s)

[hardcoded. That's That is pretty close.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m15s)

[That is pretty close. Let's check it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m19s)

[out. Let's check it out. Uh we're going](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m20s)

[to go here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m23s)

[Oh, I kind of want to keep the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m25s)

[global.json there for the moment. Let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m26s)

[take a look. And then we go here. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m29s)

[I'm just interested in launching it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m31s)

[because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m34s)

[uh what?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m37s)

[Unable to locate the .NET SDK. Oh, boo.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m40s)

[Okay. Okay. So, apparently I need to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m45s)

[install an updated SDK. We'll just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m47s)

[discard the global.json for now. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m50s)

[then we're going to then we're going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m53s)

[rev this sucker up. Um, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h06m54s)

[people like Nikolai and Corins who](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m00s)

[contribute significantly to the library](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m03s)

[and on the maintainers list, they get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m05s)

[priority for review of PRs.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m08s)

[You're one of the maintainers, you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m11s)

[should have priority. That just feels](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m13s)

[right.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m15s)

[Um, especially since I think Corins has](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m17s)

[more PRs merged into this library than](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m20s)

[anyone else this year. I'm fairly](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m23s)

[confident. I haven't run numbers yet,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m26s)

[but I should check. Uh, I don't know why](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m28s)

[I have a breakpoint there. Great. Send](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m30s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m32s)

[Okay. So, I want to look at the toggles.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m34s)

[Toggle. Toggle. Toggle.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m37s)

[And then down here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m40s)

[Okay. So the question is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m44s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m49s)

[is that the right size is the question.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h07m56s)

[Is that the right size? So I'm noticing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m00s)

[the halo here](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m02s)

[um on the hover, the outer edge of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m04s)

[halo basically extends all the way to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m07s)

[the edge of the switch. I think it was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m09s)

[slightly smaller in the spec.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m11s)

[Yeah, it's slightly less than that. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m17s)

[here we can see that the edge of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m20s)

[switch actually sticks out. So, I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m22s)

[the halo is a little big](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m23s)

[compared to the spec, but I don't know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m26s)

[that the spec actually calls out how big](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m28s)

[it's supposed to be.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m32s)

[20 there, 36 wide. So, I mean, that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m34s)

[gives us an idea of where it would be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m38s)

[because you figure if the entire width](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m41s)

[of this thing is 36, this thing is uh 20](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m43s)

[pixels in diameter, that means you're 10](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m47s)

[in there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m50s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m52s)

[I guess now I'm wondering does the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h08m57s)

[does the button overhang the track or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m01s)

[not? I don't remember.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m03s)

[Regardless, I think the halo needs to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m07s)

[shrink down a little bit to be more in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m10s)

[line with this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m14s)

[Right. And I'm going to just zoom in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m17s)

[here because this one I think is easier](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m18s)

[to see. So the edge of the halo](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m20s)

[basically should go to right about where](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m22s)

[the the rounded corner of the track](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m24s)

[stops. That's the target size. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m26s)

[we got that. We got that. Let's go to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m30s)

[uh actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m34s)

[this guy. Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m37s)

[toggle button.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m40s)

[Let's go here. Let's go themes and let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m43s)

[go toggle button.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m46s)

[Then we're going to go break everything.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m48s)

[Get me my halo. Get me my halo. And then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m53s)

[this guy here was 442.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h09m56s)

[Okay. So, let's dial this down to maybe](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m01s)

[20 and see what that looks like.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m04s)

[And then I think we can hit the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m08s)

[Oh, does it not have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m12s)

[I was thinking the hot reload was in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m16s)

[here. Oh, that's something I should have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m18s)

[mentioned. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m20s)

[what's new in WPF in net 10? WPF got an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m25s)

[update in net 10.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m29s)

[I know, shocking. We are in 2025 and WPF](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m32s)

[has a page, right? Uh, so one, lots of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m37s)

[performance improvements. So if you just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m42s)

[want your WPF app to run faster, rev to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m43s)

[that. That's cool. Fluent style changes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m46s)

[These are nice. Um, but if you're using](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m48s)

[the material design library, not overly](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m51s)

[relevant,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m53s)

[right? Clipboard changes, not a big](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m55s)

[deal. binary formatter was marked](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m57s)

[obsolete net 9. You probably shouldn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h10m59s)

[have been using it anyway. Um the really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m01s)

[the solution is JSON serializ or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m05s)

[otherwise if if that's what you're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m07s)

[you're trying to do. I don't know that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m09s)

[this was a real common thing because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m11s)

[most of the time when you're using the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m12s)

[clipboard, you're trying to put](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m14s)

[something on there that can be pasted](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m16s)

[elsewhere, right? Handful of minor bug](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m17s)

[fixes. Not a big deal. Cleaned up some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m20s)

[dead code. Great. Um, message box got an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m22s)

[API update, right? So now it's like this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m26s)

[looks cool, but I think this is actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m30s)

[just getting it on par with Windforms.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m32s)

[So that is that is cool. There was one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m35s)

[more around](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m38s)

[thought I thought there was one more](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m40s)

[around um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m42s)

[content controls. Am I am I making that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m45s)

[up?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m47s)

[did the release announcements.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m48s)

[Uh I thought there was one more in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m52s)

[the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h11m56s)

[where is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m02s)

[uh let's see Windows forms type editors.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m09s)

[I thought there was one may maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m13s)

[maybe I'm misremembering what I thought](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m15s)

[I read. I thought there was one around](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m16s)

[um content control.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m20s)

[Oh, this one here, the recognizes access](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m27s)

[key. Um this is a nice one. This is what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m29s)

[I was thinking of with the the content](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m33s)

[presenter. So, um, for people who](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m35s)

[leverage access keys, if you see me ever](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m38s)

[put like an underscore, um, in one of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m40s)

[the what looks like a text field, um, as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m43s)

[a way of doing it, for example, if you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m46s)

[watch these menus at the top, when I hit](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m48s)

[alt, you'll note it, you get the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m49s)

[underline up here. These are the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m52s)

[accessor keys, right? So, if I do altB,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m54s)

[it hits the build menu,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h12m57s)

[right? So, it's just a quick way of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m00s)

[being able to uh, access. Often menus](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m01s)

[and buttons are the common controls that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m04s)

[will have accessor keys but you could](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m07s)

[specify them other in other places. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m09s)

[there is that as well for what it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m12s)

[worth.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m14s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m16s)

[did we launch? I don't think we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m18s)

[relaunched. Okay, let's go back and try](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m19s)

[this again.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m22s)

[We just want to see this guy go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m26s)

[I I do want to check as well because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m29s)

[seeing that this is primary light,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m31s)

[it's probably okay given what this guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m35s)

[is doing. I just want to make sure. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m38s)

[don't think we have any toggles that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m40s)

[theme outside of this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m44s)

[but it'll be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m46s)

[Yeah, cuz those ones there. So, that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m50s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m53s)

[Um, I can probably go a couple bigger](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h13m58s)

[because that's not quite to the edge of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m01s)

[that of the edge of the track. So, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m04s)

[bump that up just a hair bigger.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m06s)

[So, we went from 25 down. Let's go to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m09s)

[22.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m11s)

[All I want to do is see see that halo go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m14s)

[right about to where the um the rounded](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m17s)

[edge of the track is.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m21s)

[Okay. And then we will have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m29s)

[And don't worry Z, I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m34s)

[release a new version of the library on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m35s)

[you just yet.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m37s)

[Let's see here. How's that?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m39s)

[That looks pretty close. That looks](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m43s)

[pretty close. Okay, I agree with that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m46s)

[We're just going to dial down the size](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m51s)

[just a little bit](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m52s)

[because I think that's a little closer](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m54s)

[in line. Um, actually I should probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h14m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m00s)

[I think uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m04s)

[this size is a bit closer to what the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m07s)

[spec shows. Great. So even though](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m12s)

[material design is a spec, there's a lot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m15s)

[of stuff in it that is left up to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m17s)

[interpretation and individual](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m19s)

[implementations of the library. um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m20s)

[things like that where](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m25s)

[even though this this library aims to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m28s)

[faithfully implement the material design](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m30s)

[spec as best we can but there is a level](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m33s)

[of interpretation.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m35s)

[Let's see. Enable automerge. Enable](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m37s)

[automerge. And I'll go put my review on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m39s)

[it. So we can do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m41s)

[There we go. Okay. So there's that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m46s)

[There's that. There's that. Okay. Do we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m48s)

[do we merge in the other one? I think we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m50s)

[might just merge the other one just to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m52s)

[make it go in.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m54s)

[Um, and it's this one here. Let that go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h15m56s)

[Okay. So, we're going to approve](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m04s)

[workflow and run. And then I think I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m05s)

[gonna let this one merge only because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m08s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m10s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m13s)

[I I think I want to to leverage some of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m15s)

[this library because this is these are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m17s)

[basically just projects making it in.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m20s)

[They aren't actually being leveraged](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m23s)

[outside of it yet. So we're going to let](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m25s)

[this guy we're going to let this guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m27s)

[come in. And while that's going, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m30s)

[go let's go do some net tenny stuff with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m33s)

[this. Okay. So step one um we need to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m36s)

[find out which version I put on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m40s)

[the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m45s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m47s)

[which version I got here. So let's go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m50s)

[net d- uh list SDKs. I think I got net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m53s)

[10. Yeah, good, good, good. So I believe](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h16m57s)

[latest version of Visual Studio 2026](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m00s)

[should get you the release build of net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m02s)

[10 as of this week. I think if you don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m05s)

[have it run net list SDKs just to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m08s)

[confirm right we got it that's great](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m11s)

[okay step one we are going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m14s)

[solution items global.json](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m16s)

[and we are going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m18s)

[10.0100](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m21s)

[is the new](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m23s)

[requirement for compiling this app.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m25s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m28s)

[So, all this has done is bump the tool](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m30s)

[chain](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m33s)

[to using the the Net 10 SDK. So, I now](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m34s)

[have access to all the new tools, which](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m38s)

[is cool. Right here, in a minute, we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m41s)

[going to go we're going to go bump some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m43s)

[other stuff.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m45s)

[Um, and see how it goes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m47s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m50s)

[Boy, my machine is really dragging](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m52s)

[tonight. And I don't know quite what is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m55s)

[hogging up everything.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h17m59s)

[All memory related.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m02s)

[All memory related. And it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m05s)

[one of my browsers.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m09s)

[Um uh let's see late comment here. If](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m11s)

[Halo was off on toggle, maybe slider uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m14s)

[suffered the same. Oh, that's a good](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m18s)

[question.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m20s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m22s)

[let's see. I recall Halo being cut off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m25s)

[on slider when I used it at one point.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m27s)

[That's what made me think of it. Yeah, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m29s)

[we may have fix We'll go check it here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m32s)

[Um, we uh cuz I just want to make sure I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m34s)

[can launch after revving my SDK. Um, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m37s)

[think slider got fixed because slider](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m41s)

[also has a and I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m43s)

[what it's called.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m46s)

[There's a popup for showing the value of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m48s)

[the slider. And there was a lot of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m50s)

[debate that we had back and forth about](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m51s)

[what the default should be.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m54s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h18m59s)

[yeah. So, the hover on that one is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m02s)

[there. So, I think slider's fine. It was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m04s)

[I I think we probably added it to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m08s)

[slider. Yeah, this little bit here,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m10s)

[right? Um I think we I think we added it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m13s)

[to slider and probably forgot toggle. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m16s)

[I think same problem only in reverse and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m19s)

[several months ago. Uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m23s)

[Oh, it's my GitHub tab that is chewing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m27s)

[most of my memory. Lovely.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m30s)

[Lovely.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m33s)

[So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m35s)

[we're going to just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m38s)

[cover some of these down. Let's see. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m41s)

[let's see. Did this one also fix the set](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m44s)

[environment?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m46s)

[Uh, more flexible minor version. Wait,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m47s)

[what did you do?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m51s)

[You jerk. You absolute jerk. I mean,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h19m58s)

[that's fine, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m01s)

[sometimes Copilot, I did not ask you to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m04s)

[do that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m06s)

[Okay, so it fixed those.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m07s)

[I don't think this is the right syntax,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m11s)

[but we'll see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m16s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m18s)

[okay. Did it. It probably needs my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m21s)

[permission to rerun.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m22s)

[Okay, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m27s)

[prove workflows to run.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m29s)

[We'll let that thing go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m32s)

[and we're off to the races. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m35s)

[that that gets me there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m37s)

[Okay. Did we launch? I thought I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m40s)

[launched. Oh, no. We did launch because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m41s)

[I went and looked at the slider. Duh.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m43s)

[Okay. So, we can compile and run with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m45s)

[net 10. Huzzah. That gets me somewhere.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m46s)

[Um I just want to make sure that my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m49s)

[um my build stuff is all doing the same](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m53s)

[checkout that I showed before. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h20m57s)

[see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m00s)

[So, it's under my build artifacts.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m03s)

[Ooh, it's not. Oh, I can't do it with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m06s)

[the use global.json because I have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m09s)

[specific needs to have multiple.net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m13s)

[versions. Oh, I'm an idiot. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m15s)

[we're going to just bring in 10.x](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m18s)

[because that is going to be there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m20s)

[I really, really, really, really, really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m23s)

[Why do I indent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m28s)

[two spaces? Hey, co-pilot, come here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m32s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m38s)

[create new thread.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m42s)

[Fix the indentation of this file to only](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m44s)

[be two spaces rather than four. There.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m50s)

[There's an easy task. Go figure it out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m55s)

[Um, okay. So, that'll get me to there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h21m58s)

[Let's go see about bringing in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m00s)

[Let's give us a net 10 target here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m05s)

[And we're going to just give ourselves](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m09s)

[one more version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m11s)

[that's going to go there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m16s)

[We're going to do this one. The test we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m19s)

[just I always just test on latest](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m22s)

[because the number of bugs that I've had](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m23s)

[where latest is insufficient is almost](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m27s)

[nil. So we do that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m30s)

[Let's see. And we're going to we'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m34s)

[multi-target here](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m36s)

[because there's been almost zero bugs](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m39s)

[that have been framework dependent.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m42s)

[And then we might go grab Benjamin's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m49s)

[tool as well just to just to have it in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m52s)

[our pipeline, which would be nice. Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m56s)

[let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h22m59s)

[Did you finish co-pilot?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m04s)

[Probably should have left you open where](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m08s)

[I could keep an eye on you.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m09s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m12s)

[let's see. What' you do?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m14s)

[Looks valid.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m18s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m21s)

[we'll know in a minute when we push and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m23s)

[it falls over. Okay, so that gets me to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m24s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m28s)

[Um, let's see here. I think I'm going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m30s)

[just multitarget all of these two cuz I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m33s)

[don't see a reason not to. Again, I I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m35s)

[think the probably around](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m38s)

[January 2027,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m42s)

[we might start looking at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m45s)

[the net 8 dropping or something, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m48s)

[well, we'll see. Okay, resource](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m50s)

[generation. This can just be net 10.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m53s)

[This one, frankly, could have been net n](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m56s)

[a while back.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h23m58s)

[Um, what's your problem here?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m00s)

[Unsupported utility material color](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m02s)

[utilities test. Huh?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m05s)

[Oh, target frame works.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m10s)

[Works.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m13s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Shut up. I know you're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m16s)

[unhappy. Get over yourself.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m17s)

[Uh, let's see. That's fine. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m22s)

[Okay. Do we compile with the new stuff?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m26s)

[I hope we do. And then I want to make](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m35s)

[sure I bump my lang version up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m38s)

[So, I usually am an advocate of manually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m41s)

[controlling your lang version. Some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m46s)

[people would argue that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m48s)

[the global.json is sufficient. Um, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m51s)

[don't fully like that, especially if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m55s)

[it's allowed to roll forward enough. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h24m57s)

[and some people like you can set](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m00s)

[language to things like latest or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m02s)

[preview. The only thing I don't like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m04s)

[about that is then I get different](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m06s)

[behavior on different machines. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m07s)

[build box might do something different.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m10s)

[Let's see. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m13s)

[uh, yeah, that is not there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m16s)

[Oh, and look at this. So we can start](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m23s)

[pruning package. Oh, I'm so happy now.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m24s)

[I'm so happy. Let's do a full rebuild. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m27s)

[think it just needs its OBJ directory](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m29s)

[torched.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m31s)

[Net 10 is here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m34s)

[Um, okay. So, let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m37s)

[Install dependencies. What did you fail](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m42s)

[on?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m45s)

[See, this is what I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m46s)

[um Oh, this is this is not the material](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m48s)

[design one. Uh, let's see. install](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m51s)

[dependencies. What did you what did you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m54s)

[squawk at?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h25m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m00s)

[so the install dependencies didn't work.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m02s)

[So we might have to go back and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m05s)

[figure out what is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m09s)

[problem there. Uh, let's let's just grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m13s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m17s)

[We're just going to We're just going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m18s)

[show me the ZAML.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m21s)

[Just going to grab this branch and go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m24s)

[pow-wow on it for a minute.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m26s)

[Uh we're going to let Copilot just kind](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m28s)

[of have its way with it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m30s)

[Give me Give me VS Code. We'll let we'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m37s)

[let VS Code and Copilot go to town](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m39s)

[there. Um let's see. Bring you over.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m48s)

[why does this thing have a console app](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m52s)

[one? Did I just Oh, I just probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m53s)

[accidentally left something around. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m56s)

[yeah. Squash. Don't care. Um, and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h26m59s)

[install dependencies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m04s)

[The version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m07s)

[That's what failed.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m16s)

[What the heck? Which which package did](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m20s)

[you not find?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m23s)

[Which package were you unable to locate?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m28s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m35s)

[yeah, sure. So, here's what we're going](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m37s)

[to do.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m38s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m40s)

[we're going to take you and I like my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m42s)

[sonnet 45 and we're going to say](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m44s)

[uh actually let's bring the pipeline in.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m54s)

[We are working on updating](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h27m59s)

[this projects dependencies](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m04s)

[and build pipeline.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m08s)

[Get it uh building and make any changes](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m12s)

[needed to dependencies and pipeline](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m17s)

[YAML. Okay, I'm going to let Copilot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m21s)

[think about that for a minute. And while](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m24s)

[it's thinking about its life and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m27s)

[considering everything that it's done.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m29s)

[Okay, I think we're launching.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m31s)

[I think we're launching. I think we have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m34s)

[a net 10 build. Huzzah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m37s)

[I'm very happy about this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m42s)

[Oh boy.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m44s)

[You want to slow your computer down?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m46s)

[Start running uh coding agents.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m48s)

[resources just gone.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m53s)

[Sorry, I've got my task manager open on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m56s)

[the other window and I'm just watching](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h28m58s)

[my my memory and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m00s)

[start chugging. Okay, so not shocking.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m05s)

[Uh, net 10 works just fine for us. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m09s)

[let's go back here. Back here. And we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m13s)

[are going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m17s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m35s)

[I've got too many of these. I I collect](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m37s)

[remotes a little too too much.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m40s)

[Um some point I just declare bankruptcy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m44s)

[and torch them all. Uh let's see what's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m47s)

[below O. Anything? Nope.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m50s)

[Okay, because we can we can get these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m53s)

[back as needed. It's two clicks. It's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h29m55s)

[two clicks.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m00s)

[Okay. So, let's go here and we're going](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m02s)

[to go uh net 10.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m06s)

[And let's just make sure that this thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m10s)

[compiles on the pipeline.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m13s)

[Uh, that's why my new laptop will have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m16s)

[198 gigs of RAM, 48 cores.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m20s)

[Oh my word. Four* 8 terb of NVME discs.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m24s)

[Oh yes, that is the dream. At some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m29s)

[point, I do need to rev this machine up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m31s)

[because I built this machine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m33s)

[When was it?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m37s)

[It was a few years before COVID. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m39s)

[might have been 2018](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m42s)

[maybe. Um, might be able to run a few](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m45s)

[agents then and a couple instances of VS](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m49s)

[Code.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m51s)

[Don't sell yourself short, Izzy. You got](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m53s)

[to be able to run at least two](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m55s)

[instances.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m56s)

[I will say there was a cool demo um that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h30m59s)

[got shown off on net comp on the launch](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m02s)

[speed of VS 2026.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m04s)

[Um, it felt a little apples and oranges](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m07s)

[to me, but they showed launching VS 2026](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m10s)

[um, and VS Code side by side um, with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m14s)

[almost identical launch times. Now, the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m19s)

[slight difference is that they were](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m23s)

[launching both into a clean empty state](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m25s)

[versus VS Code often is launching into](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m29s)

[the contents of a file or a directory.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m31s)

[And that's not really this like you do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m34s)

[that with Visual Studio, but it's not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m36s)

[really like the amount of time to being](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m38s)

[productive as you normally are in the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m41s)

[tool is a little different because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m43s)

[Visual Studio takes a few more clicks](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m44s)

[still whereas VS Code you're often like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m46s)

[there and going. So it's like yeah like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m48s)

[don't get me wrong the performance](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m52s)

[improvements are awesome and it is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m53s)

[exceptional that they are launching at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m56s)

[the same speed. It's just time to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h31m57s)

[productivity and time to launch aren't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m00s)

[always the same measurement.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m02s)

[Uh, let's see. Only going to cost me 6](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m04s)

[and a half thousand](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m06s)

[British pounds. Yeah. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m08s)

[See, my machine did not cost me my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m12s)

[machine cost me one fewer digit than](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m16s)

[what you have there when I initially](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m19s)

[built it cuz I paid in the hundreds, not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m22s)

[in the thousands for it. I will say it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m24s)

[been a night it's been a nice little](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m27s)

[machine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m29s)

[Okay. So, that's that's off and going.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m30s)

[And that will get us](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m34s)

[that'll get us rocking and rolling.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m37s)

[And if this guy passes, we're we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m41s)

[going to automerge. Um, and frankly, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m45s)

[think if we get past the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m48s)

[if we get past the build stage, we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m51s)

[probably in good shape because it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m54s)

[unlikely](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m56s)

[that net 10 is going to have any](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h32m58s)

[significant impact on any of the tests.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m00s)

[I don't think I think it's probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m04s)

[probably pretty simple. Okay. Well,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m07s)

[that's thinking about its life. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m09s)

[we wanted the show me the ZAML stuff.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m13s)

[Let's check in on what my good agent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m15s)

[friend is doing there. Oh man, I've got](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m19s)

[like four instances running. Let me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m21s)

[start shutting some of these down.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m24s)

[That'll probably give me Oh, look at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m25s)

[that. That gave me back some RAM. There](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m27s)

[we go. Okay. Uh let's see. So, what did](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m29s)

[you do? You were asking for permission](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m32s)

[to do what? Yeah, sensitive file](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m34s)

[editing. Sure. Great. Send it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m37s)

[Why are we even](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h33m46s)

[edit version and check the MS build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m18s)

[extras. Great. Okay, I need to just like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m20s)

[birthday. Also, happy birthday, Izzy,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m45s)

[cuz we are we are yoloing this. If I if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m50s)

[it works, we we send like the the proof](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m53s)

[is in the pudding. Okay, so that merged](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h36m57s)

[net 10 is coming shortly,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m03s)

[which will be good. Let's just make](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m07s)

[sure. Oh, we we did die a very very](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m08s)

[it does not have an accessible.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m22s)

[Okay, so we need to clean up some of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m25s)

[this stuff. So, let's move let's rebase](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m28s)

[our net 10 onto here. And then I guess I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m31s)

[probably should have checked the the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m35s)

[build output before I got too carried](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m36s)

[away. because that is one of the other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m38s)

[things that will bite you when you rev](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m40s)

[your net framework versions is you will](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m41s)

[pick up um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m44s)

[you'll pick up extra analyzers that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m49s)

[maybe previously weren't there and so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m51s)

[code that was fine is now getting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m54s)

[flagged. Well, it's not that your code](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m56s)

[is somehow](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m57s)

[like worse, but it's like it wasn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h37m59s)

[but we might be able to just clean this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m14s)

[up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m16s)

[So instead, I'm going to write a new](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m18s)

[library and a few laptops to use a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m19s)

[service](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m21s)

[uh without the pack step. The issues](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m23s)

[with the postpack target. Let me disable](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m25s)

[uh and pack explicitly.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m28s)

[Yeah, I'm curious what we were doing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m32s)

[with the post pack target.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m34s)

[Um, we should clean that up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m38s)

[Clean that up. So, what was it doing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m43s)

[with the package wrench?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m46s)

[Oh, it was changing the the dependency](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m50s)

[package version. I think this I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m53s)

[think is necessary anymore. I think we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m55s)

[can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m58s)

[I I think we can just do this with net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h39m59s)

[pack directly. This this was a issue](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m02s)

[like way back in the net core 3.1ish](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m04s)

[era. I don't think this level of hackery](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m07s)

[is necessary. We can probably just burn](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m11s)

[it to the ground. Okay. You happy now?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m14s)

[You did you do your thing? Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m18s)

[let's let's see what we got here. What](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m20s)

[what new exciting things has Net 10](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m22s)

[brought us? Let's see. Uh system text](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m24s)

[regular expressions will not be pruned.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m27s)

[Consider removing this from your package](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m29s)

[dependency. Great. Happy to remove](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m32s)

[That is great. Net http.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m38s)

[Uh effectively these were likely brought](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m42s)

[in to mitigate um minimum version things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m44s)

[out of place.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m53s)

[B comes before C.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h40m59s)

[All right. Which one are you? Were you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m03s)

[flagging?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m04s)

[HTTP. That one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m09s)

[Um let's see. Silly question. How well](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m12s)

[does WPF work with AOT? It doesn't. It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m15s)

[doesn't. Um, the there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m18s)

[things around the AOT stuff that WPF was](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m23s)

[never designed to handle, and I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m26s)

[know if it ever will. Um, often if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m29s)

[you're wanting AOT, you're better off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m33s)

[cutting over to something like Avalonia](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m36s)

[or Uno, um, or Maui, but I like my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m38s)

[Avalonian Uno better than that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m42s)

[um just as a way of of getting that. A](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m45s)

[lot of it comes because of its old](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m50s)

[reflectiony based stuff of and trying to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m52s)

[ahead of time compile that down. It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m56s)

[there's just a lot inside of the old](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h41m59s)

[tool chain that is not not ready for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m02s)

[AOT.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m05s)

[So that that is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m06s)

[is both good and bad about WPF because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m08s)

[it's got such a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m11s)

[well-built presentation core. Like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m14s)

[that's nice, but it is it also it like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m17s)

[it's stable, but it takes a lot to rev](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m22s)

[all the things. Um let's see. Why did it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m25s)

[flag this one?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m28s)

[Why is it still flagging these ones?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m31s)

[Oh, because I have both of these in](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m37s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m38s)

[Um, we don't need these in here anymore.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m40s)

[Let's see. WPF tests.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m44s)

[Those ones don't need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m47s)

[it in there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m51s)

[Yeah. Well, and the generics are one of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m54s)

[the big big ones for their dependency](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m57s)

[properties. of because generics were](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h42m59s)

[um being built at the same time WPF was.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m05s)

[So that it just it wasn't there for them](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m08s)

[to build on.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m10s)

[Okay. I think those are just dependent](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m12s)

[packages being flagged.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m14s)

[I think we got those. Oh no, I didn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m19s)

[get those two. Okay, fine. Compiler's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m21s)

[right. I'm wrong. Ah, okay. Finish your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m24s)

[building and then let's see. What are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m28s)

[you What are you yelling about? Copilot.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m29s)

[Uh, yeah, sure. Clean.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m31s)

[Oh, I probably should have added net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m34s)

[clean to the allowed thing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m36s)

[Again, there's a handful of commands](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m38s)

[that I'm I'm more comfortable letting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m40s)

[the AI run. There's only so much trouble](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m42s)

[it can get itself into running things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m44s)

[like net clean. It's like, yeah, sure,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m46s)

[it can do some badness. I guess here](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m49s)

[it's doing a clean and then a rebuild.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m52s)

[Uh, yeah, go ahead and monitor that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m54s)

[Look at that. Excellent. Everything is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h43m59s)

[working fine. Let me create a quick](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m02s)

[summary of changes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m03s)

[Great. I don't actually care. MS build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m05s)

[to path.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m08s)

[Those things don't matter. Oh man, it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m10s)

[was this stuff was using old MS build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m12s)

[net pack.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m16s)

[We didn't need the UNO stuff. Okay,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m19s)

[great. Okay, so that that gets me all to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m21s)

[there. That gets me all to there. Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m24s)

[Okay. So, we're gonna just don't let it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m27s)

[run git commit. Yeah, there's a handful](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m30s)

[I I think I've put on my allow list like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m33s)

[a get status or or get log or similar.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m35s)

[But yeah, there's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m38s)

[I like I'm not letting it run a git](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m41s)

[push. That sounds bad, right? Even git](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m44s)

[clean can be potentially scary if used](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m48s)

[in the wrong context. It's like maybe](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m52s)

[maybe we don't let it it should ask](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m55s)

[before it does those.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h44m58s)

[Um like I don't mind if it asks first.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m01s)

[Okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m05s)

[let's see. Compile working. Great. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m08s)

[So we got that much going. Thank you,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m12s)

[co-pilot. Um let's see here. Where did](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m14s)

[we end on the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m17s)

[Where did you end on the pack problem?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m20s)

[Okay. Generate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m26s)

[disable generate package on build now](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m28s)

[using explicit pack step.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h45m31s)

[Yeah, go figure yourself out. Okay. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h46m43s)

[why are you still flagging this?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h46m49s)

[something fun for work andor fun for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m12s)

[you? Let's see what are we doing. MS](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m15s)

[build package has no dependency as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m17s)

[expected. It's a build tool. The Avalon](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m19s)

[edit correctly depends. So, let me check](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m21s)

[that. Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m24s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m26s)

[Perfect. Now, let's run a final test.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m30s)

[Make sure everything still works.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m32s)

[Did it remove the global tool? It](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m35s)

[doesn't look like it has. Oh, it did.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m37s)

[Okay, good.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m40s)

[Great. That is more like what we wanted.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m43s)

[Thank you, co-pilot. You've been a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m47s)

[wonderful help. Now, go away. Let me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m49s)

[have my fun. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m51s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m54s)

[Uh let's see here. We're going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h50m57s)

[move nougat package wrench. Okay, there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m00s)

[Something of that nature.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m06s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m10s)

[does this Nougat package have I think it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m12s)

[has a a package icon, but let me just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m14s)

[check. If it doesn't, I'm going to let](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m17s)

[Copilot do something.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m19s)

[I have one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m24s)

[Oh, you got to spell correctly. Like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m27s)

[it's my own package. I know it's there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m29s)

[No package icon.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m32s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m34s)

[okay. Uh, thanks. Generate uh me a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m38s)

[nougat package icon.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m43s)

[make it uh relevant to ZAML and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m46s)

[viewing the XML. Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m53s)

[Go Cop-ilot go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h51m58s)

[Let me create an SVG icon and convert it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m04s)

[to PNG.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m06s)

[Interesting way of doing it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m08s)

[Okay, so that is cleaned up there and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m11s)

[that got all of those build things done.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m14s)

[Now I am curious why](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m17s)

[this thing built after I did that. But](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m21s)

[then this one failed with an inex.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m24s)

[I wonder if this build is lying to me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m32s)

[because the warnings Oh, probably](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m35s)

[because I have warnings as errors on the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m38s)

[pipeline and so the base projects failed](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m41s)

[to compile so it didn't get to the top](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m44s)

[ones. I bet you that's the issue. I bet](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m46s)

[you that's the issue. Okay, so let's go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m49s)

[back here. Back here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m51s)

[Here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m54s)

[Hey, Kraken, generate me a commit](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m57s)

[message.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h52m59s)

[Uh let's see. Bit of both. uh mainly](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m02s)

[work but looking at having uh Raspberry](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m05s)

[Pi and Enigma to do the runtime config](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m08s)

[of the rotors and key mapping also uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m10s)

[add the ability to run encodings of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m14s)

[files. Uh plus the app you're doing can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m16s)

[go on there too. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m19s)

[I will say that is um I I was just in uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m22s)

[given an extra Raspberry Pi from a uh a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m27s)

[buddy who](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m30s)

[didn't know what it was and didn't care,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m32s)

[which worked out great for me. Um but I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m35s)

[want to like load up like a little](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m39s)

[Raspian thing or something. I I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m41s)

[know what I'm going to use it for yet.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m43s)

[It may end up just being a pie hole or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m45s)

[something, but I need something.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m46s)

[Let's see. Uh, thinking of putting a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m50s)

[screen on inside of the lid so it also](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m52s)

[has a computer. Of course. Of course.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m54s)

[Because you can't make it too easy. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h53m58s)

[okay. The next thing while that guy's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m00s)

[chugging, we'll check over here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m02s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m13s)

[I mean, we're going to allow, but I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m14s)

[going to pause you.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m17s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m19s)

[I like that icon. The details are very](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m23s)

[small.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m29s)

[Let's come up with something a bit more](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m32s)

[minimalistic](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m36s)

[there. Do something different. Think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m38s)

[about think about what you've done.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m41s)

[Okay. While you are busy thinking about](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m42s)

[what you've done, we are going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m44s)

[over here to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m47s)

[Okay, so there is a fancy new thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m50s)

[called SLNX for people who saw it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m53s)

[before. Um, I held off upgrading some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m55s)

[stuff to it because there is a handful](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h54m58s)

[of things that aren't fully supported on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m00s)

[the tooling, but I don't believe any of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m02s)

[them exist here. Uh,net,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m04s)

[what is it? SLN. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m08s)

[there we go. So, net sln migrate. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m14s)

[generate an SLNX from an SLN file.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m17s)

[That's what we want. SLN](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m20s)

[migrate. This is how hard it is. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m23s)

[So, now we're going to close this down](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m26s)

[and then we're going to go test it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m29s)

[Actually, I guess what we can do is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m31s)

[this. So, we can just go explorer and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m32s)

[then feed it a period for the current](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m36s)

[directory. Launch. And now you'll see](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m37s)

[we've got we've got both side by side,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m41s)

[an SLNX and an SLN. And as long as the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m43s)

[SLN launches and does everything for me,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m47s)

[I just want to validate its conversion.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m49s)

[The the big advantage here is the SLNX.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m52s)

[And actually, maybe what I'll do is I'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m57s)

[open up both of these in VS Code just so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h55m58s)

[we can do them kind of side by side. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m01s)

[show more options.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m09s)

[Where's my VS Code?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m12s)

[Grumble. Gumble. Grumble. Gumble.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m15s)

[Gumble. Gumble. Gumble. Gumble.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m16s)

[Uh, what?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m21s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m24s)

[code launch.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m26s)

[There we go. That's all I want is I just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m29s)

[want this. Okay. Collapse.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m30s)

[Okay. So, here is the difference between](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m33s)

[so SLN. This is the old format. This is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m36s)

[what people have had. And you know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m38s)

[there's gooids and ugliness all over the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m40s)

[place. And then there's SLNX.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m42s)

[Pretty wonderful, calm, nice. Um this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m47s)

[this is effectively the solution version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m53s)

[of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m56s)

[uh project file change that we got a few](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h56m58s)

[years ago several years ago now where we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m00s)

[got the uh project SDK.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m03s)

[So, for example, if we look at any of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m08s)

[the CS projects, you know, these used to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m10s)

[be big and ugly, too. Um, and now they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m12s)

[are nicer and clean and and warm and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m15s)

[fuzzy. And now our solution files can be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m18s)

[the same way. So, there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m20s)

[things here. Just bringing in the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m23s)

[relevant files, project dependencies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m24s)

[Some of the stuff we can probably clean](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m26s)

[up and get out, but at least now](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m27s)

[solution files don't have to be complete](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m29s)

[garbage when it comes to like merge](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m32s)

[conflicts, which is why I merged that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m34s)

[other project first because I didn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m37s)

[want to deal with it. So, uh, let's see](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m38s)

[here. What do you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m41s)

[That looks better.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m44s)

[Uh, yeah,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m48s)

[perfect. I've created a minimalist icon,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m51s)

[right? We can keep this. Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m54s)

[let's see. Uh let's see. See how it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h57m57s)

[looks. Or you need converted.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m00s)

[Yes, please set it up to be used as the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m02s)

[Nougat package icon.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m09s)

[Do it. Copilot. I'm very close to being](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m13s)

[productive. Or at least you're being](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m15s)

[productive. Okay. So, there's that. The](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m18s)

[one thing I want to do here is I want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m20s)

[come into my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m22s)

[build stuff because in here I think all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m25s)

[I have to do is change this to an X. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m29s)

[think because I'm fairly confident all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m32s)

[of my stuff is set up to look at that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m37s)

[I don't know that I have anything else](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m42s)

[pointed at SLN.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m43s)

[Here's the answer is no. I just want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m49s)

[I'm going to check it over here real](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m51s)

[quick because I don't fully trust](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m53s)

[um this one. Let's see. Copilot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h58m57s)

[instructions the Yeah, see this is why I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m00s)

[didn't trust it. Uh let's see. SLN.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m03s)

[Okay. Stop helping me co-pilot. You're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m08s)

[you're make you are actively making my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m11s)

[life harder. I'm just going to put I'm](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m13s)

[going to put it in and I don't want you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m16s)

[to do it. Uh let's see here. And then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m17s)

[this one here is the only other one that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m21s)

[has it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m23s)

[Dang that. Stop.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m24s)

[And let me just type. Okay,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m27s)

[that doesn't matter.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m32s)

[Okay, so that should be fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m34s)

[a little surprised we didn't have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m39s)

[anything in a readme or similar, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m42s)

[that's okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m45s)

[Okay. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m48s)

[let's check and see out on our build. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m51s)

[think we pushed before upgrading to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m54s)

[SLNX. I just wanted to see if that run](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m56s)

[actually succeeded](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=01h59m59s)

[getting past that or not.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m01s)

[Uh, nope. We didn't push anything. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m05s)

[we're gonna We did push something.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m07s)

[Removes redundant package version.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m11s)

[Huh.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m22s)

[Interesting. Uh, let's see. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m25s)

[also blow away the SLN file. That's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h00m28s)

[set the thing,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h03m29s)

[co-pilot.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h04m22s)

[This is the watch you like a hawk](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h04m59s)

[moment. Let's just Let's just go look at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m01s)

[what you did because I trust you, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m04s)

[not that much. Okay, so we have a PNG](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m07s)

[that looks pretty good. It looks like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m12s)

[kind of what I would expect.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m14s)

[We've got a none include icon, a package](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m17s)

[icon. Everything's set there. That looks](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m20s)

[like what I would expect, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m22s)

[That looks like what I would expect](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m25s)

[there. I do want to Well, maybe not.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m27s)

[We'll leave it as it sits for now.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m30s)

[Great, great, great. That seems fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m33s)

[What is this?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m35s)

[Oh, because it bundles in as the tool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m42s)

[Okay, great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m43s)

[um stage. Sure.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m45s)

[Despite its checking, it appears to have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m50s)

[done the right thing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m52s)

[I don't don't fully trust it, but you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m54s)

[know,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m57s)

[we're going to we're going to build a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m58s)

[package. And given that I am literally](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h05m59s)

[the consumer of this package, I I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m02s)

[we'll be okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m04s)

[Uh okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m06s)

[uh there we are. We are off to the races](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m10s)

[and running. Okay. What did you fail on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m12s)

[Okay, we are getting these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m23s)

[we are getting them slightly awkward](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m30s)

[why.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m36s)

[So, when in doubt, always look at the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m40s)

[first one. Theme assist theme trigger](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m41s)

[have an accessible setter.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m45s)

[I understand what that's saying. I do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m50s)

[not understand](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m53s)

[why.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h06m55s)

[Why it thinks that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m06s)

[So yes, Trigger Brush is an internal](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m10s)

[member.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m16s)

[is there a a breaking? Okay, let's do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m26s)

[this. WPF GitHub.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m30s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m34s)

[let's just let's just briefly gander](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m37s)

[over here. Is there a bug?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m39s)

[[Laughter]](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m46s)

[Oh, look at that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h07m54s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m07s)

[Well, there's a fun one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m14s)

[And it's basically going to screw over](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m19s)

[library authors.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m21s)

[excellent.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m29s)

[lovely.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m40s)

[Yeah, WPFUI is getting hosed by the same](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m43s)

[well the good news is it's not my fault.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m54s)

[The bad news is it no workie.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h08m57s)

[That is very very very](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m02s)

[disappointing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m07s)

[Okay. Well, step one, we're subscribing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m08s)

[to this issue.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m11s)

[Excellent. You know how I was commenting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m16s)

[earlier about how stable WPF is? Let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m18s)

[just see. I want to read this person's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m21s)

[description because they're referencing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m22s)

[the MS build targets which means they've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m24s)

[probably debugged this a bit. Note that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m26s)

[both are internal. If both or even just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m29s)

[the set method are changed to public,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m31s)

[the bug disappears. And of course, we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m33s)

[can and we'll do that in the code base.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m36s)

[Um I don't know that I can well I can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m41s)

[sure but will that's debatable. The](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m45s)

[problem is that we have a large codebase](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m48s)

[with many branches and blah blah blah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m49s)

[This is somewhat complicated and I have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m51s)

[not experienced similar regressions when](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m53s)

[building in the past with newer SDKs.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h09m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m11s)

[how does it work? I can try to reduce](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m13s)

[this if need be.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m15s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m18s)

[yeah,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m23s)

[I have a strange suspicion. I know](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m25s)

[exactly what happened.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m27s)

[I have a suspicion.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m36s)

[I have a theory. Let's go a splunking.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m42s)

[This is one of the fun issues when you](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m46s)

[have a lot of things. Oh, there's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m48s)

[there's the announcement change.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m50s)

[There you go. Izzy or anybody looking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m53s)

[for the the the support? Uh is supported](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h10m56s)

[for three years.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m00s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m03s)

[So, this was November 11th. I think this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m05s)

[is what I remember seeing. No, maybe](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m08s)

[not. I there was a blog post about the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m11s)

[change of the the LTS version. Um, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m13s)

[believe](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m18s)

[there was Oh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m26s)

[I thought there was something around the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m31s)

[the access modifiers and that's what I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m38s)

[was going to blame.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m41s)

[but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m44s)

[does not appear that that is the case.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m49s)

[So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m51s)

[on one end, we're going to keep this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m53s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m54s)

[and we're going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h11m56s)

[uh time to check get blame and find out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m01s)

[why that got broken. Yeah, I I do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m05s)

[suspect](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m08s)

[I'm surprised I'm seeing these build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m13s)

[errors here and not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m16s)

[on my local.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m20s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m25s)

[so some of these are worth fixing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m28s)

[Uh, oh wait, these this isn't mine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m32s)

[Okay, that explains why I didn't see](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m34s)

[them locally.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m36s)

[Uh, let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m38s)

[Okay, so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m42s)

[we're going to grab this guy here. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m46s)

[don't remember what my build retention](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m48s)

[is set to, but hopefully long enough.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m50s)

[See also](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h12m54s)

[uh material design in ZAML project.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m01s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m08s)

[is a blocker for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m10s)

[as this is a library](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m17s)

[an app. Changing these to public](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m20s)

[is not really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m26s)

[an option. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m29s)

[I could probably work around it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m40s)

[I'm just thinking if the combination is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m45s)

[net 8 targeting](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m47s)

[from the net 10 SDK,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m50s)

[the I could probably work around it by](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m55s)

[only compiling net 8 from the net 8 SDK](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h13m58s)

[and then only compiling net 10 from the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m02s)

[net 10 SDK. Yuck. I could probably hack](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m04s)

[that around.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m08s)

[I don't want to do that though. That is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m10s)

[That is And there's nothing that says I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m12s)

[need to go to net 10 right now either](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m15s)

[beyond me wanting it. I want it. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m18s)

[there we go. Um, okay. So, this guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m20s)

[built and ran.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m23s)

[Let's go here and let's just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m26s)

[Okay. So, now it built and ran. We'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m29s)

[promote you to a real boy. And then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m32s)

[let's let's go look over the changes](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m34s)

[just to make sure I didn't do anything](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m38s)

[too crazy. So, we cleaned up the tool](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m39s)

[that we expect. Good. Rev the package](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m41s)

[version. The environment variable](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m45s)

[change.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m47s)

[I'm going to assume is correct, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m50s)

[we're going to double check it. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m52s)

[let's see here. Net build.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m55s)

[That guy there is leveraging the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h14m59s)

[solution. Fine. Fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m01s)

[We can let that slide. We may go rev him](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m04s)

[uh in a minute. Um, let's see. Net 8.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m08s)

[And honestly, I don't think this guy has](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m13s)

[any internals. Generate package on build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m15s)

[is set to false.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m18s)

[That's fine. I don't I don't see a major](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m21s)

[issue here. That's fine. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m24s)

[Yeah, we don't need the build extras](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m32s)

[anymore because we were doing all kind](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m34s)

[like when this project was initially](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m36s)

[done, I had to jump through some hoops](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m38s)

[to make the MS build packaging stuff](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m41s)

[work right and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m43s)

[shockingly they have made things a lot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m46s)

[better since um what is this?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m48s)

[Oh, this is needing the WPF ones.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m53s)

[Um it dropped](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h15m57s)

[net standard](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m01s)

[and UWP. That's probably okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m03s)

[For my purposes, I don't care.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m08s)

[Let me just double check what my demo](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m12s)

[app is targeting because I I need this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m15s)

[472 and net 8. Okay, so I as long as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m17s)

[I've got those, we're good because this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m20s)

[is a library that is largely built for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m23s)

[me by me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m26s)

[So, you know,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m28s)

[um, global.json. I don't think we even](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m30s)

[need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m34s)

[I think we can change this global JSON](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m36s)

[to just match.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m38s)

[I think we're going to just change it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m40s)

[Um, because there's no real reason to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m42s)

[make this thing different.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m45s)

[We're going to do here, here, and then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m47s)

[let's go up to the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m49s)

[um setup.net.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m52s)

[Uh, let's see here. And why is it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h16m55s)

[why is it using that package version?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m01s)

[I must be pushing up to GitHub](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m07s)

[artifacts. I don't remember why. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m09s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m12s)

[Use](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m14s)

[no intellisense. I don't I must not get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m16s)

[it. What is the what is the magical](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m18s)

[incantation here? Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m21s)

[oh. I can't do it here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m25s)

[Right. So, I can't steal from this one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m29s)

[But I can go and steal from my other](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m31s)

[library.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m34s)

[Here,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m37s)

[we want that as my width at version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m40s)

[five.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m43s)

[We come back here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m46s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m49s)

[don't need this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m54s)

[Can delete that. Can delete that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h17m57s)

[Uh, let's see. Available expression](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m05s)

[context. I think you're just lying to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m08s)

[me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m09s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m13s)

[Context access might be invalid. I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m15s)

[you also are lying to me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m18s)

[And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m22s)

[I think what we just saw is checkout is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m24s)

[V5](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m26s)

[and thennet](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m28s)

[is V5. Great. Okay, we're going to take](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m31s)

[this. Take this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m34s)

[I am going to grab a quick dependabot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m37s)

[config](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m41s)

[because I would like to get that added.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m43s)

[Take that. Push that. And then let's go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m46s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m50s)

[Let's go grab from my templates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m52s)

[I've got a reasonable dependabot one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m56s)

[that I like.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h18m58s)

[I did make a recent change to this for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m02s)

[anybody interested. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m04s)

[get my big head out of the way. Um, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m08s)

[now have it grouping up all of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m10s)

[GitHub actions in one shot rather than](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m11s)

[splitting them out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m13s)

[Um, I was somewhat tempted to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m15s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m21s)

[to group the Nougat package ones, but I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m23s)

[wasn't entirely](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m26s)

[I didn't know a good way to handle it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m28s)

[So, like on one hand, it's like, well, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m31s)

[want it to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m34s)

[to group, but I I couldn't find a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m36s)

[globbing pattern that I liked, at least](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m40s)

[at the template level. So there's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m42s)

[probably one on a per project basis that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m44s)

[would make sense. Let's see. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m47s)

[dependabot goes at the GitHub folder.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m49s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m52s)

[I needed to go here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m54s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m57s)

[why you no open uh explorer.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h19m59s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m05s)

[And then I'm going to put you into the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m07s)

[GitHub folder. Paste.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m09s)

[There we go. And now I have a dependabot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m12s)

[thing in here. We're going to get rid of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m15s)

[those.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m17s)

[And then we're going to do that. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m19s)

[then I want to grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m21s)

[my automerge](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m23s)

[thingy mabobber.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m26s)

[Uh we're going to get rid of the build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m28s)

[uno because the UNO guys, they they took](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m30s)

[my repo and they did their own thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m32s)

[with it, which is fine. Like that's what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m33s)

[they should do. But I did.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m35s)

[They didn't want to take a dependency on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m39s)

[me, which makes sense. And I need the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m41s)

[task down here for autocomplete.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m45s)

[Uh, where is my autocomplete?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m50s)

[There we go. I want you.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m54s)

[You are a real boy now.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h20m58s)

[Come back over here. Come back in here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m01s)

[right](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m05s)

[there. We turn on automerge.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m08s)

[Get that guy to rock and roll. And then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m11s)

[I just need to make sure that I have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m14s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m18s)

[I need to make sure that I turn on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m23s)

[autocomplete bits.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m26s)

[Yeah. Refresh. I need autocomplete bits](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m29s)

[for the repo which are probably off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m32s)

[because I don't think they existed. Like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m34s)

[wiki do did I even put anything in this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m38s)

[wiki? No. Turn the wiki off too. Wiki](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m40s)

[doesn't need to exist.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m44s)

[Uh actually this is not a bad idea.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m47s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m50s)

[I think I can just grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m53s)

[one from my one of those sponsor ones](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m56s)

[from my one of my other ones cuz we'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h21m59s)

[put that in. Okay. Allow merge commits.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m00s)

[No. Squash merging. Rebase merging.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m03s)

[Allow automerge. That's the key checkbox](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m06s)

[I was looking for cuz that's what](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m08s)

[enables the coolness. Okay. And then we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m10s)

[will have all of that. Let me go grab](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m14s)

[one of my sponsor ones from one of my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m18s)

[other repos because I think I've got a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m19s)

[reasonable one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m23s)

[Oh, and nose plug is here. I should get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m25s)

[rid of nose plug. That one doesn't need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m26s)

[to exist. Um I think ZAML test has a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m28s)

[sponsor thing on it, does it not?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m32s)

[Boy, I really need to get better at](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m36s)

[doing this. Okay, this one has one, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m38s)

[it has Adam on here, too. So, we just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m40s)

[want to get rid of that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m44s)

[Where is the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m47s)

[the sponsor file underneath GitHub](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m50s)

[funding yl? That's what I'm after. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m55s)

[want one of these. I want one of these.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h22m57s)

[Download.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m01s)

[Thank you. And we're going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m02s)

[cut that. And we're going to come over](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m06s)

[here and we're going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m08s)

[and then we're going to edit it. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m11s)

[it's just me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m13s)

[Sorry, Adam. You don't get to exist.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m15s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m18s)

[there we go. So, that goes like that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m20s)

[That goes like that. That goes like](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m22s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m25s)

[I want to check the base version should](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m27s)

[probably get revved to at least a minor](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m29s)

[version.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m32s)

[Uh, show me the ZAML.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m33s)

[Uh cuz we've already put out a version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m39s)

[two. Let's bump the version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m43s)

[to 21.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m47s)

[Get that guy up and going.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m49s)

[Like we don't have any major changes,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m52s)

[but we are changing our](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m53s)

[um base framework version. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m56s)

[there's all of that. That's all of that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h23m59s)

[See, where did we where did you get to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m03s)

[on your build? Uh let's see. I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m04s)

[think I need any of that. Let's go here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m08s)

[Here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m11s)

[Uh, let's see. Here. Pull requests.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m13s)

[You failed on a build.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m18s)

[SDK resolver could not resolve SDK build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m32s)

[Yeah, we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m39s)

[killed all those. Did we miss some? Look](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m42s)

[at that. We missed one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m45s)

[That'll do it. Okay, so we want to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m47s)

[change you up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m53s)

[Uh let's see here. I think we can just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h24m57s)

[grab the the regular build SDK. I don't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m00s)

[think there's anything fancy that we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m03s)

[need to be doing any in here anymore](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m05s)

[cuz we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m11s)

[base SDK should be perfectly fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m14s)

[I wonder if we even need this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m22s)

[I don't even think we do.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m25s)

[Uh, there's probably a lot more that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m29s)

[could clean up in here, but let's not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m30s)

[get too carried away. Uh, net build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m32s)

[is the use WPF flag in the newer project](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m46s)

[SD SDK should handle most of it, which](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m49s)

[it did. Which it did. Not shocking.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m52s)

[Let's see here. Uh, we don't need you.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h25m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m00s)

[oh, did that other one actually have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m09s)

[something in it?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m10s)

[I don't think it did.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m14s)

[Show me the Zaml generator tests.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m19s)

[Wonder why you still exist.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m22s)

[That's probably an accidental include.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m27s)

[Get rid of YouTube.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m30s)

[Um, okay. So, let's let's just send all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m34s)

[that up on top of it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m37s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m41s)

[yeah, sure. Add add in all the things.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m43s)

[Then at some point, I will SDK project](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m47s)

[this guy as well.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m49s)

[I will say this. I have so many projects](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m52s)

[set up with this dependabot. I it the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m54s)

[one annoying thing is the lack of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h26m58s)

[granularity on GitHub notifications and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m01s)

[I really need to find how to turn them](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m04s)

[off for dependabot because I just get](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m05s)

[utterly spammed.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m08s)

[It's always nice though have you seen](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m11s)

[everything come in and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m13s)

[fire off.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m16s)

[Okay, unexpected inputs include](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m18s)

[pre-release.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m23s)

[Oh, so include pre-release is no longer](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m25s)

[valid.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m27s)

[Got it. So, we should get rid of that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m31s)

[That makes me suspect that I've got a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m34s)

[bug in my template as well.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m36s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m39s)

[let's go check that real quick because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m43s)

[think we leeched that straight over from](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m46s)

[here. We did.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m48s)

[and that is no longer a thing. So, let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m51s)

[grab my templates repo and we are we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m56s)

[just going to keep rocking and rolling.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h27m59s)

[Uh, let's see here. Uh, don't need that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m01s)

[Don't need that. I need this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m06s)

[And then give me the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m10s)

[me VS Code again.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m13s)

[Just gonna uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m16s)

[Find them.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m20s)

[Oh, is it really only that one instance?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m22s)

[Wow.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m24s)

[Okay. Well, that's that's disappointing.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m26s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m30s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m37s)

[tempted to roll an update of this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m40s)

[so that my templates have a new version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m46s)

[pushed out there. Let me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m48s)

[let's look. We We I probably should](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m51s)

[probably should look at pushing an](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m55s)

[update.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h28m58s)

[Let's do that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m04s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m08s)

[don't know why. Uh don't save](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m14s)

[Apparently, I had outstanding co-pilot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m20s)

[commands that I never included, but I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m22s)

[don't want to bump them.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m25s)

[So, I believe just revving the version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m30s)

[there sends it out the door. Let me just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m32s)

[double check that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m35s)

[So, this thing has my my templates have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m37s)

[one of the coolest testing matrixes out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m41s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m43s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m45s)

[yeah, skip duplicate. So, new version](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m50s)

[there, revs it and sends it out the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m52s)

[door. So, this is actually going to go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m53s)

[live assuming it passes. So, this is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m55s)

[actually kind of cool. We'll show this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m57s)

[off real quick because I'm kind of proud](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h29m58s)

[of this. Like, I absolutely love my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m00s)

[templates repository because it makes me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m03s)

[feel like an utter mad scientist when](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m06s)

[this thing kicks off. As you'll know, it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m08s)

[it compiles, right? And that's that's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m11s)

[not a big deal because it's a templates](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m13s)

[repository. It's building up a net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m14s)

[template nougat package.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m16s)

[But once it builds the package, I go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m19s)

[through and test all of my templates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m21s)

[And I don't quite test them in the way](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m23s)

[that they recommend. They've got a a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m25s)

[little bit of a testing SDK that's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m29s)

[almost snapshotty testingish,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m31s)

[which is good. Um, but it doesn't give](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m34s)

[me as much confidence as I want.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m39s)

[Specifically, I I prefer to actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m42s)

[like fire it up, run net build, run net](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m44s)

[test, do the needful, right?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m46s)

[So, my tests are a little bit less about](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m51s)

[did it gen the exact code I expect and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m53s)

[does the template work because I would](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m55s)

[rather the template work](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m57s)

[um rather than spending time fussing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h30m59s)

[with it. But once it gets through the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m01s)

[the build stage and it gets into this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m05s)

[testing stage, you'll know these are all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m08s)

[matrix matrices and it just goes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m10s)

[It's very cool. Makes me excited. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m14s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m19s)

[okay. So, the good news is that thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m22s)

[worked](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m26s)

[aside from the little bit that we had to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m28s)

[turn off. Let's look at the show me the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m30s)

[ZAML. Did I push that change? Nope. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m32s)

[let's push that change. And that should](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m36s)

[make everything go away. And then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m40s)

[should be able to build a new package](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m43s)

[release of this guy,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m45s)

[which is cool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m48s)

[Get that one going.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m51s)

[Update. Yeah, this Tell me this isn't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m54s)

[like Look at all of those tests going.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h31m57s)

[It makes me so happy. I get so happy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m00s)

[things that make you feel powerful](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m04s)

[running](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m06s)

[lots of little minions running tests on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m07s)

[you. So the little the matrix on or the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m10s)

[matrix build on this each of the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m14s)

[packages um tests most common](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m16s)

[combinations of switches on there](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m21s)

[because I have um switches for picking](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m23s)

[different test frameworks, switches for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m26s)

[SLN versus SLNX.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m29s)

[Um and so it it just validates that all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m32s)

[of those things gen properly and that I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m35s)

[see at least a minimum number of things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m38s)

[out there. And this has caught me a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m41s)

[handful of times on accidentally making](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m44s)

[breaking stuff. So, it's pretty cool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m46s)

[The Avalonian ones will take the longest](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m48s)

[for like um the window or the I think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m50s)

[it's the Mac builds that are the slowest](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m55s)

[ones. Can't remember. Um, but because](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h32m57s)

[these ones have extra workloads that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m00s)

[they require, they they generally take a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m02s)

[little longer to run than than some of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m04s)

[my others because, you know, iOS and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m06s)

[Maui workloads and whatnot have to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m10s)

[install, which is it's one of those I've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m12s)

[I've contemplated breaking this one from](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m15s)

[a matrix and just testing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m16s)

[the uh um testing the builds](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m20s)

[individually rather than in separate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m24s)

[jobs because each job has to install the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m25s)

[workload, which kind of annoying and I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m28s)

[might be able to make them go faster by](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m30s)

[doing a single job testing the switches](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m34s)

[serally one at a time. Um because then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m37s)

[the the workload install would only need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m42s)

[to be done once rather than a bunch of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m44s)

[times in parallel. Nah, it's better for](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m46s)

[compute time.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m50s)

[Whatever. It's not an overly long build](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m52s)

[regardless. So, new version of templates](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m54s)

[coming out. Um, okay. So, back over to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h33m57s)

[here on show me the ZAML. This guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m00s)

[should have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m03s)

[a new thing already built, rocked and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m05s)

[rolled. We push the latest change. Yep.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m08s)

[Great. Um, let's see. Did we validate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m12s)

[all this stuff?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m15s)

[Those all looked good. That looks good.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m18s)

[That looks like what we would expect.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m22s)

[dependabot. We just added sponsor we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m24s)

[just did. We changed that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m27s)

[You've been very helpful.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m38s)

[Okay. So, we'll just modernize these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m41s)

[packages.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m42s)

[I will say the the AI being able to do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m45s)

[some of this boilerplate stuff has been](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m48s)

[kind of nice.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m50s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m51s)

[okay. So, that should go through and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m53s)

[fire. And then we are probably about to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m56s)

[get dependabot things kicking off left](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h34m58s)

[and right. And I think that's okay. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m01s)

[wanted to look really quick. What was my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m04s)

[release trigger for this library?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m05s)

[Because I've gone through so many.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m09s)

[This is the templates. Wrong one.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m12s)

[Uh, let's see this one. What is my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m15s)

[on push.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m21s)

[Probably a tag.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m24s)

[I bet you I probably set it up on a tag.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m26s)

[Yeah. So, it's going to want me to push](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m30s)

[a tag.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m33s)

[So, if it's not a pull request, it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m36s)

[pushes to nougat.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m38s)

[Oh, but it has the the skip skip dupes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m44s)

[Got it. So it'll always push to Nougat](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m49s)

[skipping dupes. The difference will be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m53s)

[um on the tag it will leverage the tag](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h35m56s)

[version to pull through. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m00s)

[Okay, that seems fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m02s)

[Okay. And this should hopefully catch up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m13s)

[on all of its stuff. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m16s)

[I said we're going to see some](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m20s)

[dependabot things coming through](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m21s)

[somewhat rapidly on each of these, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m24s)

[that's okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m27s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m30s)

[did this thing really build that fast?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m34s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m37s)

[I don't have a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m40s)

[branch restriction. That's what's that's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m42s)

[why it was able to build so fast. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m45s)

[yeah, we want a branch rule set here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m49s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h36m52s)

[force push, I'm going to force push. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h37m26s)

[though I guess I could just put myself](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h37m28s)

[on the bypass list. Um, where is the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h37m30s)

[probably needed to.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h38m43s)

[There. Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h38m46s)

[Okay, that will](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h38m51s)

[that will enforce a handful of these](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h38m54s)

[things. We are just going to close this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h38m56s)

[PR because it is not worth it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m00s)

[and not deal with it anymore. Dependabot](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m03s)

[will update itself as it sees fit and as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m05s)

[there are new versions. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m07s)

[let's see here. We will go through and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m11s)

[do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m14s)

[uh one more update I think. Well, we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m18s)

[might not need to. We've got it all set.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m22s)

[So, let's cut a tag.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m27s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m30s)

[manually rev all of my Nougat packages.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m42s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m48s)

[upgrade here, too.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m54s)

[That'd probably be okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m56s)

[Well, we will test it. Let's see. Let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h39m59s)

[do manage nougat packages.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h40m01s)

[this solution file in favor of](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h45m51s)

[Oh man, I don't know if I can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h45m58s)

[cuz this is way back. Like you'll note I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m01s)

[named this WPF core. That's how old this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m03s)

[is.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m05s)

[Yeah, we may we may the some of those](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m10s)

[examples may be just time to die.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m12s)

[Uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m16s)

[Great. Warning goes away. Keep. Let's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m19s)

[check our pipeline](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m22s)

[packages props. Good. Examples.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m26s)

[Um, I mean this we're going to not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m31s)

[I don't even](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m37s)

[we may not modernize these. These are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m40s)

[these are at a point where they can't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m44s)

[even compile. Um, let's see. Avalon](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m46s)

[edit.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m49s)

[Uh, that's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m51s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h46m59s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m02s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m04s)

[Okay. So, we're going to take that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m06s)

[and we're going to push that and that'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m12s)

[get a bunch of stuff cleaned up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m15s)

[And then PR that guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m20s)

[and it should](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m23s)

[just work.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m25s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m32s)

[There you go. Okay. So, that goes out](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m34s)

[there. That goes out there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m36s)

[Yeah. Thank you, Copilot. You've been a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m40s)

[wonderful audience. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m41s)

[okay. Close you down](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m46s)

[there. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m52s)

[what did you fail on? I'm curious why](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h47m56s)

[automerge failed](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m00s)

[build main. Oh, it is unhappy because I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m05s)

[didn't make it wait.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m10s)

[I need to have this thing depend on](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m13s)

[this is fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m23s)

[because it should use.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m31s)

[Okay, let me go look. I I I think this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m36s)

[is the setup. Um, but I probably just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m38s)

[haven't configured](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m41s)

[the automerge properly and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m44s)

[remember. I thought just checking the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m46s)

[box and making sure you had appropriate](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m48s)

[requests on there. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m51s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h48m56s)

[Oh, I think I need this. Use GitHub](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m01s)

[automerge. I think this is what I need.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m04s)

[I think that's what I want.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m14s)

[I think that's what I need. Um, which](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m22s)

[means I probably have yet another bug to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m25s)

[go fix in my templates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m27s)

[Let's put that in.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m30s)

[Keep finding these despite not working](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m34s)

[on the templates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m37s)

[Keep finding minor minor little things](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m40s)

[to tweak.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m42s)

[Um, let's go check.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m44s)

[Let me just check those over](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m48s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m51s)

[Let me just verify that I do have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h49m56s)

[Oh, my templates do have it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m00s)

[Which one did I copy from then?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m04s)

[Huh? Maybe I just missed it. Okay, well,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m07s)

[it's set up the way I would expect.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m11s)

[That's what's important.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m13s)

[And let's see here. So, we go back](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m15s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m19s)

[This one went two minutes ago. That's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m21s)

[probably fine. That passed. That passed.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m24s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m29s)

[squash merge. Squash merge.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m32s)

[Okay. And then that should trigger](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m37s)

[Dependabot to realize that it's not okay](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m39s)

[for it to do anything.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m43s)

[And it shouldn't need to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m48s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m53s)

[these ones are should now both fall off](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m54s)

[because they are no longer relevant and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h50m57s)

[Dependabot can close them. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m00s)

[dependabot. Yeah. Go ahead and rebase](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m03s)

[your PR. Realize you don't need to do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m06s)

[anything anymore and then Yeah. So it'll](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m08s)

[figure itself out and close it out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m11s)

[Okay. Good.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m13s)

[Good, good, good, good, good. Okay,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m15s)

[now for the show me the ZAML publish, we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m19s)

[just need to kick a tag out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m24s)

[I think we modernized everything. I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m28s)

[wanted to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m30s)

[uh delete origin.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m33s)

[I thought I had delete head branches](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m35s)

[turned on. Did I not do that? Typically,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m37s)

[when you merge your PRs, you want your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m40s)

[um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m47s)

[Oh, automatically delete head branches.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m49s)

[Apparently, I did not turn it on. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m51s)

[always suggest updating pull request](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m54s)

[branches.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h51m56s)

[Yeah, we probably should do that. It's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m00s)

[nice to have the button. Um, okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m02s)

[let's go back here and then what are the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m07s)

[remote tags? V2.0. So we're going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m10s)

[create a tag.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m13s)

[Create tag here. V2.1.0.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m15s)

[Submit. And then we are going to push](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m21s)

[the tag. And that should trigger a run](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m23s)

[that then deploys out to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m30s)

[Here](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m33s)

[we go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m36s)

[There's those. But this one is the one](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m40s)

[that should actually push all the way to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m42s)

[Nougat. Oh, I wonder if my API key is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m44s)

[going to be expired](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m48s)

[given how long it's been since I've](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m50s)

[published this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m51s)

[Let me go log into Nougat and check. Let](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m53s)

[me just log into Nougat real quick](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m56s)

[because I think Nougat API keys are good](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h52m59s)

[for a year](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m02s)

[if I remember right. And I often](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m05s)

[generate separate keys per repo.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m08s)

[You look](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m14s)

[it expired.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m16s)

[Yep, it shows expired.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m19s)

[So let me the regenerate button](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m24s)

[and decopy button.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m30s)

[We go to the settings button](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m33s)

[and we go to the secrets and variables](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m36s)

[and we go to actions](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m39s)

[new get API key. I hit the edit button.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m42s)

[I move this not onto the main screen](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m45s)

[because that's not a great place to do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m48s)

[your API keys. I will update my secret.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m49s)

[And now we have an updated Nougat API](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m54s)

[key.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h53m57s)

[And I don't know what's going to happen.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m00s)

[I don't think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m03s)

[I'm I think it gets a copy of secrets as](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m08s)

[soon as this thing starts. So I I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m10s)

[suspect what's going to happen is we're](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m13s)

[going to get to the push to nougats and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m15s)

[it's going to fail.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m16s)

[Yeah. Key is invalid. has expired or](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m19s)

[does not have permission. Yeah. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m21s)

[Okay. So now the question becomes if I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m23s)

[rerun failed jobs,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m26s)

[will that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m28s)

[get the new secret or not? Some I I can](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m31s)

[never remember the rules around when it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m34s)

[grabs the updated information and when](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m36s)

[it reruns with the previous information.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m38s)

[So worst case scenario, we will delete](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m43s)

[the tag and recreate the tag if we need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m46s)

[to.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m48s)

[But this should](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m50s)

[just work](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m53s)

[again. I can't remember if it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m55s)

[if it will get the updated secret or if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h54m58s)

[I have to actually by rerunning or not.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m00s)

[I can't remember.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m06s)

[But with any luck, we will have this guy](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m10s)

[up modernized and ready and rocking. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m12s)

[that is, I will say, one of the nice](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m16s)

[parts about Copilot. This has made](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m18s)

[modernizing and updating stuff so much](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m20s)

[quicker. You know, when you aren't](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m22s)

[That one of the ones in here. Nope.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m33s)

[We got uh another one here. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m39s)

[hopefully that gets](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m42s)

[that thing going. Okay, come on.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m45s)

[Go, go, go, go, go. Because I'd really](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m48s)

[like to see this thing merge through and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m50s)

[be updated and usable and whatnot. I had](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m52s)

[a colleague tell me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m56s)

[uh earlier this week that even if your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h55m59s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m29s)

[uh is already portable symbol package](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m45s)

[format.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m47s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m49s)

[Okay. And while we're in here,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m54s)

[add in source link for GitHub.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h57m57s)

[So source link is a way so symbol](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m03s)

[packages for people who are unfamiliar](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m05s)

[is the link between your source code and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m07s)

[the compiled assembly.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m10s)

[Um, effectively, if you imagine the the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m12s)

[PDB files that you see in your uh output](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m15s)

[directories when you're doing debug](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m18s)

[builds, those link up your source code](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m19s)

[uh with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m22s)

[uh the relevant or I should say they](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m24s)

[link up the relevant lines in your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m26s)

[source code to the um instructions](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m28s)

[inside of the compile DL. Uh source link](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m32s)

[is a similar way of doing that except](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m36s)

[for it allows it to link to uh a remote](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m38s)

[source. So rather than having to have](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m41s)

[all of that information inside of your](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m43s)

[package, it can just know uh where that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m45s)

[source code lives and then it links into](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m48s)

[a commit hash um so that it can if](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m51s)

[somebody wants to get that source, it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m54s)

[can then pull it down. Great. So go go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h58m56s)

[do the needful and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m02s)

[then pull all that in.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m12s)

[So the the source link nougat packages,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m15s)

[there are separate ones out there](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m19s)

[depending on where your source code is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m20s)

[hosted. So the the key premise with](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m23s)

[source link is that the the source is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m26s)

[hosted somewhere that the person who is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m28s)

[trying to view the source can access. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m31s)

[if it's an open source repo on GitHub,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m34s)

[DevOps, um Bitbucket, etc., uh there are](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m36s)

[separate packages you need because each](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m39s)

[of these source link packages](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m42s)

[um build up the the URL to connect it to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m45s)

[a little bit differently because each](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m49s)

[source provider does something slightly](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m50s)

[different with um each of those.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m53s)

[Restore package verify source link is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=02h59m58s)

[working. I don't know that that actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m00s)

[verifies a darn thing. It just verifies](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m02s)

[that it could find the package, but sure](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m03s)

[fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m05s)

[uh by checking each of the assemblies.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m10s)

[Is there a source link global tool?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m13s)

[Yeah, I was going to say I didn't think](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m21s)

[there was a source link global tool. Um](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m22s)

[what are you doing? You're finding the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m27s)

[PDBs](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m30s)

[and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m34s)

[Source link files are being generated.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m39s)

[Let me read one to make sure it's](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m41s)

[configured correctly.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m42s)

[Sure.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m46s)

[Try again.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m47s)

[Uh build generated s the corresponding.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m52s)

[Let me verify the configuration is](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m55s)

[complete.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m56s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h00m58s)

[Thank you. you've been a wonderful help.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m04s)

[Okay, so that should get me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m06s)

[uh let's see debug type set publish](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m10s)

[repository ul embed on drag sources sets](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m13s)

[those up. Expect to see the same thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m17s)

[on all of these. Great, great, great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m19s)

[That works well. That works well.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m23s)

[Wonderful. Okay. Uh,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m25s)

[nougat. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m29s)

[symbol updates.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m33s)

[Uh, let's see. Uh, Nougat. That's not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m36s)

[how you spell Nougat. Oh, well, great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m40s)

[Send it.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m43s)

[Push. Submit.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m46s)

[And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m49s)

[send that guy on through.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m52s)

[And then we will enable automerge.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h01m55s)

[Enable automerge. Automerge.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m00s)

[We're off to the races. Okay, cool.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m03s)

[And then I'm tempted to push a two](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m08s)

[tempted to push another build from that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m13s)

[immediately, but we might wait for just](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m14s)

[a minute.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m17s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m19s)

[Oh, because it's not it's actually not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m23s)

[going to publish it because of that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m25s)

[I am tempted.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m30s)

[Do I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m35s)

[because it wants to up re-upload the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m41s)

[symbol package.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m44s)

[It claims listed here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m52s)

[Let me just look. I I think it actually](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m56s)

[is there.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h02m59s)

[Let's just do this.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m01s)

[Yeah. So, there's that.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m08s)

[Um, let's do](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m10s)

[Do we have a read me on this repository?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m15s)

[I think I do. I I I'm just looking to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m18s)

[um embed](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m22s)

[something in the Nougat package to make](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m24s)

[it not look so](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m27s)

[Yeah. Um let's do one more change then](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m31s)

[in here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m36s)

[Let's see here. uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m38s)

[update the Nougat packages to use the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m41s)

[uh readme MD in the repo root.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m46s)

[Go.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h03m52s)

[Yeah,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m02s)

[I do have a handful of these old](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m04s)

[projects where I I have not kept them up](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m05s)

[to date and I really need to do better.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m08s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m10s)

[mock was two weeks ago. This one's this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m12s)

[week. Material design will hopefully be](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m14s)

[not too long, assuming they get that WPF](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m17s)

[bug worked out.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m21s)

[What did you change?](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m29s)

[Package read me.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m32s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m35s)

[Oh, and I don't think we need this](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m38s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m39s)

[And we shouldn't need](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m41s)

[this anymore.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m44s)

[Might just take this opportunity to](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m46s)

[clean up a handful of ES Project files](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m48s)

[while we're in here mcking with them.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m51s)

[Anyway,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m53s)

[um let's see.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h04m55s)

[Those are I think still needed](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m01s)

[right lines to file really not](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m06s)

[capitalized properly.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m09s)

[Um MS build task](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m12s)

[I I think it's MS builds. Yeah. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m15s)

[the task is appropriately cased. Um, but](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m19s)

[MS build isn't case sensitive and so I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m21s)

[get away with this. That's bad. So, we](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m24s)

[will fix that. Um,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m28s)

[yeah, we will leave that. Let that stand](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m33s)

[for now. Uh, let's see. To include the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m35s)

[readme. Great.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m38s)

[Go here.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m44s)

[Jump up to here. Pop those changes.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m47s)

[Review them really quick.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m52s)

[Read me is included.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m55s)

[Cleaned that up.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h05m58s)

[Cleaned](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m01s)

[up there. That's all fine. Stage all](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m03s)

[changes. Uh let's see. Let's go](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m07s)

[package read me](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m11s)

[and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m18s)

[Okay. And](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m22s)

[push and do the needful.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m26s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m31s)

[Yep. And off to the races. Okay. Well, I](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m39s)

[think that'll probably do it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m44s)

[for tonight. I will probably get a a 211](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m47s)

[pushed out just to make this thing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m51s)

[happier and then get it going. Um, and](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m54s)

[then probably with any luck reference it](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h06m57s)

[inside of the material design project](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m00s)

[and get that release rolled out. Since](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m02s)

[we aren't revving the dependencies, even](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m04s)

[though we're building with net 10,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m06s)

[the the target framework is still net 8.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m10s)

[So, we can get away with uh being a](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m12s)

[little uh an easier integration and that](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m15s)

[way there's just some nice nice cleanup](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m19s)

[and updated little things in there. So,](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m22s)

[we'll see how that goes. It'll be fine.](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m25s)

[It'll work out great. At least that's my](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m27s)

[plan. So, thank you everyone for coming](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m30s)

[and hanging out. I apologize for the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m32s)

[wacky audio and my browser is refreshing](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m34s)

[all that jazz. So, that was exciting. Uh](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m36s)

[but with that I will tell everybody](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m39s)

[happy coding. As always check out the](https://youtu.be/ucWVhp9L3aY?t=03h07m41s)
