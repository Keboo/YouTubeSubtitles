[older one so I've never actually been to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m20s)

[one there so I'm not entirely clear what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m24s)

[the layout looks like so more hopefully](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m25s)

[more clarity on that as uh it gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m28s)

[closer so I'm sure I'm going to get more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m31s)

[information about you know where I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m33s)

[kind of discussion with people and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m44s)

[talking.net and dev tooling stuff like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m47s)

[absolutely love doing that and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m51s)

[Microsoft lets me go there and do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m53s)

[to be plenty of stuff on uh AI agents](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m00s)

[mcp is really hot right now um Aspire is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m04s)

[cool and we're going to look at some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m07s)

[Aspire tonight so that'll be even cooler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m08s)

[group hey look me um I am speaking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m14s)

[uh I I was about to say next month June](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m18s)

[3rd so it's like six weeks away I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m21s)

[if I'm doing my math right um this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m25s)

[going to be a very fun talk running](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m28s)

[through uh the different C versions and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m30s)

[kind of the we'll call it the highlights](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m34s)

[reel kind of like if you were to read a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m36s)

[history book how you generally you like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m37s)

[you get the the big events throughout](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m40s)

[you know different areas of history this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m42s)

[is going to be that only for C um I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m44s)

[think a lot of it because it's been](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m46s)

[around so long there's actually the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m49s)

[concept of ancient history with C i mean](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m51s)

[ancient and we're talking you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m54s)

[decades not hundreds of years or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m56s)

[thousands or whatever but in this case](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m57s)

[for a programming language that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m59s)

[ancient so uh kind of going through the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m01s)

[the history of where we started kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m04s)

[explaining how we got some of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m07s)

[features that we did based upon how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m08s)

[things go because you know C# wasn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m10s)

[just hatched overnight it it took years](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m12s)

[and years to get to where we're at now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m14s)

[so this is going to be a fun one i I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m17s)

[thoroughly uh going to enjoy this so if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m20s)

[you want regardless of where you're at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m23s)

[whether you're new to C or somewhat](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m24s)

[experienced I'm hoping there's going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m26s)

[be something there mildly new to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m28s)

[everybody at a at a bare minimum coming](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m30s)

[away with kind of a clear understanding](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m33s)

[of some of the features and the why](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m35s)

[behind all of it I think is the the big](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m37s)

[the big goal I have here and more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m39s)

[importantly it's going to be fun to to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m40s)

[show off some cool C stuff um yeah and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m42s)

[intend to go all the way uh to C 14 so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m47s)

[for those people confused that's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m50s)

[version that releases in November](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m52s)

[now there are preview bits and kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m55s)

[hints and the C lang is kind of showing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m58s)

[the direction that they're going so some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m00s)

[of that may end up being you know pseudo](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m01s)

[cody bits or like I may have to pull](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m04s)

[like a nightly build of the net or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m07s)

[something so we'll see we'll see how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m09s)

[that goes we'll see how far we can get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m10s)

[into that but I was going to cover all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m12s)

[the way back from the beginning all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m14s)

[way to theoretically the future because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m16s)

[you know June comes before November so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m18s)

[that will be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m20s)

[exciting okay okay so let's go uh that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m22s)

[the wrong Visual Studio that's what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m27s)

[were working on last time let's not look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m29s)

[at that one let's not look at that one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m31s)

[either hang on one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m32s)

[second there we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m34s)

[go this is what I want yeah payment](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m36s)

[processing but this is not what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m39s)

[going to look at okay what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m40s)

[actually going to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m43s)

[at There we go okay so couple things so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m45s)

[I I know I've shown this solution off a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m51s)

[handful of times but I feel the urge to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m53s)

[show it off more so this is Net Aspire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m56s)

[so for people who haven't seen it and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m00s)

[got to find the right got to find a good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m03s)

[tab to show this we'll go here uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m06s)

[see net Aspire so for people who haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m08s)

[seen Oh not that just want the Aspire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m11s)

[docs yeah there just something simple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m14s)

[just something simple so people who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m17s)

[haven't seen .NET Aspire before this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m18s)

[brings together a lot of different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m22s)

[concepts like some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m25s)

[Aspire is not new like but it bring but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m27s)

[it brings a lot of orchestration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m32s)

[together that that previously you kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m34s)

[of had to glue together yourself and it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m36s)

[wasn't always easy to make um happen um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m38s)

[there are a number of key things that uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m42s)

[go on here and I am not leveraging all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m45s)

[of Aspire aspire will go as far as to um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m48s)

[actually like build out your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m52s)

[infrastructure in Azure for you or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m53s)

[insert other cloud here i think I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m55s)

[know i know that they've been working on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m58s)

[different things i think at present it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m00s)

[just builds out infrastructurees ARM but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m01s)

[I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m03s)

[am I am not trusting um and I like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m04s)

[darn it write my own Terraform myself so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m09s)

[my infrastructure is done in Terraform](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m11s)

[in a separate repo and I just tell](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m12s)

[Aspire no you don't get to do that part](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m14s)

[um as much as I love you I love you not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m17s)

[for that so but it does give this dev](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m21s)

[time orchestration and this this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m24s)

[really really key like this is this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m26s)

[the this is the sweet spot in my opinion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m28s)

[because normally when you've got kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m31s)

[this um I don't want to say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m33s)

[microservices polyglot type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m35s)

[infrastructure you have to stand up a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m37s)

[lot of stuff locally to be able to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m39s)

[up and running you'll note I've got this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m41s)

[fancy little icon it's got a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m43s)

[little purple little purple triangle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m45s)

[here for the Aspire logo and it's and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m48s)

[it's an app host and you'll note this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m50s)

[my startup project and I will likely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m53s)

[never change off of this as my startup](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m55s)

[project and if we look at its program CS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m57s)

[it is not fancy it has a I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m59s)

[leave this guy visible for a second it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m02s)

[using uh top level uh statements so uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m05s)

[implicit mains uh and it's got this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m10s)

[distributed application create a builder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m12s)

[and you'll note in all of this stuff I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m14s)

[just kind of tacking together all of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m16s)

[bits of the back end for Vellopac right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m18s)

[so this is this is our backend SAS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m22s)

[service that we've been uh working on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m24s)

[and so I've got storage stuff I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m26s)

[blob stuff I've got Q's stuff um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m29s)

[I I run Azureite inside of a container](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m33s)

[to be able to uh have something that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m36s)

[simulates uh an Azure storage account](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m40s)

[locally inside of Docker which is great](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m42s)

[um I spin up a SQL server also in Docker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m45s)

[and you'll note this with lifetime](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m48s)

[persistent i'll come back to that in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m49s)

[moment uh it adds in a database and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m51s)

[more importantly for each of my services](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m54s)

[I just tell it which things it needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m56s)

[right my API service is going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m58s)

[pretty much you know the backend blobs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m00s)

[it needs cues it needs the database but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m03s)

[this new partner API and this admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m05s)

[that we're looking at they're only going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m07s)

[to need access to the database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m09s)

[themselves this is glorious because what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m11s)

[this ends up doing let's launch and show](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m13s)

[this this is this this is just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m16s)

[awesome and I am spilling Mountain Dew](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m19s)

[that's not a good sign that is not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m22s)

[good sign if you're spilling Mountain](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m24s)

[Dew this early okay okay bippity bopity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m25s)

[booya come on launch do the thing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m28s)

[does take it a mild it does take a quick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m33s)

[hot minute to launch because you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m35s)

[it's got to do a few things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m36s)

[but aside from this unhandled exception](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m39s)

[occurred what was that uh collection was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m43s)

[modified huh that's interesting okay so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m49s)

[you'll note this guy is fired up and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m54s)

[now have a list of all of my resources i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m56s)

[can see my SQL server is apparently](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m58s)

[running but unhealthy which means I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m00s)

[probably need to look at my Docker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m02s)

[container and figure out what the heck](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m03s)

[right worst case scenario I just torch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m05s)

[the container and call it a day that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m08s)

[the beautiful thing about this and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m10s)

[you'll note it did come up and start](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m11s)

[running my payment updator finished but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m12s)

[it had three errors in the logs great](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m15s)

[i'm gonna ignore that for now because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m17s)

[I'm fairly confident it's the fact that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m18s)

[I don't have an updated key in my user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m20s)

[secrets and that's not something I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m22s)

[to fix on stream so I'll do that later](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m24s)

[plus I don't care but you'll note SQL](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m26s)

[Server database i've got my storage it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m28s)

[got blobs and cues under it and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m31s)

[I've got a whole bunch of services and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m32s)

[things running i even have just a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m33s)

[straight CLI executable here right this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m35s)

[is running the Stripe CLI because we use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m38s)

[Stripe for payments and it's just like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m40s)

[it's built up the invocation and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m43s)

[launched that and if I want I can just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m45s)

[drop right in and I boom right don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m48s)

[worry that's not a real secret in case](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m51s)

[you were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m54s)

[worried so this guy is fired up we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m56s)

[off and running we've got the the admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m00s)

[API which is what uh the admin and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m03s)

[partner API are the things I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m05s)

[work on but I've also got these you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m07s)

[see I've got hyperlinks out to to go and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m09s)

[look at these i can see the the console](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m11s)

[logs if I want if I want to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m14s)

[structured logs I can actually dive in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m15s)

[here and get fullon um uh infrastructure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m18s)

[level logging oh it looks like the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m22s)

[errors that it flagged were likely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m25s)

[because I have two local databases and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m27s)

[they have different gooids for their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m30s)

[teams in them what a shock um but we can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m31s)

[we can actually dive in and take a look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m34s)

[at these traces and we can actually see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m37s)

[a full trace of how long various things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m40s)

[ended up taking which is just glorious](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m42s)

[um so you get structured logs and trace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m45s)

[viewing through everything um you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m48s)

[pick which service you're interested in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m51s)

[taking a look at uh let's see console](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m52s)

[logs you can pull from any of the things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m55s)

[i'm only feeding structured logs from my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m57s)

[my services because I don't think the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m00s)

[other ones I don't know how to configure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m02s)

[them for structured logging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m04s)

[frankly but yeah all of those set up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m06s)

[i've got metrics if I want to go through](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m09s)

[and figure out oh okay let's figure out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m10s)

[you know how many open connections are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m13s)

[running one which I'm going to go with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m15s)

[is probably my Aspire host but you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m18s)

[pull back all of this kind of like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m21s)

[Prometheus level metric stuff which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m22s)

[just glory like you get all of this with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m24s)

[Aspire which is again you can plug all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m26s)

[these bits together if you want aside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m29s)

[from this pretty dashboard I don't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m31s)

[that any of this stuff was unattainable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m34s)

[before you just have to you had to build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m37s)

[all that glue yourself which sucked](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m39s)

[right nobody wants to do this other cool](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m41s)

[thing you can just arbitrarily stop](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m43s)

[stuff if you want which is I I think a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m46s)

[newer feature of this dashboard um but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m47s)

[yeah or restart one of these which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m51s)

[kind of cool because before I always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m53s)

[just come in and restart the entire app](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m55s)

[host but now if you want to pick on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m56s)

[individual resources you can get those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m57s)

[guys going too which is very very slick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m59s)

[and all of this from being able to build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m04s)

[these up oh I wanted to show off the so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m06s)

[the admin API all right right so if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m08s)

[just click on this row here you'll see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m11s)

[that I've got all of this stuff set up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m12s)

[and it's got ports and whatnot exposed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m15s)

[but you'll note down here because I said](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m17s)

[with reference database I have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m20s)

[connection string for my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m22s)

[database right like this is this is very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m24s)

[slick and yes you're about to see a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m27s)

[username and password i'm not worried](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m29s)

[this is local only you'd have to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m31s)

[access to my Docker instance and if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m32s)

[have access to that that's a different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m34s)

[thing plus it's going to cycle every](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m35s)

[time I reboot my container but you'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m37s)

[note when it spun that SQL Server Docker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m39s)

[image it dealt with the issue of being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m42s)

[able to go through figure out what the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m44s)

[connection string needed to look like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m47s)

[and then promptly injected that into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m49s)

[everywhere that I said reference my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m52s)

[database right again this is things you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m53s)

[can do yourself but spinning up a SQL](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m56s)

[server inside of Docker for you pulling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m59s)

[out the connection string setting that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m01s)

[as an environment variable as the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m03s)

[startup for all these other projects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m05s)

[knowing the dependency between them and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m07s)

[then launching all of them like you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m08s)

[do all that like that's not like people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m10s)

[have built that kind of stuff already](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m13s)

[and you know they've got multi-pro](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m15s)

[startups and scripts and various things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m16s)

[it's like great but I pressed F5 which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m18s)

[is pretty slick absolutely absolutely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m21s)

[slick in my opinion so and then it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m25s)

[builds up all of this stuff and you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m27s)

[see I have I've got a little kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m28s)

[hacky thing going on here because my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m31s)

[front end code lives in a separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m33s)

[repository so I just go you know what if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m35s)

[that repository is checked out kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m38s)

[alongside me let's use it npm app off to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m40s)

[the races away we go done right so it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m44s)

[it's a little hacky because you know if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m47s)

[the repository isn't checked out I won't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m49s)

[get a front end in my thing eh not not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m50s)

[big deal right that's that's at some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m56s)

[point I might try to do it because there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m59s)

[there's a Aspire definitely pushes you a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m01s)

[little bit towards a monor repo right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m04s)

[and there's a big debate monor repo poly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m07s)

[repo where should things live how should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m09s)

[they be structured yada yada yada like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m10s)

[you can do this any number of ways this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m14s)

[is the way I chose to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m16s)

[it okay so admin and partner API so what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m19s)

[is what is going on here so Bellipac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m24s)

[backend SAS service we want to be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m28s)

[to um effectively build out and sell uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m30s)

[this hosting solution for people who are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m36s)

[building your installers with Vellopac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m38s)

[the the the SDK and the tooling that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m40s)

[out in the open source repo it gets you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m43s)

[far enough to where it's got your app](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m45s)

[package you got your installers it's got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m47s)

[some upload commands to send it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m49s)

[somewhere but it that that's kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m51s)

[where it goes hands off basically it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m53s)

[points you in the right direction of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m55s)

[where you need to go to upload stuff and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m56s)

[then says you know what all that hosting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m58s)

[stuff that's on you i'm not like I'm not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m00s)

[helping you um partly because that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m02s)

[kind of complicated to do without some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m04s)

[level of ownership so it's like we put](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m06s)

[the tools in the hands and then kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m08s)

[back off but for people who kind of want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m10s)

[a uh a full solution an end toend thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m12s)

[it's like well you help me get my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m16s)

[installer like now send it to my users](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m18s)

[please right that's where our SAS comes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m20s)

[in that's where we are looking to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m22s)

[uh a free there there's going to be I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m25s)

[think three tiers when we when we launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m27s)

[free dev and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m30s)

[pro pricing and ter stuff TBD um but we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m31s)

[have some people looking to potentially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m37s)

[partner with us and as part of that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m39s)

[wanted to have the the partners be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m42s)

[to effectively generate um coupon codes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m45s)

[right so that when when people buy stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m49s)

[from the partner um the partner can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m52s)

[offer them and say "Hey you know we've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m54s)

[got this making up numbers here right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m56s)

[40% off coupon for for Velopac if you'd](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m59s)

[like to go and use them right that way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m02s)

[whatever." Right details TBD](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m13s)

[but what that means is I need partners](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m17s)

[able to generate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m20s)

[coupons that will work on mine](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m22s)

[preferably and this is where things are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m25s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m26s)

[get let me see if I can find my tab so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m27s)

[this is where things are going to get a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m31s)

[little bit interesting so Stripe API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m33s)

[promotion code so we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m37s)

[little little rundown on how Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m39s)

[works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m42s)

[so Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m43s)

[has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m46s)

[coupons right and the coupon object and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m48s)

[take all of the stripe take all of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m52s)

[sample object stuff on the right with a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m54s)

[grain of salt as I've learned with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m56s)

[Stripe's documentation it's like 95%](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m57s)

[there and that other 5% really messes me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m59s)

[with me when it's wrong um kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m02s)

[annoying uh and you'll note I am in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m04s)

[test environment here so this is not the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m08s)

[production one no one panic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m10s)

[um so the coupon itself uh defines uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m13s)

[effectively the the discount what it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m18s)

[applies to you know percent off all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m20s)

[that kind of stuff right so the coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m23s)

[defines the amount where it goes to but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m25s)

[then the promotion code is what actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m28s)

[gets shared um for what you might enter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m31s)

[right it's one of these types of codes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m35s)

[here right and valid characters are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m37s)

[lowerase uppercase and digits that's all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m40s)

[you're allowed to do um and you can kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m42s)

[of make up whatever whatever you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m45s)

[be the only restriction is these things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m47s)

[must be unique across all active](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m50s)

[promotion codes so once you once you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m53s)

[make one of these things you can't do uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m56s)

[duplicate it without uh without running](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m59s)

[into it and I think the intent of what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m02s)

[would like to do is I would like to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m05s)

[my admin portal create the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m07s)

[coupon generate uh an API key that the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m10s)

[partner can use the partner can call the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m14s)

[partner API to get back a coupon code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m17s)

[that they can then hand to their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m20s)

[customers that's what I think I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m21s)

[right that way there's there's some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m24s)

[level of control in that I'm the one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m25s)

[setting up the coupon i know who I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m28s)

[handing out that API key to i can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m30s)

[authenticate the requests that come in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m32s)

[from it um and if there's a you know a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m34s)

[discussion that needs to have of oh well](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m38s)

[we would like the the coupon to be you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m39s)

[know different amount or whatever great](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m41s)

[fine we can have those discussions right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m42s)

[but then they can generate the promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m44s)

[code because the the thing that gets me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m46s)

[is there's with that because the people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m49s)

[they're handing this to may not have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m53s)

[Velopac accounts I can't tie it to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m54s)

[anything in my system immediately right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m56s)

[i've got nothing as far as I'm concerned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m59s)

[the user doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m00s)

[so all I can do is hand them this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m02s)

[promotion code um with potentially like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m04s)

[some number of redemptions uh that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m07s)

[could be redeemed on um some expiration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m10s)

[or similar and and we can you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m13s)

[negotiate what those things should be at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m15s)

[obviously it should probably come back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m17s)

[uh uh as active to to make sure that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m20s)

[it's uh good to go um but then being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m24s)

[able to hand that back so that they can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m27s)

[then include it in whatever manner makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m29s)

[sense to hand to their customers to say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m31s)

["Here you go here's a wonderful you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m32s)

[coupon code that we generated yada yada](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m35s)

[yada right?" And then if there's ever a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m37s)

[problem something gets compromised I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m39s)

[just either cycle the coupon I can cycle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m40s)

[the key whatever and everything just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m42s)

[works that's what I think I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m45s)

[build that's the game plan of what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m47s)

[have started on now obviously there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m49s)

[multiple levels of off that need to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m53s)

[on here and so inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m55s)

[my Vellopac stuff I have spun multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m58s)

[projects so I have no fewer than three](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m02s)

[web API projects at the moment so the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m06s)

[API service is kind of the main service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m09s)

[one that that does most of the stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m11s)

[around Vellopac flow it's it's for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m13s)

[consumers right it supports the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m16s)

[front-end website that's where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m18s)

[upload your releases it backs the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m19s)

[website showing you your channels your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m22s)

[release groups all of that kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m23s)

[interesting stuff right that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m25s)

[fine so that's fine that lives there it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m27s)

[gets to be fat dumb and happy right but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m30s)

[then I have the admin API which I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m32s)

[to So the the API service is using um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m35s)

[MEL and Azure B2C um to authenticate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m39s)

[users right that way you can log in with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m42s)

[your Microsoft account your GitHub your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m44s)

[Google right those types of things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m46s)

[the admin API i don't want to work that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m48s)

[way i want it to off um based upon a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m52s)

[security group in our AD because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m55s)

[only people that should be hitting the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m57s)

[admin API are functionally people who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m58s)

[work for Velopac that should be about it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m02s)

[and really the admin API all it's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m05s)

[to have is the stuff to be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m07s)

[create create those uh partners and I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m10s)

[say create partner but it's really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m14s)

[creating a key that a partner can use to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m15s)

[access a coupon and thank you for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m17s)

[follow friends we appreciate it um and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m19s)

[then the partner API is obviously then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m23s)

[for the partner to call to generate one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m25s)

[of these suckers right that's where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m27s)

[we're going right so on my database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m28s)

[because I've already started this branch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m32s)

[so I'm off I'm off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m33s)

[pow-wowing so we'll make this we'll make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m36s)

[this bigger i've got some basic I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m38s)

[some basic projects and a little bit of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m40s)

[stuff stubbed in that's as far as I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m42s)

[got just to be clear this is not working](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m44s)

[yet um but we'll go through here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m46s)

[show so I've got this partner coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m49s)

[code that I'm going to have in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m51s)

[database right there's an API key which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m52s)

[I I I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m54s)

[basically do HMAC authentication all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m56s)

[way through i think that makes it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m58s)

[easiest right i think so we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m00s)

[roll with it until I have a reason not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m04s)

[to um there is going to be a name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m05s)

[because you know I need to attach](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m08s)

[something useful and then there will be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m10s)

[a Stripe coupon ID because all IDs from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m11s)

[Stripe are in there right so that's in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m14s)

[my that's in my DB context i've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m16s)

[generated a migration that that sets up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m19s)

[the table and that's as far as this data](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m21s)

[project goes i thought about splitting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m24s)

[this up and going well you know maybe I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m26s)

[should have a separate DB context and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m27s)

[split these out because these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m29s)

[technically don't need to be tied to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m30s)

[other one and then I realized Yagney](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m32s)

[Yagney](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m34s)

[Yagy don't do it till you have a reason](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m35s)

[to right like I don't I don't anticipate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m38s)

[this API getting flooded specifically it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m41s)

[shouldn't get flooded more than my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m44s)

[public facing one that should be the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m46s)

[lion share of the traffic so it's like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m47s)

[no no I'm not going to I'm not going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m51s)

[spin a whole separate database with you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m53s)

[know different replicas and that kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m55s)

[thing it's like not till I need it so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m56s)

[put it all here i may need to break it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m59s)

[later but for now it's all going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m01s)

[together and then just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m05s)

[for kind of some reference here there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m07s)

[this velop pack service core and for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m10s)

[anybody who spins up an Azure project um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m12s)

[they they create what are the service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m16s)

[common I think is what they call it i I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m18s)

[renamed it but one of the key things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m20s)

[that they have is this service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m23s)

[collection extensions where it basically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m24s)

[it's just a shared place to do all your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m27s)

[DI stuff right so it maps some health](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m29s)

[checks and set those up huzzah all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m32s)

[that works right there's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m34s)

[service defaults for building these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m36s)

[things up huzzah all of that works right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m38s)

[i've got my top level thing for just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m40s)

[adding in all of my my Vellopac services](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m43s)

[this to-do comment is actually supposed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m46s)

[to be here um I don't know that there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m48s)

[actually a cleaner way to do this given](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m51s)

[order of operations but you know what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m53s)

[i'm going to leave the to-do there for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m54s)

[now anyway so there's that okay so let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m55s)

[back up and let's let's take a look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m59s)

[admin API and I think we are fired up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m02s)

[and running right now aren't we too many](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m05s)

[tabs too many](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m08s)

[tabs okay so admin API click here oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m10s)

[this is one other thing that's worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m14s)

[noting you'll note these links here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m15s)

[these are entirely powered by your I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m18s)

[shouldn't say entirely powered by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m22s)

[default that's a better way of saying it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m23s)

[by default these are just your launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m26s)

[settings.json right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m29s)

[uh yeah so there's your launch URL and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m33s)

[how it picked up swagger was the fact](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m36s)

[that this is what it would launch if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m38s)

[were to run with F5 in my launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m41s)

[settings so Aspire has gone "Oh those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m43s)

[are the default settings that you want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m47s)

[let me just go ahead and wire those up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m50s)

[for you." Again love it love it love it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m51s)

[love it love it um so it gets us into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m55s)

[here we can authorize i can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m59s)

[authorize huzzah great right and I come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m02s)

[in here this is the weather forecast i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m04s)

[hit execute boom i got a 200 we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m06s)

[cruising okay so mild amount of O](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m10s)

[without any real checking but I have O](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m14s)

[on the the admin service and we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m17s)

[the default weather forecast which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m20s)

[your ASP.N.ET core out of the box](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m22s)

[doohickey stuff great okay so admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m25s)

[we need to go through and build out uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m29s)

[an API endpoint that can spin a partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m32s)

[uh and it needs to take in a I think a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m36s)

[string for the name of the partner and a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m39s)

[string for the Stripe coupon code at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m42s)

[some point we may do some validation of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m44s)

[it we'll see we'll see because I I'd](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m46s)

[like to see all of that all of that work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m49s)

[and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m52s)

[think yeah because I saw my other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m53s)

[service work my user secrets should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m55s)

[set up for Stripe already so I should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m57s)

[good to go should be good to go one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m59s)

[other thing that I have done that I very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m01s)

[much love so I have a directory build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m03s)

[props file and uh where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m06s)

[it i this is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m10s)

[you'll see if you look at my net](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m12s)

[templates repo i enjoy putting my user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m14s)

[secrets in my directory build props now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m17s)

[it is worth noting what this does this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m20s)

[makes the sweeping assumption that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m23s)

[want to share a single user secrets file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m26s)

[with all of my projects this may not be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m29s)

[true for everybody because you might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m32s)

[have you know two different things that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m35s)

[you're like "Oh shoot i need an Azure ID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m37s)

[section but I need them different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m39s)

[between these two services." If that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m40s)

[the case this is not the solution for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m42s)

[you just want to be clear it may not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m44s)

[work for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m46s)

[everybody but it works really well](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m47s)

[because the number of times I get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m49s)

[annoyed of having to copy user secrets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m51s)

[from project A to project B to project C](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m53s)

[it's because if you just use the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m55s)

[built-in Visual Studio tooling it'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m57s)

[generate you a separate GID for every](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m58s)

[project pro tip you you can copy and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m00s)

[paste the GOID around right like you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m04s)

[could have like if you were to put this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m06s)

[user secrets ID in three different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m08s)

[projects all three of those projects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m10s)

[will share the same user secrets file if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m12s)

[if there is reasonable sharing that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m15s)

[could happen between them go ahead and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m17s)

[do it like the user secrets are local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m19s)

[user secrets these aren't like shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m21s)

[out on the environments or whatever uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m24s)

[so don't copy and paste between user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m27s)

[secrets files like just share them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m30s)

[together where it makes sense so that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m33s)

[that is a lovely way of handling okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m37s)

[boom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m42s)

[so the other thing that I have done is I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m43s)

[have kind of structured a handful of my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m46s)

[APIs in the following way of kind of top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m48s)

[level groupings like what you might see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m51s)

[in swagger so if we look at I look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m54s)

[the API here right for my my public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m57s)

[facing API you can see I've got API keys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m59s)

[I've got off I've got payments projects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m01s)

[releases teams users right that's kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m04s)

[of my top level thing and you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m06s)

[I'm I'm versioning my APIs now I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m09s)

[have an API sitting in front of this or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m12s)

[or any of that nature yet right again](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m15s)

[this is one of those I had to go yagnney](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m18s)

[yagny yagnney stand it up once you have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m20s)

[a justification for needing it for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m23s)

[we're just doing versioning uh within](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m26s)

[the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m28s)

[itself for now it works just fine i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m30s)

[don't have an issue i may have an issue](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m33s)

[in the future and I will address it then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m34s)

[so for the admin API we are going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m37s)

[with uh I think partner is pro oh I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m41s)

[to let's leave it running though let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m44s)

[detach that way it doesn't kill it okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m47s)

[so let's call it partner right right and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m50s)

[inside of each of these I've kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m53s)

[done this thing where I put an extension](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m55s)

[which does the mapping of the endpoints](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m57s)

[and then uh the the V1 to be able to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m00s)

[through and handle this it's just kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m04s)

[of the structure that I decided that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m05s)

[liked uh and so I am going to continue](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m07s)

[it because you know what it worked well](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m10s)

[the first time so we're going to keep](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m12s)

[going with that uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m13s)

[uh partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m16s)

[extensions great and this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m20s)

[end up being a static class because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m22s)

[we're going to do this sort of thingy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m24s)

[mabobber here and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m26s)

[kind of just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m28s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m30s)

[this and bring it in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m32s)

[here and so map](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m35s)

[um I am also using minimal APIs um part](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m40s)

[of this project was I was like you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m43s)

[what minimal APIs look cool I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m44s)

[try them so I did uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m47s)

[see partners and then so this is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m52s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m56s)

[be trying to decide if I want it if this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m59s)

[should be pluralized or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m03s)

[not i don't think so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m08s)

[with this okay uh make sure they all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m10s)

[require O and then the question becomes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m14s)

[I probably want to a list i probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m18s)

[want a get i probably want a create i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m20s)

[don't know if I want an update i think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m24s)

[we're going to end up with just a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m26s)

[delete i suppose there might be an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m28s)

[argument for an update for like the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m31s)

[name yeah we'll we'll leave an update in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m33s)

[there and then the rest of these I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m36s)

[think are going to matter for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m38s)

[me we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m39s)

[just we're just going to whack all those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m42s)

[okay okay so now we need inside of here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m45s)

[we're going to go add new folder we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m48s)

[going to do a V1 and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m51s)

[what did I call the ones down here just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m53s)

[methods yeah so it's going to be partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m56s)

[methods inside of here add new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m57s)

[class partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m01s)

[methods and this becomes a static class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m04s)

[and then everywhere I have this we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m08s)

[going to go here we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m11s)

[with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m14s)

[methods uh let's see let's replace all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m16s)

[in here it's control](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m19s)

[A alt A that's why it wasn't working](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m21s)

[okay thank you and then we go here we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m25s)

[bring that sucker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m29s)

[in get rid of you there we go okay so uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m30s)

[list partners](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m37s)

[get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m41s)

[partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m43s)

[create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m45s)

[partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m48s)

[update partner and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m51s)

[delete partner there we go huzzah huzzah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m54s)

[huzzah and then I need my routes my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m59s)

[routes my routes my routes where did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m02s)

[put these i'm trying to remember oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m04s)

[right at the bloody](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m06s)

[bottom yeah so I just want that part of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m08s)

[it and then I would like team routes to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m14s)

[become let's see this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m19s)

[be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m23s)

[partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m25s)

[routes we go that updates all of those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m28s)

[and then everywhere I have the word team](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m32s)

[we're going to replace with the word](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m36s)

[partner probably could have done that at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m37s)

[the beginning and saved myself some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m40s)

[effort that's going to get me pretty](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m43s)

[darn close to what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m45s)

[want so aside from the fact that none of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m48s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m51s)

[work and we might have to refactor some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m52s)

[stuff but that's okay that is okay that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m55s)

[is what we do okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m57s)

[gen all of these things up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m00s)

[um going to have to look at some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m06s)

[those methods that are not resolving are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m08s)

[extensions and things that I've built so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m10s)

[we may have to we may have to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m12s)

[things in i've got a shared library](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m14s)

[where that all of these projects are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m16s)

[referencing that we can pull those into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m17s)

[and let's just verify that I have it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m20s)

[referenced uh this guy is referencing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m22s)

[none of my projects so let's let's fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m24s)

[that real quick because service core is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m26s)

[absolutely something we want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m30s)

[reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m31s)

[because that's where the shared stuff's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m34s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m36s)

[I'm going to just clean that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m51s)

[up okay okay and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m54s)

[just go into here and let's take a look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m56s)

[at choir team member what was what's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m01s)

[this extension here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m04s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m06s)

[um this is adding a policy and I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m11s)

[think I'm going to need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m15s)

[here uh nope that's the wrong one i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m19s)

[don't need I don't need that here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m23s)

[because authorization is going to be if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m25s)

[you can authorize against this service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m28s)

[you're going to be good to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m30s)

[go I think is the way this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m32s)

[work uh let's see let's make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m36s)

[public public it doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m41s)

[for the purposes of testing because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m44s)

[way we're going to test this is more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m47s)

[from a functional standpoint um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m49s)

[I I use a web application factory to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m53s)

[stand up an in-memory instance of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m56s)

[service so that it can test the full](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m57s)

[middleware now because if you just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m02s)

[invoke like your your minimal API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m04s)

[methods directly or you invoke your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m06s)

[controller methods if you're you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m08s)

[going that route with your ASP.NET core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m10s)

[um like that's fine for testing the code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m12s)

[within the method but you've skipped all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m15s)

[of that middleware and routing and stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m18s)

[that that leads to a a request making it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m20s)

[to that method whereas if you stand up a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m23s)

[web application factory you can validate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m26s)

[things like routing is set up the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m27s)

[you expect more importantly the tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m29s)

[then serve as a really nice place to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m31s)

[show off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m34s)

[uh what the capabilities of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m36s)

[uh your methods are what are you there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m39s)

[an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m43s)

[update i have to have it yesterday at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m47s)

[11:04 you can tell I haven't been on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m50s)

[this machine since yesterday at 11:04 uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m52s)

[because I would have definitely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m55s)

[installed that update if I had seen it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m56s)

[then i'll leave the bell i'll grab it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m57s)

[later](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m59s)

[okay so we need the uh what namespace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m02s)

[was I putting my request classes in are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m06s)

[these all off in the models yeah we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m08s)

[going to go here and I'm going to do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m10s)

[same same kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m12s)

[pattern um and I've been versioning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m15s)

[these models which are effectively the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m18s)

[the Poco request responses](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m20s)

[um with the intent that if I need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m23s)

[change something because once this goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m25s)

[live um I've got snapshot tests around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m27s)

[my my swagger uh open API spec so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m30s)

[there should be no breaking API changes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m34s)

[that I am unaware of like you have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m37s)

[explicitly make a change to that test in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m39s)

[order for it to go through it's a very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m42s)

[obnoxious test and annoys the living](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m43s)

[daylights out of me um but that is okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m45s)

[because that is exactly what we want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m47s)

[right is I want to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m50s)

[need component models here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m11s)

[so because that'll get that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m16s)

[working and then this should resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m18s)

[great and then I need my validate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m21s)

[and talking out loud it's remarkable how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m08s)

[many times that that solves your problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m12s)

[right just literally take your hands off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m15s)

[they do it in a more socially acceptable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m22s)

[whiteboard and they like grab a pen and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m25s)

[they hold it in their hand and they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m27s)

[spend the whole time talking without](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m28s)

[actually writing on the whiteboard and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m29s)

[so it feels more socially acceptable to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m31s)

[do that some people prefer their ducks](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m33s)

[to be humans but the person they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m35s)

[name because I don't think there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m57s)

[anything I think if I needed to update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m59s)

[anything other than the name on a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m01s)

[partner I would just delete and create a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m04s)

[editing of like the data inside of it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m12s)

[that's probably a better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m29s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m31s)

[that I think that it's long and wordy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m47s)

[but I'm the only one who has to look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m51s)

[the long wordy name we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m53s)

[with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m55s)

[that because if we have other partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m57s)

[functions they'll be a little different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h47m00s)

[so we might actually go back up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h47m04s)

[we'll we'll we'll pick on like the list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m05s)

[one right because this is as simple as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m08s)

[it gets right when I hover over map get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m10s)

[you'll note something here right this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m13s)

[the return type here is route handler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m15s)

[get delegate handler right if we come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m22s)

[over here and hover on it you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m25s)

[we've landed on a different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m28s)

[overload right and you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m32s)

[specifically this is a request delegate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m34s)

[this is the overload that's different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m37s)

[right so that's what's biting me and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m40s)

[reason it's biting me is because if we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m42s)

[go over and look at this guy this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m44s)

[was declared something like this which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m46s)

[is fine right if we were to look at and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m48s)

[I think if I F12 on here I can get to it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m51s)

[right if I come in here and take a look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m54s)

[at this if I look at a request delegate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m56s)

[this and went well all I see is map get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m15s)

[I don't know which of the overloads you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m17s)

[want i'm just going to pick what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m18s)

[presume to be the first one which was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m20s)

[the request delegate and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m22s)

[generate you something that matches that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m23s)

[right so if we come here right and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m25s)

[change specifically this one up right so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m28s)

[this is request delegate syntax if I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m31s)

[this magically it now works right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m35s)

[deleting the HTTP context out of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m39s)

[parameter set now means that I resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m43s)

[to a different overload specifically one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m46s)

[that is a delegate type overload right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m48s)

[that didn't grab well right delegate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m52s)

[type overload which returns a route](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m55s)

[handler builder which now works right so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m57s)

[the short version is I trusted the too](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m00s)

[much in the IDE uh and it hosed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m03s)

[me and we really don't need the HTTP](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m07s)

[context in any of these things so we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m10s)

[just not going to use it anywhere boom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m12s)

[boom boom boom boom boom this should now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m16s)

[update boom we now land on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m18s)

[appropriate overload off to the races](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m21s)

[huzzah right overload resolution if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m23s)

[do like minimal APIs where there's a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m26s)

[of this method group kind of function](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m28s)

[mapping stuff it's a good idea to to pay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m31s)

[very very close attention because oftent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m34s)

[times with delegates and method groups](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m37s)

[the compiler has to infer which overload](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m39s)

[you're doing based on the parameters and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m42s)

[that's not always like you'll note I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m44s)

[didn't change any lines of code here so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m47s)

[even though the red squiggle was here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m49s)

[the fix was somewhere else so it's it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m51s)

[one of those things that you just have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m54s)

[to uh be very uh diligent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m55s)

[about okay now we go here now we go here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m59s)

[and I'm going to close some of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m03s)

[things up i've got too much open see I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m04s)

[cannot tolerate those things and I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m07s)

[going to just take this guy and I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m08s)

[going to put him off to the side and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m10s)

[we're going to need a couple of things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m12s)

[so with with minimal APIs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m13s)

[uh let's see I do not like the order it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m16s)

[put these things in we I like these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m18s)

[methods to be in the order in which they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m21s)

[existed so with minimal APIs you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m23s)

[actually do strongly typed uh response](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m26s)

[codes like this like there's an okay a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m29s)

[not found etc etc etc and we'll get down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m31s)

[to doing multiple like there's a results](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m34s)

[class for when an API might return](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m36s)

[multiple different response codes right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m38s)

[so you can kind of in this case it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m41s)

[going to return an okay or a not found](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m42s)

[whereas a list endpoint it's just going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m44s)

[to like it's going to return an okay and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m46s)

[this is from this method itself right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m49s)

[there's middleware higher up that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m51s)

[doing off and other things so like 401's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m53s)

[and those types of things are still](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m56s)

[possible earlier in the food chain but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m57s)

[at this point once you know we're we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m59s)

[off we're in we've got a user right and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m01s)

[we're doing this work listing the stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m04s)

[there's there's really just the one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m06s)

[right so we're going to end up in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m08s)

[similar situation here and we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m09s)

[to need a list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m11s)

[uh and I think we're going to change the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m14s)

[name of this method because we changed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m20s)

[um I'm kind of thinking that what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m23s)

[going to do is I want to because I added](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m25s)

[promotion codes here i think I'm going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m28s)

[to rename this to partner promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m30s)

[methods just uh would you also like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m34s)

[rename yes yes I would thank you that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m37s)

[way it's that way it's a little more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m40s)

[clear right again this extension may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m41s)

[shell out to different classes but for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m44s)

[now this is where the promotion codes go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m46s)

[and you know I may break out partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m48s)

[into its own group and blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m50s)

[deal with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m52s)

[that because we may nest this this stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m53s)

[in a little bit but we want to want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m56s)

[stay consistent okay but for my models I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m58s)

[need a list response i'm going to just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m01s)

[go down here and blatantly steal from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m03s)

[my my thingyama bobber because this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m07s)

[is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m11s)

[here do something like this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m13s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m16s)

[partner promotion code list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m19s)

[response](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m23s)

[um trying to decide what we what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m28s)

[return back here because the other one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m31s)

[here right we're returning a team or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m33s)

[it's going to be something like this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m35s)

[like we can start here but this is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m36s)

[is vastly off right so it probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m38s)

[should be a partner promotion code is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m41s)

[the appropriate type it's going to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m44s)

[an ID it's going to have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m45s)

[name but now the question is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m47s)

[I I think I can return the Stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m51s)

[code as part of it there's nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m54s)

[overly secret about that having that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m56s)

[doesn't get you anything but I think for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m58s)

[the API code I don't want that in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m00s)

[list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m03s)

[response in fact we may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m06s)

[not we may only want to return it when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m08s)

[we create it we do something similar for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m11s)

[the API keys when we generate them is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m13s)

[they don't like you don't get them back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m15s)

[you get them once and that's it after](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m18s)

[that they're locked away in the database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m21s)

[and your choices delete and recreate i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m22s)

[think we're going to follow a similar](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m24s)

[pattern here i think that makes a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m26s)

[sense uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m29s)

[here and I think we slap an S on that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m32s)

[and call it a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m34s)

[day uh great that gets me to there that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m36s)

[gets me to there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m40s)

[so we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m42s)

[here list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m43s)

[uh what did I just call that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m48s)

[thing oh partner promotion codes list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m51s)

[response got it right so you got to got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m54s)

[to name it properly okay there's that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m57s)

[and then we are going to need a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m59s)

[uh Velopac context uh I think I just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m02s)

[have been calling this context elsewhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m07s)

[and this is where we get need to pull it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m09s)

[back out so this is actually going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m11s)

[very similar to the teams one and we can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m14s)

[get away with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m16s)

[some Oh let's not do let's not look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m20s)

[teams let's look at the API key ones i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m23s)

[think those ones might be a slightly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m25s)

[better let's create yeah because I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m29s)

[we can get away with just effectively](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m32s)

[doing the same thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m34s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m38s)

[care don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m39s)

[care there we go putting okay so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m42s)

[going to be partner coupon codes we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m45s)

[don't care about this this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m49s)

[be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m52s)

[uh partner promotion code oh we should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m54s)

[re We're going to have to rename the D](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m57s)

[that's gonna be fun h we'll do that with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m01s)

[that that deal with that in a minute uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m03s)

[and then I do want a cancellation token](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m05s)

[uh because I'd like to be able to cancel](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m09s)

[this and then we've got ID name and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m11s)

[it's going to be X stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m16s)

[ID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m19s)

[right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m22s)

[um see the other one was a constructor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m26s)

[this one was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m28s)

[named guess it doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m31s)

[doesn't really make a big difference one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m34s)

[way or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m36s)

[another](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m36s)

[uh that do that do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m40s)

[that because EF Core is okay with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m47s)

[this for their uh projection the select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m52s)

[method here and then this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m56s)

[require including the entity framework](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m58s)

[core this is pulling out an array](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m00s)

[uh partner promotion list response and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m05s)

[then this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m07s)

[becomes partner promotion codes we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m08s)

[rename](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m11s)

[this partner promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m12s)

[codes because this really is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m17s)

[dump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m20s)

[everything is there a benefit to soft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m22s)

[delete versus hard delete](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m25s)

[i don't think so i don't think I have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m32s)

[reason to save for soft delete so we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m34s)

[literally going to be dumping all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m36s)

[records out of this table but this table](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m39s)

[is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m40s)

[be small so just to be clear generally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m41s)

[hitting a a DB set and just blindly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m46s)

[pulling everything out into an array](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m49s)

[this is a recipe for disaster do not do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m51s)

[this on any table that might grow right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m54s)

[in this case it's gonna be a small one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m58s)

[so I'm not going to worry about it yagy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m00s)

[yagny yagny not until I need it not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m03s)

[until I need it uh and so for now that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m06s)

[gets me there great okay next we need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m09s)

[um we need the create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m15s)

[method i think that was right here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m17s)

[create API key request so we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m21s)

[do do effectively the same thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m25s)

[things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m45s)

[very clearcut pattern here um it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m50s)

[actually got to be careful how I phrase](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m55s)

[you this thing is pretty freaking sweet](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m28s)

[um effectively it like where I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m34s)

[building out these middle tier layers of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m37s)

[of doing it it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m39s)

[generate everything from your D like it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m41s)

[takes your DB context and its models as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m44s)

[its input and it will generate you the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m47s)

[controllers and everything all the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m49s)

[out to the front end and give you like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m51s)

[refresh stuff so it lets you build a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m53s)

[of this stuff very very quickly um and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m56s)

[then you have to basically decorate your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m59s)

[your EF models with uh annotations or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m01s)

[methods or similar for when you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m04s)

[do custom stuff but functionally it lets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m06s)

[you either focus on the back end uh and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m09s)

[how the the and do the data modeling and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m12s)

[figure out the relationships there or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m15s)

[the front end of you know making it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m16s)

[pretty figuring out the UI UX and not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m18s)

[stressing too much about the middle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m20s)

[stuff in between so if that sounds cool](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m22s)

[to you check it out there is also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m25s)

[there's a pretty slick site for it too](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m27s)

[anybody who wants it um I also have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m30s)

[been a number of people that have worked](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m41s)

[on it over the years but um those two I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m42s)

[think are are generally considered the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m45s)

[the big brains on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m47s)

[it uh okay so I want this as my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m49s)

[input to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m55s)

[create quest and we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m57s)

[take a quick look here and then I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m59s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m03s)

[need probably going to need both of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m04s)

[these and this is where we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m06s)

[end up having to do a little bit of of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m07s)

[fun stuff because I want to gen this not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m10s)

[too unlike how I did the I'm leaving the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m14s)

[clock the time provider for the clock in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m16s)

[here because I know I'm going to need it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m18s)

[very similar because this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m21s)

[not too unlike how we gen the API keys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m23s)

[except for you know this won't be an API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m26s)

[key so this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m28s)

[a partner coupon code oh man I just want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m31s)

[to rename it i'm going to do it right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m34s)

[now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m36s)

[partner promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m39s)

[code well is coupon code right because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m47s)

[in the database it's not it's not the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m50s)

[promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m52s)

[itself it's not actually that it's it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m55s)

[going to end up being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m58s)

[a you know promote coupon code might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m01s)

[right because this re this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m03s)

[be the information about the coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m05s)

[that's used to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m07s)

[generate the promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m12s)

[code yeah I think we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m16s)

[I think I think coupon code's going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m20s)

[be fine we're going to go with that uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m22s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m24s)

[uh uh coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m27s)

[code and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m31s)

[need Hey Aerys thank you for the follow](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m36s)

[i appreciate it let's see so we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m38s)

[to go with request name is that's just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m41s)

[going to be an arbitrary string where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m44s)

[you can like list the partner or the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m47s)

[promo or something about the coupon or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m48s)

[whatever and then this is where we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m51s)

[going to need to separate some stuff is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m52s)

[I want some of this API key](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m54s)

[stuff um but I want it but I don't want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m57s)

[like I need it out of this thingy bober](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m01s)

[we're not setting expiration dates on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m04s)

[these that's another key difference here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m06s)

[and we're not linking them out and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m08s)

[this is going to be the Stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m12s)

[ID request stripe coupon ID okay so this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m14s)

[is going to get me to here and this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m17s)

[going to get me to partner coupon codes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m19s)

[we might just go fix the database here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m21s)

[in a second because this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m22s)

[this is going to bother me having this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m24s)

[called well if this makes sense for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m26s)

[partner coupon code this also makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m28s)

[sense for partner coupon never mind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m30s)

[we're not going to change it it's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m31s)

[to be great it's going to be perfectly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m32s)

[great okay and then this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m34s)

[uh this is the details to route to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m42s)

[somewhere else uh we can't oh that's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m46s)

[wrong button that is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m50s)

[wrong okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m53s)

[what what what is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m57s)

[on shift down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m02s)

[arrow has started moving this wait how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m06s)

[do I do my block edit then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m10s)

[windows that moves line shift alt okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m15s)

[shift alt okay I was very confused for a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m18s)

[moment there we go block edits we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m21s)

[good okay so we need to move this API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m23s)

[key generate function this needs to live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m27s)

[somewhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m29s)

[else why did I think I needed the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m30s)

[clock thought I needed it in here for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m34s)

[something but I guess not okay so we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m37s)

[going to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m40s)

[we'll drop you as a parameter and this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m42s)

[is the other nice part about the minimal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m44s)

[API is it figures it out right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m45s)

[so there's a handful of things that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m49s)

[just knows how to populate for you so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m51s)

[like the DB context because it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m55s)

[obviously not going to find that on like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m57s)

[the body or the route it go it knows to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m59s)

[go oh I'll grab that from your DI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m02s)

[container and I'll populate that for you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m03s)

[cancellation token this is something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m05s)

[that comes through from the middleware](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m06s)

[in case the uh upstream call gets uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m08s)

[terminated there's your token done this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m10s)

[comes in on the body](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m14s)

[done easy mode easy easy easy mode okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m16s)

[um and then this guy here on the create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m21s)

[this is going to be create route and we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m25s)

[kind of need to go build out the the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m29s)

[get first before we before we get too](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m32s)

[carried away because this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m35s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m37s)

[maybe we go build this guy out and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m39s)

[come back so that's probably what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m42s)

[should do next so let's do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m44s)

[that uh get API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m46s)

[key going to look similar to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m49s)

[this so get partner is going to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m53s)

[real similar to get API key um and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m58s)

[then the question comes I think we don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m01s)

[return anything](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m05s)

[different here on a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m07s)

[single just return the singular one that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m10s)

[makes me question the difference between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m13s)

[having both of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m15s)

[these we're going to we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m17s)

[it like that for now and we'll consider](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m18s)

[the differences later uh let's see and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m21s)

[it needs an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m24s)

[ID uh it's going to need a handful of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m25s)

[things so it's going to need most of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m28s)

[this right uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m30s)

[uh what did I call this partner ID so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m34s)

[it's important that this name here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m38s)

[you will get yelled at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m40s)

[um but in this case because the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m43s)

[uh this is the API key](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m47s)

[one up this one here uh this get partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m52s)

[this partner ID needs to match right in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m56s)

[order for it to to make it all the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m00s)

[into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m01s)

[here uh we aren't going to have a user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m03s)

[context but we do need a DB context and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m05s)

[we've got a token great great great](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m07s)

[great and then we're going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m10s)

[something similar to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m11s)

[this except](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m13s)

[for let's see we're going to have one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m20s)

[these and this is the beauty of using](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m24s)

[the strongly typed result ones is you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m26s)

[can't accidentally return the wrong](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m28s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m30s)

[anymore and then it's squawking at me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m31s)

[because uh actually I think what we can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m34s)

[just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m37s)

[do need to make sure we're hitting that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m41s)

[yeah so I can just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m44s)

[do rather than two array we can just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m49s)

[first or default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m52s)

[async partner promotion code and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m54s)

[this guy literally just becomes partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m58s)

[promotion code but this doesn't handle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m01s)

[the not found case right so that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m03s)

[that's no bueno so we got to handle that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m05s)

[as well because this is a first or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m07s)

[default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m09s)

[um we need a wear to make sure that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m10s)

[actually you get the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m14s)

[one actually we can get away with doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m18s)

[this here right because you Yeah you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m20s)

[take the predicate so we can rather than](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m23s)

[doing a wear we can just come down here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m25s)

[and go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m28s)

[um I actually like the way that reads](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m31s)

[better this feels more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m33s)

[SQLy right it feels It feels better to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m35s)

[me i think they probably generate the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m39s)

[same SQL but me again small table not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m41s)

[going to stress too much about it this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m46s)

[this order of operations feels nicer to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m47s)

[me okay so if uh partner promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m49s)

[is null type result not found done and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m54s)

[then sure you want to turn area yeah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m58s)

[fine we can that just looks so freaking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m00s)

[ugly like that looks ugly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m04s)

[guess it's not bad if we format it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m14s)

[properly right if we do that that looks](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m16s)

[tolerable yeah if null return not found](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m24s)

[otherwise okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m27s)

[response done now we can come up here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m28s)

[right so this is then going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m32s)

[partner promotion code right because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m35s)

[we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m37s)

[to populate this sucker this guy is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m41s)

[going to be unhappy that he doesn't have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m44s)

[everything set oh and this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m46s)

[be interesting we might need a separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m49s)

[one because we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m51s)

[return like this will return fine but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m52s)

[we've now lost the the API key that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m54s)

[generated that's no bueno and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m59s)

[uh do move API key generation i I would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m04s)

[like this generate function to not live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m11s)

[because right now it lives inside the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m13s)

[database model which is fineish except](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m15s)

[for I kind of want it used in two places](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m17s)

[which means it probably shouldn't live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m19s)

[in one of the places and then we go with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m21s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m25s)

[partner routes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m27s)

[um get partner and I'm realizing maybe I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m34s)

[should change these to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m37s)

[uh create partner i think we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m42s)

[change these to include](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m45s)

[uh promotion code i I think is the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m49s)

[we're going to go this This feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m52s)

[nicer let's see here if I go bing Oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m54s)

[what is it shift alt nope control alt i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m57s)

[never remember the multicursor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m02s)

[thing so control alt for those who care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m07s)

[paste there we go okay and then control](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m10s)

[alt we'll just abuse that nice little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m13s)

[thing again to put multiple cursors down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m15s)

[and then paste](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m18s)

[done there we go except for right there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m20s)

[that's not where we wanted one that that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m23s)

[doesn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m25s)

[count okay that that feels a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m26s)

[better this guy now needs the same same](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m28s)

[treatment there and then this one needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m31s)

[uh coupon code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m35s)

[ID and this needs to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m37s)

[be partner ID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m40s)

[and now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m45s)

[uh do include](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m47s)

[um API key because we need to we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m51s)

[show it somewhere right because this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m54s)

[the one place where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m56s)

[um API key actually propagates out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m59s)

[so we're going to need to need to add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m05s)

[in uh okay so we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m06s)

[get do delete](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m10s)

[and we'll go and add some stuff to all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m15s)

[this let's see we don't need user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m19s)

[context we are going to need uh partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m21s)

[ID as the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m24s)

[gooid is that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m26s)

[necessary and what do we return here no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m28s)

[content or not found that makes that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m32s)

[makes some good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m35s)

[sense aside from my typing skills don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m37s)

[make good sense and then this is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m40s)

[to I think functionally be exactly the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m42s)

[same well sort of there's some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m45s)

[permissions checks in here that don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m49s)

[make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m50s)

[sense and we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m52s)

[do let's see here partner ID and this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m55s)

[going to be partner uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m58s)

[see fun code and then we don't need any](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m04s)

[includes where ID singular](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m08s)

[default goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m12s)

[there we go partner coupon codes save](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m15s)

[save save no content response done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m19s)

[next is the update call where's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m23s)

[update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m25s)

[call hey Isoreur have a good one thank](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m27s)

[you for dropping in i appreciate it uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m30s)

[let's see we do not have an update built](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m33s)

[on this one we only support](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m36s)

[delete okay we'll just freehand it no we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m40s)

[won't we'll go copy it from I don't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m44s)

[probably Teams teams is a generally a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m46s)

[simplistic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m50s)

[one create update so it's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m51s)

[something akin to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m55s)

[this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m57s)

[so this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m00s)

[be partner ID this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m04s)

[be update partner request we need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m08s)

[we don't need that we don't need that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m12s)

[do need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m14s)

[okay okay and then functionally we do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m17s)

[something akin to this where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m20s)

[we do all the the interesting bits okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m24s)

[except for this is going to be nowhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m28s)

[nearly as detailed uh something else](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m31s)

[that's worth calling out is when I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m34s)

[register my database with EF Core I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m35s)

[explicitly register it as no tracking by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m38s)

[default um because the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m40s)

[the time I'm just reading and when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m44s)

[do tracked entities in EF um your DB](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m45s)

[context has to watch for property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m49s)

[changes to know hey if you call save](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m52s)

[changes I go and update the thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m55s)

[right so if you if you don't need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m58s)

[and you'll see some people do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m02s)

[opposite right they'll leave tracking on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m03s)

[by default and they'll do as no tracking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m05s)

[on the stuff where they don't care about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m07s)

[because there is a nice performance gain](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m08s)

[to be had if you tell EF F yeah no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m09s)

[tracking don't worry about this i don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m12s)

[need you to be watching it for updates](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m14s)

[it's like oh sweet less for me to do i'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m16s)

[cool with that and then you're off to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m19s)

[the races um in this case because we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m20s)

[about to um update it like this in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m22s)

[case it is somewhat important that we uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m26s)

[actually get this one correct so that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m29s)

[why we turn on the track and we don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m33s)

[care about any of the permission stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m35s)

[and then this is going to be I'm going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m38s)

[to just cheat here var and then see look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m40s)

[at that uh let's see coupon code goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m43s)

[like that as tracking singular default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m48s)

[async great and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m51s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m53s)

[here and then we're going to go here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m55s)

[then we're going to say I don't care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m58s)

[about any of this because I think that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m59s)

[all we put on the request was name right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m01s)

[yep that's the only thing we let them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m03s)

[edit is the name don't care about any of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m04s)

[this don't care about any of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m07s)

[boom boom boom boom boom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m09s)

[boom okay and then we need to return the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m12s)

[updated one when we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m15s)

[done sorry I'm missing something oh it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m24s)

[because we don't we haven't updated the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m27s)

[return type that's what's going on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m30s)

[so don't do we actually return problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m36s)

[oh we return problem in some of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m39s)

[cases i don't think we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m41s)

[it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m43s)

[here we can probably dial this sucker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m44s)

[down a little bit because I don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m47s)

[we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m49s)

[this we are going to need to return back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m51s)

[a partner promotion code in the case of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m55s)

[an update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m58s)

[so we will do that but we won't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m00s)

[need any of the interesting bits so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m05s)

[we'll just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m08s)

[that and there may be an argument that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m09s)

[and by maybe an argument I'm realizing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m12s)

[that the fact that I want to do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m14s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m16s)

[times means I should I should probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m19s)

[consider pulling this out the the there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m22s)

[is a very important difference between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m25s)

[so this select here right you'll note X](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m28s)

[in this case is in um EF core entity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m32s)

[instance and I am projecting it into my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m36s)

[Poco my C# object that's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m40s)

[returned out from the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m42s)

[right this select and this little bit of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m44s)

[logic here is not the same as this down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m47s)

[here right even even though they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m51s)

[about to look real bloody](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m53s)

[similar right and it's it's real happy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m56s)

[to So this new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m59s)

[right and this new are not the same and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m02s)

[the reason they are not the same is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m07s)

[because this select is inside of a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m09s)

[system link expression right so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m13s)

[going to get translated into SQL this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m16s)

[going to be C# code that is executed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m20s)

[so even though it looks like I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m23s)

[duplicating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m25s)

[code I guess I'm I Well this one's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m27s)

[to be different because it's going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m30s)

[include the API key so that one's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m31s)

[to that one's going to be something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m32s)

[slightly different right we'll do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m35s)

[instead just to get it compiling for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m37s)

[this is also the same expression](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m41s)

[so like I could do I could do two](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m43s)

[overloads one for the expression and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m46s)

[one for this but this one's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m49s)

[different don't know how I feel about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m53s)

[that because this one's actually going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m56s)

[to be a diff we're probably going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m58s)

[create a a details one that had includes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m59s)

[the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m02s)

[key so so this is actually not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m04s)

[duplicating any of the code above](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m08s)

[despite how similar it looks](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m10s)

[that's exciting i mean I guess](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m13s)

[technically it is duplicating this one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m14s)

[for now but this one's going to change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m16s)

[so but there is no there's no actual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m18s)

[duplication okay there's all of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m20s)

[that gets me in there that gets things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m24s)

[built up let's make sure we're compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m26s)

[and then let's go spin some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m27s)

[tests right i guess the other thing we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m31s)

[can do is I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m34s)

[can me find](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m35s)

[my Right i can kill that and then um if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m37s)

[we want to launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m41s)

[the we could go and make sure that this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m42s)

[thing actually spun correctly we can go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m44s)

[look at the swagger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m46s)

[doc all right so this guy fires up does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m50s)

[the things oh I I never went back to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m53s)

[um ASP.NET host so I called out inside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m57s)

[of here that I was doing this persistent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m00s)

[lifetime this is actually very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m02s)

[convenient so if you leave this off what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m05s)

[you will get is a uh a docker container](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m07s)

[with your SQL server and when you shut](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m12s)

[down your Aspire host it will shut down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m14s)

[the container and so unless you so when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m16s)

[you are spinning up SQL server inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m19s)

[a Docker container you have some choices](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m21s)

[to make um one you can buy you can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m23s)

[like a volume mount to give it some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m26s)

[persistent storage so that when your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m28s)

[database server shuts down your database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m30s)

[is not lost because if you do nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m32s)

[it's just ephemeral and every time that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m34s)

[container dies you lose everything and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m36s)

[you start over right maybe that's what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m38s)

[you want right like maybe you're doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m41s)

[some integration tests and wiping the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m42s)

[database is a good thing right that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m44s)

[could be a thing um so you can do a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m45s)

[volume mount to be able to to have some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m49s)

[persistence there and go back and forth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m51s)

[um the other thing you can do is you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m52s)

[set this lifetime and this effectively](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m54s)

[sets the container lifetime to say you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m56s)

[know what and I think the docs are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m58s)

[actually pretty good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m00s)

[um we'll jump in here right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m02s)

[uh so if the container doesn't exist it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m05s)

[will get created](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m09s)

[um the it will attempt to reuse it if uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m11s)

[if it can effectively and so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m15s)

[kind of the middle ground that I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m19s)

[decided I liked best is this will spin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m21s)

[up a brand new SQL server fresh clean](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m24s)

[state i can muck with it and as long as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m27s)

[I'm running locally and deb debugging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m30s)

[because remember I'm using this aspire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m32s)

[host for my local environment if I ever](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m33s)

[want to start over I just kill the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m36s)

[Docker container and poof I have a fresh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m38s)

[database all over again it is mildly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m41s)

[obnoxious if I have like a Windows](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m43s)

[update and I have to reboot in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m45s)

[middle or a Docker update and I have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m47s)

[restart Docker like that's annoying](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m48s)

[because it's like ah shoot maybe I'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m50s)

[delay that for a little bit because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m52s)

[know I don't want to blow my database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m54s)

[away yet so it's like well maybe I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m55s)

[should add a volume out maybe not i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m57s)

[don't know so uh those are the pros and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m59s)

[cons pick which one you like best so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m03s)

[it's it's all about what's more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m06s)

[important to you keeping the data around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m07s)

[or being able to go back to a clean](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m10s)

[state and in my case I like going back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m11s)

[to a clean state a lot and I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m13s)

[scripts that will repopulate testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m15s)

[data for me if I want it so it's like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m17s)

[can I can get my database receded very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m20s)

[easily that's not a problem and you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m22s)

[could write little database seeders and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m25s)

[that kind of thing too so it's like if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m26s)

[you've got easy ways of repopulating the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m28s)

[data going back to a clean state isn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m30s)

[always that bad right and I like that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m32s)

[middle ground of we'll leave the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m34s)

[container running that way as I'm you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m35s)

[know debug launch debug launch debug](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m36s)

[launch it it stays there and across](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m38s)

[debug sessions uh my data persists it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m42s)

[just doesn't persist if I kill the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m45s)

[container so I I have a very easy way of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m46s)

[resetting myself back if I want to okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m48s)

[uh I have no idea there it is where it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m53s)

[launched to so if I look at my admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m57s)

[and hit the swagger page what I should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m59s)

[see oh right we did all of that work and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m01s)

[we didn't bind anything so nothing shows](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m04s)

[up in the swagger endpoint see this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m06s)

[why we should test okay so not so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m07s)

[did nothing and it did nothing because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m11s)

[over here in my program CS I have done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m13s)

[nothing to bind any of it so yeah so all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m15s)

[of that is uh you garbage um I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m18s)

[know why I have that sitting around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m22s)

[let's get rid of that okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m23s)

[uh so if we look at the API service one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m26s)

[this guy here like if we look at team](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m30s)

[extensions right this map team endpoints](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m32s)

[right is only invoked by one place so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m34s)

[effectively I just have a bunch of calls](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m38s)

[here that shell out to each of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m40s)

[individual ones as needed so if we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m42s)

[back up here what that means is about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m44s)

[here we're going to do this and we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m48s)

[going to do map partner endpoints that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m50s)

[will get us to there we are then going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m54s)

[to kill](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m56s)

[off this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m58s)

[thing because I don't want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m00s)

[to I'm going to comment it because I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m04s)

[want to go and look up this verify has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m07s)

[accepted scope stuff because I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m09s)

[remember exactly how I need to set this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m10s)

[up we're going to we're going to just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m12s)

[kill that but now when I launch what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m14s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m16s)

[uh what is the front end written in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m17s)

[great question so the uh the front end](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m19s)

[for the website itself is React so if we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m22s)

[jump over here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m26s)

[uh clearly we have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m32s)

[problems uh let's see i should be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m35s)

[to hit my GitHub account](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m37s)

[here should just work yay so yeah so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m40s)

[this is the this is the React front end](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m44s)

[i think I have it set up for my local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m46s)

[environment](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m48s)

[it looks like I do yeah so that's that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m49s)

[where this one is sitting in um and it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m52s)

[the the front end for this um just with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m56s)

[my partner and the way we were splitting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m59s)

[up the work the front end is the only](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m01s)

[part of kind of the hosted solution that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m03s)

[lives outside of my backend repository](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m05s)

[so if you you'll note in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m08s)

[uh Aspire app host I've got kind of this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m12s)

[weird little directory thing that just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m16s)

[says "Hey let's go and look and see if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m18s)

[the front end is checked out right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m19s)

[alongside of us." And if it is great](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m21s)

[we're going to add another uh resource](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m23s)

[into our dashboard with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m25s)

[it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m26s)

[done so simple little way of bringing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m30s)

[in without doing a lot of work and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m35s)

[the key thing here is just kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m37s)

[um uh this little dirty check with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m40s)

[the API service and having this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m43s)

[reference flow through that way it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m46s)

[automatically u references back to my uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m48s)

[API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m54s)

[uh let's see uh Heisen uh hi Kevin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m56s)

[trying to get a reference to a canvas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m00s)

[that's inside an items panel uh of an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m01s)

[items control but it's not directly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m04s)

[accessible by name in the code beahheim](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m07s)

[right now I'm handling this by using the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m09s)

[loaded event of the canvas entering](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m11s)

[first in the visual tree items full](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m12s)

[border canvas and storing as a reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m15s)

[to it in a private field um I assigned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m17s)

[to a new dummy canvas beforehand but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m21s)

[this feels ugly is there a better way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m24s)

[um so probably let me let me sorry I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m29s)

[just want to read this one more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m33s)

[time so you have an items panel inside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m35s)

[of an items control and you're basically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m38s)

[looking to do I I'm guessing this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m40s)

[some sort of like drag dropy situation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m42s)

[where the canvas is the desirable panel](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m45s)

[because of its absolute positioning um I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m48s)

[am also Heisen I'm making an assumption](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m51s)

[this is WPF if that's wrong please](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m53s)

[correct me but this this I'm fairly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m55s)

[confident this WPF uh let's see so items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m57s)

[control border canvas and you want to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m01s)

[able to get access to the canvas by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m04s)

[name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m07s)

[uh so let's see here the items panel is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m10s)

[effectively a data template so it's not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m16s)

[populated right away](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m18s)

[is there a cleaner way to get at it than](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m24s)

[just parsing the visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m27s)

[tree because I I know we've done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m30s)

[this let me look real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m34s)

[quick sorry I was checking to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m39s)

[see vic.exe if you're there feel free to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m45s)

[chime in you've done this more recently](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m49s)

[than I have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m50s)

[um trying to think if there is a if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m53s)

[there is a cleaner solution because in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m55s)

[your items control you set the items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m58s)

[panel you set the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m02s)

[canvas you can't really get to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m03s)

[canvas via](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m06s)

[name which makes some sense because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m09s)

[said see Vic you're there so when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m13s)

[did this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m17s)

[before I think you went v I I think you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m18s)

[did something very similar where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m21s)

[watch for the loaded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m23s)

[event and then grab the canvas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m26s)

[though honestly if you're grabbing the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m31s)

[loaded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m34s)

[event I don't think you have to traverse](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m36s)

[the visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m38s)

[tree i'm not sure I needed a reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m40s)

[to it ah okay so you may have gotten](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m42s)

[around it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m45s)

[um yeah so there's there's a couple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m48s)

[options here that that you may be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m51s)

[to do so if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m53s)

[uh let me see do I have Okay detour time](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m56s)

[uh let me find an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m00s)

[appropriately scoped terminal window](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m03s)

[uh we're just going to jump uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m07s)

[make it WPF test right dd WPF](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m11s)

[testn net](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m17s)

[new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m20s)

[boom and we got a solution](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m28s)

[um so there there's a couple things that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m35s)

[may be worth consideration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m38s)

[sorry it's going to spend a hot second](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m42s)

[here while it figures itself out so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m44s)

[you've got something that looks akin to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m46s)

[this right so items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m48s)

[control items control uh items panel and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m51s)

[then you've got some sort of uh items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m56s)

[panel template right and then we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m00s)

[the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m02s)

[canvas boom so you've got you've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m03s)

[something akin to this and you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m05s)

[be able to grab a hold of this canvas to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m07s)

[be able to do uh useful stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m09s)

[so a few things like if you're if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m14s)

[already watching the loaded event right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m17s)

[and you do something like this in your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m20s)

[code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m22s)

[behind so canvas C](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m25s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m30s)

[canvas sender right like you can grab it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m33s)

[you can grab it as simply as this to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m36s)

[able to cache it and if you're if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m38s)

[are just looking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m41s)

[to hold on to it because you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m43s)

[register on up um mouse events and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m46s)

[similar on there the other thing you So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m49s)

[this will get you a a reference that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m52s)

[could do and it it'll save you at least](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m54s)

[the parsing of the visual tree which I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m56s)

[kind of like a little bit better and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m58s)

[this might be why you didn't need a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m00s)

[direct reference to it Bick because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m02s)

[the other thing you can do is if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m05s)

[wanting to register up mouse events I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m07s)

[trying to remember](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m10s)

[is like is this not Let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m13s)

[uh background transparent like I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m17s)

[wondering if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m20s)

[actually need to grab it or if you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m22s)

[just register the event straight up on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m25s)

[it so we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m27s)

[to we're going to just do that for a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m30s)

[second because I think you can just grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m33s)

[it i I think you can avoid needing a a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m35s)

[hard reference to it and just register](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m38s)

[the event handlers to your codebind the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m41s)

[other thing that may be worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m43s)

[consideration is a behavior because a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m45s)

[behavior is a nice way of attaching code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m47s)

[behind stuff so if I do this yeah a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m50s)

[mouse down event comes right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m53s)

[through yeah so you may be able So I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m01s)

[guess I would be curious to see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m06s)

[um yeah I I think I I think you might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m12s)

[able to get away without needing to to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m15s)

[store the if all you're doing is adding](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m17s)

[event handlers to your canvas i think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m19s)

[you can just register event handlers](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m21s)

[directly on this because then the um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m23s)

[these events are are wired up for you as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m27s)

[part of this initialize component i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m30s)

[don't know if it'll let me in uh yeah so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m32s)

[it's going to be hidden away in the load](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m35s)

[component but it the initialize](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m36s)

[component handles registering those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m38s)

[things for you because it knows when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m39s)

[it's injected um the appropriate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m41s)

[instance for that canvas and so these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m44s)

[things then get built up and you're off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m47s)

[to the races right so down here in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m48s)

[connect after it's done all of this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m52s)

[fancy stuff this is always a fun one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m54s)

[line number 29](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m56s)

[um which pro tip this is an awesome](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m58s)

[trick if people haven't seen this before](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m02s)

[it's very rarely used in your own code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m04s)

[and mostly used in generators but if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m05s)

[want to lie to the debugger about where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m08s)

[it should be this is how you can do it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m10s)

[pound line file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m13s)

[reference and the debugger will just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m16s)

[happily move the execution pointer there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m18s)

[it's really fun again this is done just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m21s)

[so that the debugger goes "Oh okay this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m24s)

[loaded thing is actually line 29 in main](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m27s)

[window.zaml because this is functionally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m31s)

[where the developer wrote it." But it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m33s)

[like well it's not actually there it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m34s)

[it's it's actually over here so you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m36s)

[you can do that kind of stuff so yeah um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m38s)

[give that a shot Heisen and see i think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m41s)

[in most cases if you just register the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m45s)

[event handlers you'll then be good if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m47s)

[you do need to cache it for something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m49s)

[else I would I would just grab it like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m53s)

[this i think this is probably the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m56s)

[easiest way to do it because then you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m58s)

[don't have to think as hard um but if if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m00s)

[the if the behavior that you need can be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m03s)

[kind of wrapped up and contained um a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m05s)

[behavior is not a bad idea either right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m08s)

[so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m11s)

[um so you end up referencing the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m14s)

[interactivity bits](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m17s)

[uh ZAML behaviors](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m22s)

[wiki yeah so this this is the community](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m25s)

[toolkits docs but they they shell out to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m28s)

[the other ones and their docs are fairly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m30s)

[good because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m32s)

[they they're they're using the same uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m33s)

[base class they've just come with a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m37s)

[of built-in ones](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m38s)

[um but a behavior is often a nice way of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m41s)

[wrapping up the code behind stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m45s)

[because it gives you an attach detach](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m47s)

[method and one of the properties is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m49s)

[associated element which in your case if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m51s)

[you attach the behavior to the canvas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m54s)

[you then have this class with an attach](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m56s)

[detach where you can register up to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m59s)

[events and everything to your heart's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m01s)

[content the the only thing with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m03s)

[behaviors though that you have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m04s)

[remember is they're they're designed to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m05s)

[be kind of encapsulated code behind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m07s)

[units um that are technically reusable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m09s)

[that you can drop into other places so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m12s)

[it may be overkill if you're never going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m14s)

[to reuse it but it is a nice way of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m16s)

[getting yourself code behind onto a ZAML](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m18s)

[element that might not otherwise have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m21s)

[code behind so for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m22s)

[example this guy here like a resource](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m24s)

[dictionary by default doesn't have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m27s)

[code behind file and so you can either](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m28s)

[make a resource dictionary have a code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m31s)

[behind file or you can just attach a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m33s)

[behavior to the element inside the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m35s)

[resource dictionary and kind of get that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m37s)

[same type of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m39s)

[behavior so it it depends a little bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m40s)

[on what you're doing but something of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m43s)

[that nature perhaps but yeah give that a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m44s)

[shot see how that works good question](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m47s)

[though love questions so if anybody if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m51s)

[anybody has stuff like I always come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m55s)

[into these streams with an idea of what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m57s)

[I'm going to work on but I am I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m58s)

[always happy to uh to rabbit trail if if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m02s)

[that it's going to matter that much okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m00s)

[so we need to do a handful of things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m02s)

[first of all nuke all that crap](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m08s)

[next we probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m10s)

[want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m14s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m15s)

[here we do not need the global using](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m17s)

[that's handled i've got like my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m21s)

[directory build props is quite](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m23s)

[extensive so I do a lot of stuff to just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m26s)

[make it all work nicely for me so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m29s)

[don't have to think real hard um okay so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m31s)

[there that gets me to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m33s)

[there let's see we need a project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m35s)

[reference to the project we want to test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m37s)

[that makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m39s)

[sense add that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m41s)

[done and then I guess we'll do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m44s)

[fluent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m47s)

[analyzers uh I'm kind of trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m49s)

[decide why that isn't up here and not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m52s)

[anywhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m56s)

[else because the package reference lives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m59s)

[here so I think I can put this here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m01s)

[then just kill this off i don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m03s)

[this needs to exist](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m05s)

[okay there make that a little simpler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m08s)

[for all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m10s)

[involved i'm I'm going to just while I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m13s)

[doing this go kill all of these things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m17s)

[off because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m22s)

[moved all of these things off you could](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m25s)

[probably just change it in one place](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m29s)

[there too](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m31s)

[but there all of that out um the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m36s)

[thing that I've done is I've actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m40s)

[pinned Fluent Assertions back to an a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m42s)

[slightly older version where it uh is no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m44s)

[longer dealing with their updated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m48s)

[licensing stuff so just because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m49s)

[decided to do that to give me time to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m53s)

[think about what I actually want to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m56s)

[long term jc good morning welcome](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m57s)

[welcome welcome we are having fun in web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m59s)

[API land and packac it's very exciting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m03s)

[we are building an admin API so that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m07s)

[can generate promotion codes for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m09s)

[coupons i know it's very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m12s)

[exciting it's exciting for me uh because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m15s)

[I enjoy building this stuff okay so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m18s)

[gets me all the way to there that gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m20s)

[me to there i got my band symbols going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m22s)

[that's this is for people who haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m25s)

[seen this this is if you want to annoy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m28s)

[your colleagues this is this is how you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m30s)

[do it um let's see i think it's actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m33s)

[all the way top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m36s)

[level we build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m38s)

[props no where where is the package in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m40s)

[here there's the band API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m44s)

[analyzer yeah so this Microsoft code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m49s)

[analysis band API analyzers this is one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m52s)

[of the coolest ones i love this thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m56s)

[this This is This is when you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m59s)

[annoy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m01s)

[people um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m02s)

[uh I think the docs for it are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m07s)

[here uh let's see let's just hunt band i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m13s)

[think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m16s)

[it's I think it's in here uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m17s)

[do not use band APIs blah blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m21s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m24s)

[blah meant disposable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m25s)

[correctly yeah they're they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m28s)

[referencing it in here short version you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m30s)

[bring in this band API analyzer for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m33s)

[anybody who wants to play along at home](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m35s)

[and then you can create this band](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m38s)

[symbols.txt file at the root of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m40s)

[project and anything that it finds in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m42s)

[here it just straight up like it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m47s)

[generate uh a build warning that you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m50s)

[then elevate to an air if you'd like so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m53s)

[you can just straight ban APIs of please](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m55s)

[do not use this ever so for example I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m00s)

[have banned the usage of calling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m03s)

[datetime offset now and UTC now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m05s)

[specifically and I leave a nice little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m08s)

[message of hey if you're trying to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m11s)

[this here's the alternative right use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m13s)

[the new time provider API that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m15s)

[included in net 9 right like go do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m18s)

[so it's a way of kicking people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m21s)

[and it's like when you want to flag a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m25s)

[method as obsolete but the method isn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m28s)

[yours this is how you can do it so fun](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m30s)

[tricks fun tricks and it keeps future](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m34s)

[Kevin from doing something that current](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m37s)

[Kevin doesn't like that's that's that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m39s)

[also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m42s)

[important okay so I want to do a couple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m43s)

[things and I want to do one of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m46s)

[tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m50s)

[immediately we're going to come up here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m51s)

[and we're going to paste](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m52s)

[this because we're going to get this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m55s)

[going so the the idea here is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m57s)

[that this should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m04s)

[um I I want to effectively snapshot uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m06s)

[test into uh to make sure that my API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m11s)

[doesn't change without me knowing about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m15s)

[it does that need to go into material](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m16s)

[design and ZAML](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m18s)

[uh that's a good question JC maybe the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m20s)

[only thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m24s)

[that's I might think on that because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m26s)

[like I said it is a great analyzer for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m28s)

[annoying people and I try to keep the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m30s)

[bar for entry on material design and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m32s)

[ZAML as low as is I think reasonable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m34s)

[like I don't elevate warnings as errors](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m37s)

[locally but I do elevate them on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m41s)

[pipeline so it's like people who want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m43s)

[just kind of clone and play around with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m45s)

[the repository I don't want them to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m47s)

[to fight with it to get it going um and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m48s)

[then but I do bump warnings as there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m51s)

[up on the pipeline so if you get to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m54s)

[point of submitting a PR at that point](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m55s)

[it's like well now we kind of got to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m57s)

[actually like fix stuff like I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m58s)

[people to download and clone and and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m00s)

[play without feeling like they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m02s)

[fighting with the tooling because it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m03s)

[like if somebody just clones and wants](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m05s)

[to play around locally I don't care what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m06s)

[they do i only care when it merges back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m08s)

[like and I care a little bit um but yeah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m11s)

[it may think on that it it may be worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m15s)

[doing at some point um just to kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m19s)

[strongly hit to people the one thing I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m22s)

[really want is I want an equivalent for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m25s)

[it for ZAML like I want ZAML analyzers](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m26s)

[like we've got C# analyzers now i want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m30s)

[it for my ZAML like I also want source](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m32s)

[generators for my ZAML that would be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m34s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m36s)

[too uh who wins the battle between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m37s)

[future and past](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m40s)

[Kevin well current Kevin always wins](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m41s)

[past Kevin is generally considered to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m45s)

[an idiot and future Kevin just makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m47s)

[mistakes so current Kevin's always best](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m50s)

[but I think I take future Kevin over](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m53s)

[past Kevin past Kevin didn't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m54s)

[anything i think that's that that's I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m57s)

[think the general way of how that works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m59s)

[okay so web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m01s)

[factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m03s)

[uh boy I am going to want to move some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m07s)

[of this into a shared place where I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m10s)

[play with it um but this class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m12s)

[here so we're going to copy this thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m18s)

[over and then we're going to figure out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m21s)

[what we need to keep and what we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m23s)

[change so step one what we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m26s)

[change is the name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m28s)

[space that needs to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m29s)

[immediately okay and now this guy here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m33s)

[this is the other this is the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m37s)

[thing and I was wondering if I was going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m40s)

[to get bit by this but I didn't know how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m42s)

[the other one worked so you'll note it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m44s)

[wants to reference a program but I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m47s)

[the program class to be public how did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m49s)

[make it public oh that's what I did like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m52s)

[how did I make it public so when you use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m56s)

[a um top level statement so like all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m58s)

[this what is that was that garbage um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m03s)

[this all gets put into a generated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m07s)

[program class with a main method and all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m09s)

[that it's great it's wonderful the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m11s)

[problem is the uh the program class gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m12s)

[generated um as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m16s)

[class program technically it gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m20s)

[generated partial class program but the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m23s)

[default access modifier for classes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m27s)

[without anything specified is internal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m30s)

[which means you can't touch it from your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m32s)

[unit test project so the dirty little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m34s)

[trick is you come down here and you go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m37s)

[you know what I'm going to declare](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m38s)

[another part of that partial and I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m40s)

[going to put an access modifier on it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m42s)

[that's public so boom done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m43s)

[it's one of those areas of C where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m49s)

[have to know the internals of how it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m51s)

[works in order to like use it well it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m53s)

[it's very unfortunate i think in an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m57s)

[ideal situation people wouldn't have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m59s)

[know the internals to leverage it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m01s)

[effectively but in this case that's just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m03s)

[unfortunately a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m06s)

[effect uh comment required](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m12s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m15s)

[probably this uh changes the default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m17s)

[access](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m23s)

[modifier of the program class to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m25s)

[public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m27s)

[for testing with web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m29s)

[factory probably a good call out okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m38s)

[we're going to get rid of that for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m40s)

[until I know that I need it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m41s)

[okay we have serialization which we need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m44s)

[we have SQLite which we need i So I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m48s)

[looking at this from the perspective of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m51s)

[I think some of this is about to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m53s)

[into a base class that I can reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m56s)

[in both my test projects because I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m58s)

[I'm going to end up wanting a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m01s)

[this i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m06s)

[think now I'm obviously going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m09s)

[this this isn't going to be right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m12s)

[because this is setting up um claims on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m14s)

[uh a user that's expected to look like a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m18s)

[B2C user whereas in this case I want it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m21s)

[to look like an admin user so that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m23s)

[going to be very different um we don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m25s)

[need any of these we don't need any of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m29s)

[these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m33s)

[i do like the idea of having the Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m35s)

[service simulator so where does that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m39s)

[live because we do have a shared testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m42s)

[repository where we can move some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m46s)

[this down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m48s)

[but I'm wondering if maybe what I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m54s)

[is a service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m56s)

[test to hold the to hold the shared bits](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m58s)

[because the the stripe service lives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m02s)

[inside a service core and so I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m05s)

[thinking an equivalent there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m07s)

[probably apt um the xunit logging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m10s)

[provider where is that why is that not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m13s)

[in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m15s)

[shared Why are you not in my shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m16s)

[stuff you should absolutely be in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m19s)

[shared stuff yeah I don't know why this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m21s)

[one's not so that's just in a bad place](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m24s)

[pull you out put you in the Because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m27s)

[should probably be underneath my XUnit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m30s)

[folder that would make a lot more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m34s)

[sense change namespace make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m36s)

[public you should be accessible you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m40s)

[stay internal I believe same with you i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m44s)

[don't think either of you need to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m47s)

[exposed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m48s)

[until such a time as I see a reason](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m49s)

[to um let's build this project and see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m54s)

[if anything broke hopefully the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m58s)

[namespace refactor just worked of course](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m01s)

[not that would Oh this is Hold](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m05s)

[on uh let's see admin one I don't care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m09s)

[about this one I care about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m12s)

[extent login provider couldn't be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m17s)

[found include that okay so that'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m19s)

[fix that'll fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m23s)

[that um but I do think I'm going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m26s)

[a base web application factory because a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m28s)

[good chunk of this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m30s)

[is going to straight get reused so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m32s)

[think we're going to leverage that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m35s)

[should now be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m37s)

[referencable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m40s)

[um yeah and then this we are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m43s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m48s)

[keep i just do this register the default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m49s)

[authentication scheme so we can do faked](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m53s)

[users add authorization policies great i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m57s)

[don't think I care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m02s)

[about email client mocking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m05s)

[not until there is such a time as I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m10s)

[it the authentication stuff is used](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m13s)

[that's used this is all the test off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m16s)

[handler stuff so what's left so the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m19s)

[stripe service stuff needs to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m21s)

[probably moved into a sh I think I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m24s)

[going to create a project just to hold](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m26s)

[those references um what is leped in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m28s)

[here what else is tightly coupled](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m32s)

[because this is getting close to being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m35s)

[an uncoupled thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m36s)

[what am I missing where's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m39s)

[red oh there it is oh so the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m41s)

[authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m45s)

[schemes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m50s)

[this probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m53s)

[moves because we're going to need HMAC](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m57s)

[in more than one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m59s)

[place so I think we probably move this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m02s)

[into the service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m05s)

[let's look at that first of all so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m09s)

[think is Omac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m12s)

[um this was the authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m16s)

[helper authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m19s)

[options i see no reason why this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m22s)

[shouldn't move into service core because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m25s)

[we're going to need it in multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m29s)

[places so that seems to be a good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m30s)

[argument to move it let's give oursel an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m32s)

[o name space here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m35s)

[medication options](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m37s)

[cut paste and I have fairly good test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m39s)

[coverage over this whole area so if it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m43s)

[seems like I'm making changes kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m47s)

[willy-nilly it's because I'm real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m48s)

[confident that if my tests pass that I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m50s)

[in that I'm in good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m54s)

[shape why do I have sche and schema](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m56s)

[i don't understand why this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m13s)

[exists unless I'm missing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m21s)

[something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m24s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m25s)

[um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m28s)

[yeah this can just be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m30s)

[that I think that's slightly more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m38s)

[obvious too of what's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m41s)

[on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m43s)

[um where's that options coming](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m46s)

[from oh it was passed down it was being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m50s)

[passed in from the base yeah I think I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m53s)

[like just being explicit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m57s)

[that wasn't overriding anything from the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m01s)

[base was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m02s)

[it no these are both legitimately just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m04s)

[at this level i don't think there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m08s)

[anything in the base that references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m11s)

[it nope](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m14s)

[okay so we're going to go with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m17s)

[deletion and we moved him down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m20s)

[and we changed his reference and that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m24s)

[should now work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m28s)

[we'll see about moving more in a minute](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m30s)

[but for now that gets that should get us](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m32s)

[compiling okay because we'll pro we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m37s)

[we'll almost assuredly need more here in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m39s)

[a bit but what I'm looking for is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m41s)

[thing is looking real close to what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m43s)

[would consider a good base class for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m45s)

[what I'm going to want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m48s)

[so I think we're going to just yank this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m50s)

[sucker out genericize him](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m53s)

[and be in a pretty good place for most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m57s)

[of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m01s)

[this okay so let's go and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m03s)

[take this web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m09s)

[class and let's move him](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m12s)

[into oh shortcut for removing using so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m15s)

[am doing uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m19s)

[controlrg uh but if you come up to I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m21s)

[believe it's under edit and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m24s)

[advanced and where is it it's remove and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m28s)

[sort](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m31s)

[using could have sworn it was in here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m34s)

[refactor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m38s)

[no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m42s)

[aligning refer to lines](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m46s)

[instances okay if we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m50s)

[search remove and sort using edit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m53s)

[intellisense remove and sort using edit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m56s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m00s)

[intellisense remove and sort using so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m01s)

[control I don't know why mine isn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m04s)

[showing the the shortcut here but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m05s)

[believe the default visual studio is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m08s)

[controlr](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m09s)

[um I used to actually do alt e i and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m11s)

[then uh it used to be o a but now it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m16s)

[alt E I E so E I E I O except for you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m21s)

[will get you will get you there as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m40s)

[well okay so web application factory i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m42s)

[think we are going to copy this into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m45s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m47s)

[right because there's nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h08m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m24s)

[uh let's do this so add new project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m26s)

[let's add a class library](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m30s)

[next because we're we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m32s)

[it in both cases anyway](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m34s)

[uh oh yeah no that's a good point the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m37s)

[cleanup profiles so the Where are those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m40s)

[things um you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m51s)

[uh configure code cleanup and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m55s)

[there's the two run code cleanup so in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m57s)

[the configure code cleanup you can add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m59s)

[in whatever you want here and I've seen](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m02s)

[people do this quite a bit where they've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m05s)

[got multiple profiles for like remove](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m06s)

[unnecessary and sort using you can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m08s)

[auto formats this is often times](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m10s)

[a very nice way usually people's biggest](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m14s)

[complaint is there's not enough fixers](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m17s)

[in here for everything they want to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m19s)

[but it does get you it does get you a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m21s)

[fairly reasonable thing i've always I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m23s)

[it and some people get twitchy about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m31s)

[doing it consistently but it's yeah for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m33s)

[for people who want to continue these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m36s)

[because you can do the is it tools](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m38s)

[options I think and then if you do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m41s)

[uh code cleanup here uh and so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m46s)

[the this is the option here for run code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m49s)

[cleanup profile and save and you can see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m52s)

[you've got multiple profiles to pick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m54s)

[from and And then there's the link to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m56s)

[get into that same screen so no good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m57s)

[call out there thank you um okay sorry](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m00s)

[add new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m05s)

[project class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m07s)

[library and then we're going to go and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m12s)

[test and then we the the hard part is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m14s)

[going to be the naming of this so it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m16s)

[going to be bell](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m17s)

[pack i think if I just call it service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m19s)

[core testing because you'll note there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m23s)

[a subtle difference I've done in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m25s)

[naming testing is the libraries test is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m27s)

[the unit test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m30s)

[project and I think I think we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m35s)

[to go like that i I think that makes it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m38s)

[better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m41s)

[because and then let's clean you up so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m43s)

[you don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m47s)

[suck okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m48s)

[so you'll know like my band symbols is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m51s)

[already showing up it's because my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m52s)

[directory build props is doing is doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m54s)

[some heavy lifting for me so I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m56s)

[what I want to do is I would like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m58s)

[copy you into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m00s)

[here okay and then the question is what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m05s)

[do I need so I need MVC testing brought](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m08s)

[into here that's a given i'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m12s)

[need SQL light both of those are a given](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m14s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m18s)

[um because this is the whole point of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m20s)

[this separate thing is because I need a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m22s)

[separate set of dependencies that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m24s)

[don't necessarily want to share](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m26s)

[elsewhere so and then this thing was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m29s)

[picking up the jot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m32s)

[bearer where was that making it in from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m35s)

[it must be Oh it's coming in because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m39s)

[referencing the API project and so it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m42s)

[probably a transitive dependency](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m45s)

[that but I don't want this thing to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m48s)

[to reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m51s)

[uh an API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m52s)

[project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m55s)

[so what I really want is this and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m56s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m00s)

[understand](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m01s)

[why the project generator added these in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m02s)

[thank you i will add my own no warns](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m05s)

[thank you very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m09s)

[much um I appreciate you trying to help](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m10s)

[me but knock it off let's see and then I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m12s)

[intrinsically like to try to sort these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m17s)

[things because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m19s)

[weird i I just I I feel better when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m22s)

[things are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m25s)

[in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m27s)

[order](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m29s)

[yeah i don't know for some reason that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m31s)

[that that makes me feel good um what can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m33s)

[I say i'm weird uh so web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m36s)

[of T program and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m39s)

[T](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m46s)

[program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m48s)

[and just to avoid naming collisions](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m53s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m56s)

[this just so it's real clear what we've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m57s)

[done okay so now it wants generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m03s)

[constraint go ahead and add the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m08s)

[constraint for me where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m10s)

[the none of those are at the generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m14s)

[constraint fine where t program derives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m17s)

[class happy there we go okay so that has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m20s)

[effectively almost everything in it that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m26s)

[I think should occur by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m29s)

[default we got to deal with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m31s)

[configure services from the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m33s)

[one authenticate async](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m37s)

[Um so this needs to be changed up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m43s)

[because I need all of the references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m48s)

[that were closing before to not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m50s)

[be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m54s)

[closing so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m56s)

[there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m01s)

[there and then how many more references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m06s)

[do we have just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m09s)

[those okay so it's just those so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m11s)

[should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m13s)

[make you are now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m15s)

[referenced that That feels better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m19s)

[because now now it actually figures out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m21s)

[how to do it it's what we want it's got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m23s)

[all of the the logging stuff it's got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m26s)

[the user context stuff we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m28s)

[break you out into your own](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m30s)

[file that makes me feel a little more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m32s)

[warm and fuzzy there and then more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m35s)

[importantly once we're inside of here I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m38s)

[think we're going to add a project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m41s)

[reference to service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m42s)

[core and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m45s)

[I think what we're going to do is we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m48s)

[going to grab that stripe service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m52s)

[simulator because before I was putting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m55s)

[all of my simulators](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m58s)

[here but I don't think I want that so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m00s)

[I'm going to cut](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m03s)

[you go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m06s)

[here go add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m08s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m11s)

[simulator uh it was simulators wasn't it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m13s)

[yeah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m16s)

[there's a general idea that when you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m18s)

[naming namespaces it's often best to use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m20s)

[a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m23s)

[plural only because when you name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m24s)

[namespaces in a plural you don't run](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m27s)

[into the the collision when you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m30s)

[have a class of the same name right like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m33s)

[it's not uncommon to run into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m36s)

[situation where the the last bit of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m38s)

[namespace often times there's a class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m40s)

[inside of it that you want to match and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m43s)

[that will cause you no end of problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m45s)

[and so if your name spaces have a plural](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m49s)

[on the end you just kind of subtly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m51s)

[sidestep that whole issue and it becomes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m52s)

[less uh of an issue](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m56s)

[okay so that that gets me into there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m00s)

[which means this guy here should now be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m03s)

[able to reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m05s)

[that oh once I change you over to be in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m09s)

[the right name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m13s)

[space there we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m15s)

[and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m18s)

[then and you should be able to get a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m24s)

[reference to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m27s)

[that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m29s)

[and can we not I think in this case we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m34s)

[can just reference the simulator's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m37s)

[namespace directly i think the other one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m39s)

[wasn't able to do it because it ran a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m41s)

[mug oh no that's why because grumble](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m43s)

[grumble grumble grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m47s)

[um kind of want to clear that off though](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m52s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m56s)

[using fellow pack service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m59s)

[core core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m03s)

[testing I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m12s)

[wrong oh it's because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m18s)

[Oh fine fine we'll just do this fully](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m21s)

[qualified and call it a day oh I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m25s)

[have to fight it let's see uh in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m27s)

[community tool MVVM when using](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m28s)

[observable property is it true that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m30s)

[cannot modify the value being assigned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m32s)

[to a property with the on property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m35s)

[changing partial method unlike a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m37s)

[traditional property setter where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m39s)

[can adjust the value uh before it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m41s)

[stored yes that is correct inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m44s)

[the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m49s)

[so main window view model if we open](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m51s)

[this guy up and look at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m54s)

[analyzer because you'll see count is one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m56s)

[there if we look at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m59s)

[uh community toolkit source generators](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m04s)

[and then we look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m06s)

[at property on backing field why do you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m08s)

[not show me the generated code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m11s)

[come on show it to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m15s)

[me i know you have it in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m17s)

[there uh am I Oh is it this one property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m20s)

[generator there it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m25s)

[so if we look at what actually gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m27s)

[generated for it you'll note here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m29s)

[the the on property changing right that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m33s)

[that ends up uh getting invoked and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m38s)

[value changed like nothing is assigning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m41s)

[back to value or passing by ref value in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m44s)

[so if you're trying to leverage like one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m48s)

[of these uh changing methods it ends up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m50s)

[doing nothing the only thing you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m54s)

[technically do and you want to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m57s)

[slightly more careful in doing this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m59s)

[there's nothing stopping you from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m02s)

[calling the setter of of your property a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m04s)

[second time right so what I mean is if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m06s)

[you do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m09s)

[uh partial uh on count uh changing right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m11s)

[like there's nothing stopping you from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m16s)

[saying oh actually I want count to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m18s)

[new value + one now do not do this this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m21s)

[will cause a stack](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m24s)

[overflow because now inside of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m26s)

[setter I have recalled the setter with a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m28s)

[new value that's always going to keep](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m30s)

[coming like the only way this works is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m32s)

[if you have something like if count you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m34s)

[know uh less than 10 right like this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m38s)

[needs to be conditionally done right and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m41s)

[so that you don't end up in a in an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m44s)

[infinite loop right of going through and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m47s)

[do but yes it is true that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m49s)

[cannot you cannot j You cannot mutate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m52s)

[this value as part of it going all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m55s)

[way through again you can do something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m57s)

[like this but do it with caution right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m58s)

[because I have I have shot myself in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m01s)

[foot many a time um doing this uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m03s)

[oftentimes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m08s)

[if if you can a slightly uh what I will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m10s)

[often do instead is just give myself a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m14s)

[function that does whatever calculation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m17s)

[I want to do on the way in and have it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m20s)

[be the thing that calls my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m22s)

[setter right rather than trying to do it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m25s)

[as part of the setter um that's one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m27s)

[option the other thing you can do is you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m30s)

[can always you don't have to always use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m33s)

[the observable property um attribute](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m36s)

[could set the vacuum field](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m40s)

[unchanged you could right like that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m42s)

[another option right like you could come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m45s)

[through here and do this now obviously](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m46s)

[this is in the changing method so this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m48s)

[value gets overwritten right and it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m51s)

[going to the MVVM toolkit analyzer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m53s)

[throws warnings at you but you could do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m57s)

[changed right because uh again if we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m58s)

[look at the source gen once we hit the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m02s)

[changed nothing else is is like this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m04s)

[the only place where the field gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m07s)

[written to so anywhere down here if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m08s)

[were to write to the field it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m10s)

[technically works right the other thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m12s)

[though that you can do is You don't have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m16s)

[to use the source generated version of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m18s)

[the property if you don't want right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m20s)

[like it's not it's not terrible you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m22s)

[private intu right to say you know what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m26s)

[I need to do something interesting here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m29s)

[right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m32s)

[like this is the base like this is what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m33s)

[the source generator is saving you from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m36s)

[so if you want to do something more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m38s)

[interesting you can always just abandon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m41s)

[the source generator like it's nice and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m43s)

[generates code for you um because most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m47s)

[of the time your properties look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m50s)

[identical however if you do run into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m53s)

[situation where you want to change it um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m55s)

[like Vic called out to me the other day](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m58s)

[uh a situation where the desire was to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m02s)

[have a private](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m04s)

[set well you can't do that with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m06s)

[source generator so fully implemented](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m08s)

[the property not a bad reason to do it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m10s)

[right if you want something of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m13s)

[nature so it's it's not a terrible idea](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m14s)

[if if what the source generator is doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m17s)

[for you is not quite right you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m21s)

[always just fall back to to writing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m24s)

[yourself like this used to be the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m27s)

[before source generators are were a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m29s)

[thing like this pattern was what I used](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m32s)

[to teach people for how to properly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m35s)

[implement a property inside of their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m37s)

[view model and it was a lot of typing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m40s)

[and then source generators came out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m42s)

[I fell absolutely in love with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m44s)

[them but yeah so if if there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m46s)

[something you want to do that's a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m48s)

[more interesting like you can always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m50s)

[fall back to doing this rather than](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m54s)

[trying to rather than trying to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m55s)

[something hacky around the source](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m57s)

[generator you can just uh take it out uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m58s)

[do something when food changes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m03s)

[i don't know well um I I guess it past](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m11s)

[tense perhaps right because after the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m14s)

[call to set property fu has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m16s)

[changed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m19s)

[uh oh you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m21s)

[right that's Thank you JC hold on hold](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m25s)

[on that one that one I strongly suspect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m28s)

[is actually wrong in my in my repo on my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m31s)

[template](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m35s)

[there uh to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m04s)

[generate let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m07s)

[unobservable property good eye JC you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m10s)

[are on point tonight uh yeah we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m22s)

[fixing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m24s)

[observable property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m26s)

[comment and push](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m30s)

[just gonna just gonna send that one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m33s)

[right on the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m35s)

[in okay I see no problem it all fixed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m37s)

[now so I'll have to push a an update to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m40s)

[the Nougat package at some point but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m44s)

[it's at least checked into the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m47s)

[repository so next release it'll go out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m48s)

[thank goodness it's not a a scarily bad](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m51s)

[change okay so this back to here will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m54s)

[get me a base class that does most of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m57s)

[what I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m00s)

[and then I don't need you anymore and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m04s)

[this gets me very good setup so this web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m07s)

[application factory then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m10s)

[becomes Vellopac web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m13s)

[i need to add a project reference to my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m16s)

[new my new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m20s)

[thingy that gets me into there and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m23s)

[I can delete I think this entire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m25s)

[file because I don't have any](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m29s)

[customization that I wish to do to this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m32s)

[file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m35s)

[whatsoever](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m38s)

[so that's nice that makes this is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m39s)

[this feels warm and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m43s)

[fuzzy okay let's see if we're compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m45s)

[and if we aren't we're going to adjust](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m49s)

[some things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m50s)

[i will say there is there is wisdom in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m54s)

[always slowing down and making sure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m56s)

[you're back in a working state before](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m58s)

[you get too carried away with things um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m00s)

[okay so this guy is failing but we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m02s)

[going to come back to him in a minute](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m05s)

[because we're going to need to pull over](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m07s)

[this endpoint test base but I think it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m08s)

[going to go into our new project uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m10s)

[let's see hmac authentication options](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m12s)

[configuration source is inaccessible](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m16s)

[well that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m18s)

[simple that's because we moved it into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m19s)

[another project so we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m21s)

[bring him](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m23s)

[public uh Stripe Service you changed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m28s)

[namespaces so we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m33s)

[uh we're going to grab it from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m37s)

[here at some point we are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m40s)

[change this one up to use the new base](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m43s)

[class but I think for now oh and you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m46s)

[don't have a reference to that project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m50s)

[yet so service core testing we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m53s)

[to add that in that way this reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m56s)

[resolves there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m02s)

[we want to get back into a compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m06s)

[state and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m09s)

[then where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m12s)

[this there we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m20s)

[go okay so that guy was leveraging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m23s)

[him his nameace is now fixed that goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m26s)

[away okay so this should get us back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m30s)

[into a working state just compile real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m33s)

[quick and make sure we're running um and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m35s)

[then just in an effort to be real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m38s)

[efficient here we're going to rerun the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m42s)

[test ignore the red that is that is from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m44s)

[a different branch i just haven't run it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m48s)

[on this branch on this machine since I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m51s)

[was working on it and so we should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m54s)

[more or less in the green i think we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m56s)

[aren't we're going to address any red](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m00s)

[and then circle back cuz right now the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m02s)

[the big thing is the new admin stuff is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m05s)

[untested but that's okay we're just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m07s)

[going to make sure all of these tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m09s)

[pass that's making me feel good so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m15s)

[far come on come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m21s)

[on tunit is fast i know JC i know i want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m24s)

[just I've got I've got a shared uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m30s)

[project and so like it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m33s)

[happen arish welcome welcome first time](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m36s)

[universe okay my universe is compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m50s)

[and my tests are running that means my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m53s)

[universe is happy okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m55s)

[wants endpoint test base which I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m58s)

[is over here and I believe I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m00s)

[bring this guy in yeah so this guy I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m03s)

[would like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m08s)

[move uh but he is going to be dependent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m10s)

[on temp file test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m12s)

[base which I'm going to need so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m15s)

[oop let's uh collection expression that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m19s)

[guy because new stuff is cool what is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m22s)

[the other blue line spelling spelling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m25s)

[don't care don't care okay so temp file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m28s)

[test base i want to move down into my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m30s)

[service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m35s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m41s)

[paste yeah um let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m44s)

[here then I want the namespace to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m49s)

[updated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m51s)

[change namespace okay that fixes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m53s)

[that you still](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m57s)

[work uh let's see i've seen a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m00s)

[devs who are doing C# use Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m03s)

[instead of VS Code but VS Code feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m06s)

[more modern elegant uh you're not wrong](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m08s)

[um VS Code is very much a built with a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m11s)

[newer tech stack visual Studio is it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m17s)

[got a lot of history so like the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m21s)

[comment about feels more modern yeah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m23s)

[like Visual Studio is not a product at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m26s)

[Microsoft that's owned by a single team](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m28s)

[like there's a lot of different teams](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m30s)

[and they all own different sections and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m32s)

[some of the tech in here is kind of old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m33s)

[so I will I will say that um it does get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m35s)

[updates uh like they they'll refresh the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m38s)

[UI and things like that to try to to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m42s)

[bring things forward um there is a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m44s)

[more I think it depends on what people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m47s)

[are looking for if you want a lot more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m49s)

[of like the fullfeatured IDE with those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m51s)

[deep debugging experience and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m54s)

[profiling and the integration and all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m56s)

[that Visual Studio far outplays VS Code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m58s)

[um VS Code used to have OmniSharp and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m02s)

[then their new what do they call it the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m05s)

[like the C dev kit I think is the name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m07s)

[of it um which is good but like it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m10s)

[somewhat simplistic in what it offers at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m15s)

[this point compared to Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m17s)

[like they're trying to build out the C#](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m20s)

[dev kit because they they obsoleted](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m22s)

[Visual Studio for Mac and so right now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m26s)

[VS Code with the C# DevKit is their Mac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m29s)

[solution and it just feels like it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m33s)

[lacking right now um and so yeah there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m35s)

[a lot of stuff that's missing like it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m39s)

[it is nowhere close to feature parody um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m41s)

[and part of it is is because Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m44s)

[Studio has been built up over decades um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m46s)

[I think the first release was in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m49s)

[98 something of that nature so when I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m53s)

[say decades like I'm not exaggerating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m56s)

[much like it is it is year old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m59s)

[um so or at least that's when it started](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m03s)

[and some code dates back I don't doubt](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m07s)

[probably 10 plus years easy in some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m09s)

[areas because occasionally you run into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m12s)

[stuff and you're like whoa that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m14s)

[clearly not been updated in a very long](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m16s)

[time um but yeah with that said it is if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m18s)

[you were on Windows Visual Studio does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m23s)

[kind of offer that premier experience](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m25s)

[there's a handful of features in like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m28s)

[their pro and enterprise tier that are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m30s)

[very nice specifically around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m34s)

[um some of the more advanced like live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m37s)

[unit testing features and some more of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m39s)

[those kind of integrated experiences um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m41s)

[if you're on the free tier of Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m44s)

[Studio um the community](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m46s)

[edition it's going to be a little closer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m49s)

[to to to what you might get in VS Code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m52s)

[and so there's a a fair judgment call to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m56s)

[be made there um for anybody on a Mac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m58s)

[honestly uh Jet Brains Writer is no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m01s)

[slouch when it comes to a a really good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m05s)

[IDE experience um my my personal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m08s)

[preference if I am building like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m11s)

[something crossplatform and I'm on a Mac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m13s)

[I'm I'm reaching for Writer as my IDE](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m15s)

[like it's not bad it's it's it's really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m18s)

[good um for people who have a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m21s)

[muscle memory with Visual Studio it's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m24s)

[little different if you ran ReSharper](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m26s)

[with Visual Studio Ryder feels very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m28s)

[familiar uh because a lot of that like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m31s)

[same company makes Ryder and ReSharper](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m33s)

[so there there's a lot of symmetry there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m36s)

[it's just Ryder is the IDE that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m38s)

[ReSharper tries to make Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m42s)

[into um it's just that because Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m44s)

[Studio is an extension it can only do so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m47s)

[much whereas Ryder it's the full ID they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m49s)

[can sky's the limit so um yeah I guess](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m51s)

[that that would be my thought again VS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m56s)

[Code is not bad and especially if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m58s)

[doing crossplatform stuff or you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m00s)

[doing anything web- based um like most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m02s)

[of the people I work with like even](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m06s)

[myself if I'm going to work on like the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m08s)

[front-end website um I'm reaching for VS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m10s)

[Code to do my React stuff not Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m13s)

[Studio uh but if I'm doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m15s)

[C anything that's remotely serious I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m18s)

[probably jumping back into Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m21s)

[rather than doing it in VS Code if it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m23s)

[quick and easy like we just did the um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m25s)

[the edit to the .NET template and I did](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m28s)

[the the VS Code in the browser to to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m30s)

[edit it right there in line on GitHub](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m33s)

[because it's like eh it's quick it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m34s)

[easy and I think that's where VS Code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m36s)

[really shines is for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m38s)

[it's that quick easy editor that they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m41s)

[can reach for um and for some people it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m43s)

[makes for a full IDE experience but it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m45s)

[really does rely heavily on its](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m49s)

[extensions to provide that IDE](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m51s)

[experience and the C# DevKit feature](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m54s)

[forfeature is way behind Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m57s)

[mostly because it's way behind in years](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m00s)

[of development too because it was just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m02s)

[released last year I think so it's yeah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m04s)

[like it's moving fast and it'll probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m09s)

[get a lot of good features in a few](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m12s)

[years it might be a a a much better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m14s)

[competitor especially in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m17s)

[cross-platform universe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m18s)

[but for now if you're on Windows doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m20s)

[net Visual Studio is kind of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m25s)

[premier experience with I think Writer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m27s)

[taking second and then maybe VS Code in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m30s)

[third but it's like things things start](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m33s)

[dropping off when you get into third](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m36s)

[place those are my two cents uh did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m38s)

[move endpoint test base no I did not uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m41s)

[that is the next thing I would like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m44s)

[move we're going to pick you up put you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m46s)

[down okay and then this needs to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m52s)

[uh so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m58s)

[want I'm going to need to make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m03s)

[generic is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m05s)

[problem t program and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m09s)

[think I just do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m12s)

[um let's if I change the name space](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m21s)

[that'll fix the the missing using there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m23s)

[because now they should be alongside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m27s)

[each](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m28s)

[other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m29s)

[um oh didn't change that name space so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m34s)

[that caught a bug so that was nice okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m37s)

[so those two are alongside each other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m40s)

[this guy now needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m42s)

[a where program is there and then this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m44s)

[is probably just going to need to change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m47s)

[up to be more like this and more like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m49s)

[this and this is going to be I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m52s)

[know why I had that as public if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m55s)

[have a an abstract class it's rare to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m57s)

[ever need the constructor as public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m00s)

[because by definition an abstract class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m02s)

[is must be um subclassed so often times](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m05s)

[an abstract class will the constructor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m10s)

[will just be uh protected let's see what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m13s)

[do you think about the this whole AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m17s)

[replacing software developers that is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m19s)

[great question and very much a hot topic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m21s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m24s)

[um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m26s)

[I I do not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m28s)

[think that AI is going to com like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m31s)

[think AI will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m34s)

[change how software developers work i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m36s)

[don't think it's going to replace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m40s)

[software](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m41s)

[developers right like in in ye olden](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m42s)

[days people did punch cards and they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m45s)

[wrote assembly and it was all this very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m47s)

[low-level stuff and it was hard to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m49s)

[and and then we got uh better tooling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m51s)

[and higher abstraction languages and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m54s)

[things kind of moved up higher and for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m56s)

[the most part we don't have to think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m59s)

[about lower level stuff right now like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m01s)

[write C i don't usually have to think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m03s)

[about the underlying IL or any of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m06s)

[stuff and so I think AI will potentially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m09s)

[bring another layer up perhaps of what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m13s)

[we have what that ends up looking like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m17s)

[not generating great code yet and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m22s)

[there's a lot of people who are like "Oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m24s)

[it's but it it it will soon in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m25s)

[future." I'm like I don't doubt that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m27s)

[can get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m29s)

[better but right now like it's barely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m31s)

[junior level and like it it causes more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m34s)

[mistakes and so like I think what is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m40s)

[more likely to occur is the the low code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m43s)

[no code solutions that people have like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m47s)

[the Microsoft Power Apps type situation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m50s)

[i think AI will make those types of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m52s)

[solutions more prominent and better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m56s)

[because right now they're kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m58s)

[limited in what they can do but once you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m59s)

[start adding in some AI for people who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m01s)

[may not know how to dive deep into the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m04s)

[code it's going to give them a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m05s)

[options where they where they might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m07s)

[able to start solving problems that they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m10s)

[otherwise wouldn't be able to so I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m12s)

[that area will get bigger and will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m14s)

[probably in some ways replace what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m17s)

[otherwise would have been a custom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m20s)

[developer solution right where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m21s)

[needed a dev now you've got these low](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m22s)

[code people that can solve more problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m24s)

[so maybe you don't need custom software](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m27s)

[in all those cases](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m28s)

[but consistently it's always been the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m31s)

[developers who understand what's kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m34s)

[going on under the covers tend to become](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m36s)

[the better developers and I think this I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m39s)

[don't think AI is going to change that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m42s)

[it's going to be the developers who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m44s)

[understand what's going on who can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m45s)

[better evaluate like the output that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m48s)

[they're getting from the AI um the ones](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m51s)

[who understand how the underlying code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m54s)

[works who can evaluate the AA's output](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m56s)

[and go "Yeah no." like that may compile](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m58s)

[that may run and do the thing but no we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m01s)

[are not doing that that's a horrible](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m03s)

[idea right those types of things I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m04s)

[the like I don't see those types of good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m08s)

[developers going away and then people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m12s)

[always talk about the the supply chain](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m14s)

[effectively of developers right like if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m17s)

[AI replaces all our junior developers](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m18s)

[where are we going to get senior](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m20s)

[developers right like there has to be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m22s)

[pipeline up and I think AI is likely to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m24s)

[accelerate the learning Like I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m28s)

[noticed even in my usage of it it makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m30s)

[it much easier for me to quickly learn](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m33s)

[things or get through problems like it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m36s)

[it's fairly good at that like even if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m38s)

[especially when I don't know like the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m41s)

[right things to put into the Googles to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m43s)

[get the right information that I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m45s)

[oftentimes going back and forth with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m48s)

[co-pilot I will start to figure out the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m49s)

[right terminology and the things that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m52s)

[need to put into Google to get to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m54s)

[right thing even if it doesn't solve my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m55s)

[problem it can oftentimes hint me in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m57s)

[right direction and it can often times](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m59s)

[help me learn new concepts especially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m02s)

[because most of the time it's like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m04s)

[memorize the docs so it's usually pretty](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m06s)

[good where it's like okay I don't want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m08s)

[to waste my time sifting through docs to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m10s)

[find this just give me the answer from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m12s)

[the docs like I'm going to go Google](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m13s)

[this anyway save me some time and it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m15s)

[really good for that so I think it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m17s)

[will not kill off juniors but I think it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m20s)

[will potentially accelerate how fast](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m24s)

[people move through that junior stage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m27s)

[because I think it has the potential of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m30s)

[improving learning when used well as a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m32s)

[tool right like it's just a tool it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m35s)

[not it's not anything more than than a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m38s)

[very advanced tool that that people are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m41s)

[leveraging right people are getting very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m42s)

[excited about these AI experiences that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m44s)

[that people are building like Microsoft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m46s)

[is building out like um all these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m48s)

[co-pilot type experiences and like it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m51s)

[important to remember these co-pilot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m54s)

[experiences that Microsoft is building](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m56s)

[out are not one AI engine like there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m57s)

[lot of layers and complexity in these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m00s)

[systems and there's a lot of different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m02s)

[pieces and different AI agents working](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m04s)

[together so this is not just one oh you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m07s)

[have an AI thing and now poof look you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m10s)

[can generate this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m12s)

[Um yeah and AI putting you down the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m14s)

[wrong path like that is that is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m17s)

[consistent problem in in that that often](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m18s)

[happens quite a bit and so like I'm very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m23s)

[happy to use Copilot in my code because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m25s)

[oftentimes especially for for refactors](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m27s)

[and and little things like middlegen](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m30s)

[stuff and do an awesome job like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m33s)

[especially repetitive boring things I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m36s)

[very happy to do it when it gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m38s)

[complicated or or things where I know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m40s)

[it's important i'm very likely to not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m42s)

[use it because I don't I don't trust it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m44s)

[to be accurate or I'll let it jen and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m46s)

[then I'll go back over it with a fine](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m48s)

[tooth comb because it's like how do I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m49s)

[know that you didn't screw this up right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m52s)

[the same as what I would do is if I if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m54s)

[hand a real important task to a junior](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m56s)

[developer I'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m58s)

[scrutinize it harder scrutinize the AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m59s)

[just as hard so I think that like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m02s)

[think it'll fundamentally change how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m06s)

[things work i think the low code no code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m08s)

[solutions are likely to expand quite a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m11s)

[bit um and potentially I think that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m13s)

[where the the loss of developer jobs may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m16s)

[go right it's not necessarily going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m20s)

[be AI taking the jobs but it's AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m22s)

[enhancing the low code no code um app](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m25s)

[builders so that they can move into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m29s)

[bigger space and solve more problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m32s)

[that they otherwise couldn't where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m34s)

[previously people would have to hire a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m36s)

[developer to do i think those jobs may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m37s)

[go away and but they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m40s)

[aren't like yes they're going away from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m42s)

[a developer but it's not like the it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m45s)

[not like the problem goes away right the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m46s)

[company still has the problem that those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m48s)

[apps are solving um I just think that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m50s)

[those those kind of low code no code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m53s)

[solution people will will start eating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m56s)

[some of those easier problems or more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m58s)

[simplistic type software um and I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m01s)

[that's potentially where there might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m03s)

[jobs lost but I don't See I don't see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m05s)

[software engineering going away like I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m09s)

[not worried about it replacing me during](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m13s)

[my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m16s)

[lifetime so and if my kids told me hey I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m17s)

[want to go into computer science I would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m20s)

[not discourage them from it i think it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m23s)

[still a a very viable thing i think it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m26s)

[it's different right like when I went to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m28s)

[school it was you know C and C++ and now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m30s)

[it's a little more oh well let's let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m33s)

[teach Python and C and some of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m35s)

[other things like okay right like the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m37s)

[the field advances and I think it's just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m40s)

[going to kind of push that abstraction](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m43s)

[up a little higher but I don't think it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m44s)

[goes away changes sure I think that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m46s)

[probably a given at this point but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m49s)

[don't think it's some people are doom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m51s)

[and gloom and freaking out and I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m54s)

[not that concerned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m57s)

[because people who can solve problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m59s)

[and build solutions there is a high](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m01s)

[demand so I think that's the key thing I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m06s)

[would tell people is focus on learning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m09s)

[how to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m10s)

[build build solutions and then it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m11s)

[doesn't matter whether it's with C with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m15s)

[AI right if you can build a quality](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m17s)

[solution that stands up that's at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m20s)

[end of the day that's what people want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m22s)

[they want software to solve a problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m24s)

[for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m26s)

[them and software engineers are just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m27s)

[generally the people tasked with doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m30s)

[that but again power apps people may may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m32s)

[start doing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m36s)

[start doing a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m38s)

[more because I I I I have felt that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m39s)

[those low code solutions or like the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m42s)

[app generators or quick go from idea to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m44s)

[prototypes things like they generally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m47s)

[don't do a great job and now I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m49s)

[that they they actually might be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m52s)

[start doing a better job oh Harris thank](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m54s)

[you for the follow i appreciate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m56s)

[it hopefully I'm not making everything](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m59s)

[too uh doom and gloom for you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m01s)

[okay so that should go there and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m05s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m08s)

[uh no don't do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m10s)

[that uh let's see so this I want to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m13s)

[still want this to be web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m18s)

[factory why are you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m21s)

[unhappy do you not appropriately drive](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m24s)

[oh you don't i need you to be fellow](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m28s)

[pack web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m32s)

[that way okay so I am going to have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m35s)

[convert you over as soon as I change the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m37s)

[space class okay so but we'll get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m38s)

[through that in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m41s)

[moment uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m43s)

[see this does not contain access to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m46s)

[this why not it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m49s)

[protected am I an idiot isn't that what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m54s)

[protected means there's your problem uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m57s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m00s)

[oh it's because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m06s)

[haven't got it okay i've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m08s)

[conflicting i need to deal with this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m12s)

[before that's going to work okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m14s)

[okay maybe I should address that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m16s)

[first can't decide probably worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m20s)

[probably worth probably worth addressing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m23s)

[this first okay so this exists in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m25s)

[base class kill it this exists in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m28s)

[base class this exists in the base class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m30s)

[same with all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m34s)

[loggers those exist configure service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m35s)

[callbacks exist same with that same with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m39s)

[that none of this needs to change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m42s)

[configure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m45s)

[client](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m47s)

[is currently the same in the base class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m49s)

[though I'm realizing no that's probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m52s)

[fine okay this is where things are going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m55s)

[to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m57s)

[to change a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m59s)

[bit um because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m03s)

[want these things to get added because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m08s)

[this guy is referencing extra stuff that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m12s)

[the other one isn't so let me look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m14s)

[what collapse those two guys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m16s)

[up okay so what got saved down here so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m20s)

[you need So I don't need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m24s)

[you right i am going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m26s)

[you um let's see file upload message Q](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m30s)

[needs to stay storage needs to stay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m34s)

[stripe service can go logger can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m37s)

[go uh DB context can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m41s)

[go registering](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m45s)

[self oh this is interesting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m48s)

[this is interesting so there so these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m54s)

[two lines here are not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m57s)

[equal this is what's weird so in C the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m00s)

[this add singleton you'll note here on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m05s)

[the left oh see if I can crab that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m08s)

[again right so you'll note this is add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m10s)

[singleton web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m13s)

[non-generic right this is the fully uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m15s)

[derived class type right but if I go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m18s)

[here right this one is bellopac web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m21s)

[application factory t](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m25s)

[program and this is this is very subtle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m28s)

[because the the lines look identical and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m31s)

[when I copied from a to b and redid the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m34s)

[class it like I didn't have to touch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m36s)

[this code but it infers the generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m38s)

[parameter because of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m41s)

[this and this is not the same on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m43s)

[left and the right and I think we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m46s)

[going to kill this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m48s)

[because I don't I don't think there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m50s)

[anything that is trying to resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m53s)

[from honestly I don't know why I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m59s)

[either of them so we're going to whack](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m01s)

[them both because I don't I'm curious](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m02s)

[what is trying to resolve the factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m05s)

[the web application factory itself it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m08s)

[probably some extension I've built](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m10s)

[but I can't remember what pass Kevin did](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m13s)

[and pass Kevin didn't leave me a note so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m16s)

[we're going to delete it uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m19s)

[authentication handler is done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m21s)

[authorization is done email client mock](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m24s)

[is not so we need to keep this and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m28s)

[for each and I think what I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m30s)

[do is I am going to inject this call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m33s)

[back above the call to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m37s)

[base because most of these things were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m39s)

[registered first but it shouldn't make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m42s)

[any difference these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m44s)

[are Well shoot hold on this is calling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m46s)

[base so I or it's calling replace so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m49s)

[need the base registration to occur](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m53s)

[first wait a carac is making it hard to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m56s)

[read okay um that goes like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m00s)

[that authenticate async i don't think we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m04s)

[need any of this all the authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m08s)

[stuff remains the same for now we might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m10s)

[have to do something funky when we get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m14s)

[around to dealing with the HMAX stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m16s)

[but we haven't gotten there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m19s)

[yet we're going to get rid of this get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m20s)

[rid of this get rid of user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m23s)

[context eight minutes until a very very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m26s)

[special announcement here's a hint it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m30s)

[midnight for me uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m32s)

[okay that goes like that that goes like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m36s)

[that that goes like that good good good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m38s)

[okay close that and if I go back here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m41s)

[now what is your problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m44s)

[here lac web application program does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m47s)

[not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m51s)

[contain a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m51s)

[factory sure post requires](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m57s)

[oh this is the authentication oh these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m00s)

[are the extension methods I wrote that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m04s)

[why I can't find them so up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m06s)

[here I have these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m11s)

[guys um I think we want to move this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m18s)

[down as well into service testing so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m22s)

[these are extension methods that I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m25s)

[feed URLs to and they're just there to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m27s)

[make sure that I don't botch my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m30s)

[authentication stuff right if a if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m32s)

[something requires it to be an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m35s)

[authenticated call it intentionally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m37s)

[makes a call without it being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m39s)

[authenticated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m41s)

[um and just asserts that it gets an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m42s)

[unauthorized no more it's no more fancy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m45s)

[than that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m47s)

[so if we move this down here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m49s)

[um change name space to match folder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m57s)

[structure and then this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m59s)

[uh velopac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m06s)

[uh t program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m10s)

[then the key part here is we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m15s)

[put the generic parameter on the method](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m16s)

[um uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m22s)

[see simply for one reason um because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m24s)

[same the same thing that that caused the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m28s)

[confusion with the registration of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m33s)

[parameter we can abuse that same thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m36s)

[so that we don't have to go and update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m38s)

[all of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m40s)

[code so if I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m41s)

[this t](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m45s)

[program and so we'll let it we'll let](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m47s)

[the compiler infer i'm going to just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m49s)

[this that makes me feel better uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m52s)

[see uh where tp program is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m55s)

[class oh I didn't add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m00s)

[it we go there we go there we go okay so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m07s)

[that gets me to there that gets me to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m10s)

[there we are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m12s)

[do this maneuver actually I think we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m14s)

[just going to do this maneuver now I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m17s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m20s)

[go important to make the sound that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m21s)

[very important uh and then we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m24s)

[to grab T](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m26s)

[program there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m29s)

[there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m32s)

[there right and then we're going to grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m35s)

[the wear](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m37s)

[clause and we're just going to slap it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m39s)

[in fix my indentation that I clearly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m43s)

[botched somewhere along the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m45s)

[line clean that up clean that up clean](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m48s)

[that up okay so all of those now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m51s)

[work and what that means is this guy now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m53s)

[magically compiles and so he has now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m56s)

[inferred the appropriate generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m58s)

[parameter i don't have to do so and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m00s)

[all of these this code that I've written](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m03s)

[previously just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m05s)

[works right that's the game](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m06s)

[plan okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m09s)

[so this guy now exists and works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m12s)

[great so now it means that each time I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m16s)

[spin one of these new test classes which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m18s)

[I'm going to need to do one for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m20s)

[partner side in addition to the admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m22s)

[side so I'm going to have to do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m23s)

[another time so part of why I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m25s)

[refactoring this is because I know I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m27s)

[going to get hosed by this later](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m29s)

[okay so the change here is to bring](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m32s)

[in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m36s)

[program on all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m40s)

[these and what is your problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m44s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m04s)

[interesting how did I handle it here i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m05s)

[didn't factory does not have a fixture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m11s)

[source if it comes from a collection](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m15s)

[definition assume the definition is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m18s)

[same assembly as the test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m20s)

[oh am I going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m24s)

[do I don't know if I can class fixture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m26s)

[this uh I don't think I can class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m29s)

[fixture this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m31s)

[in because of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m34s)

[limitation bothers me because I know I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m38s)

[going to have to change this when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m41s)

[um I switch to TUN because it handles](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m46s)

[this slightly differently](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m48s)

[but now that fixes that but secretly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m50s)

[what I actually want to copy is that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m53s)

[whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m55s)

[line right and so then when I go here I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m55s)

[actually just want to paste that and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m58s)

[then it fixes it because at the end of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m00s)

[the day XUnit uses class fixture to say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m03s)

[here's how you inject the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m06s)

[constructor parameter and because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m09s)

[base class is abstract it's not going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m11s)

[be creating that class it's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m14s)

[creating one of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m16s)

[instead okay so let's close this close](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m17s)

[this close this i F8](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m21s)

[paste that's good so hopefully it's as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m25s)

[simple as just F8 paste f8 paste f8](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m28s)

[paste](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m33s)

[um may come back to that public surface](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m38s)

[API test here in a bit because that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m40s)

[that's the first test we want to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m43s)

[uh let's see this one already had it so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m49s)

[that's weird feels like I made a mistake](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m52s)

[somewhere along the line or and didn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m54s)

[clean something up but that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m56s)

[okay okay compile](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m00s)

[and once we get this guy rolling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m05s)

[why is this one not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m14s)

[using i'm just looking because this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m31s)

[the user stuff i'm wondering is there a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m34s)

[reason I did this one differently i](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m36s)

[don't think there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m38s)

[is okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m42s)

[i think I just failed to update one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m54s)

[these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m58s)

[um we'll get this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m02s)

[guy updated to match because they I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m05s)

[don't know why any of these things would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m08s)

[be different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m10s)

[then all of that continues to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m14s)

[work in reality this is actually a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m18s)

[beautiful use case for doing primary](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m20s)

[constructors but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m22s)

[uh let's see have you found in TUN that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m28s)

[you can't rightclick in VS and run debug](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m30s)

[a test oh just like the menus right here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m33s)

[um I have not seen that JC um if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m38s)

[running into that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m43s)

[so I don't know if that would be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m46s)

[T-Unit issue as much as that might be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m48s)

[um what is it called the new testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m53s)

[framework so when I did my stream about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m56s)

[upgrading to TUNI there were subtly the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m59s)

[two things that we upgraded because it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m01s)

[the the Microsoft I don't remember what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m03s)

[sucker is called](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m06s)

[um uh testing framework](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m10s)

[i Microsoft testing platform MTP that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m15s)

[the MA that's the acronym I'm looking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m18s)

[for um I suspect it's probably actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m20s)

[MTP that's breaking because that's where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m25s)

[the integration is um XUnit still works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m28s)

[but which XUnit is it xunit 3 with MTP](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m32s)

[or not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m36s)

[because I would imagine it's probably an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m37s)

[MTP failure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m40s)

[versus a TUNT one so and I I realize](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m43s)

[that this is probably subtle so TUNT is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m47s)

[only built for M for Microsoft testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m51s)

[platform it won't run elsewhere so if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m53s)

[you're on TUnit you have to be running](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m55s)

[the new Microsoft testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m56s)

[platform if you run xunit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m58s)

[um if you're on xunit v2](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m02s)

[um you are on the old vs test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m05s)

[runner and if you are on xunit v3 you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m09s)

[could be on either depending on which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m13s)

[nougat packages you have referenced if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m14s)

[that isn't confusing enough for you um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m16s)

[and where is they have a picture on one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m19s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m21s)

[pages they have a picture showing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m22s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m25s)

[the it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m27s)

[here one of these things they have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m30s)

[nice picture showing the the difference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m34s)

[between where is it i remember seeing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m37s)

[at one point um they have a nice picture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m40s)

[showing the difference in architecture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m42s)

[between the Microsoft testing platform](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m44s)

[and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m47s)

[um VS test because VS test is the old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m48s)

[system that they have where when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m52s)

[rightclick and run there is it's got the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m54s)

[outofband test runner it has to load the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m58s)

[assemblies and do all of this stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m01s)

[whereas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m03s)

[MTP it's um you'll note the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m05s)

[compilation output of your test project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m08s)

[just becomes a standard XE so it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m10s)

[nothing fancy it's literally just an XU](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m13s)

[uh it's just an a standalone executable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m16s)

[because you can actually take the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m18s)

[compilation from an MTP project and just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m19s)

[go run that XI somewhere that's it right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m22s)

[it's no more like it's that simple no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m24s)

[more needing to run net test blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m26s)

[blah but there's still that integration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m28s)

[back and forth and so I if it's falling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m31s)

[over I I'm tempted to blame it here um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m35s)

[if it's not working the other thing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m38s)

[be aware of is where is it is it it up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m41s)

[here where's the submit feedback](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m44s)

[button oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m47s)

[here this this little guy up here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m49s)

[um definitely send a feedback report on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m54s)

[on something like that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m57s)

[because I because it's the new thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m59s)

[with all of the changes and whatnot if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m02s)

[there's going to be bugs I'm I'm real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m04s)

[keen on blaming the new thing it could](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m06s)

[still be a T-Unit issue but because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m08s)

[you're talking about like the rightclick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m11s)

[interaction in Visual Studio I suspect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m13s)

[it's more likely Visual Studio's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m15s)

[integration with MTP and less the actual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m18s)

[testing framework inside of MTP is is my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m22s)

[thinking that would that would be my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m26s)

[gut](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m29s)

[reaction okay so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m32s)

[compiled okay so now let's go back here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m34s)

[test run all tests let's re Let's rerun](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m38s)

[i want to make sure that I haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m40s)

[broken anything i should probably be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m41s)

[making commits as I go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m43s)

[honestly not making commits is probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m46s)

[going to hose me because at some point](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m49s)

[I'm going to need to go backwards and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m51s)

[figure out what the heck I did and I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m52s)

[been running all night with zero commit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m55s)

[see I broke something i broke something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m57s)

[something very fundamental](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m59s)

[apparently okay let's just pick on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m01s)

[Uh I'm sorry not what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m08s)

[wanted clean that up what was the actual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m11s)

[failure so response status does not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m14s)

[indicate success well what a shock right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m16s)

[uh 500 internal server error so that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m19s)

[not useful we're going to debug the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m22s)

[test and we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m28s)

[Spelunkin and see where the heck this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m30s)

[thing fell over](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m32s)

[i imagine it's going to be somewhere in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m34s)

[the DI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m36s)

[registration uh let's see jump out jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m39s)

[in jump out jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m44s)

[in okay you are not being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m49s)

[helpful okay not a helpful response let](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m55s)

[me just look at are the are are all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m58s)

[these going to be similar](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m00s)

[okay unable to resolve service lookup](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m03s)

[see there we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m05s)

[go look at that so it is that resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m08s)

[this what did I write that leverages](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m16s)

[it because I I assume I had to write](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m22s)

[something that leveraged it but it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m25s)

[activate oh the test off handler is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m33s)

[what's doing Oh oh okay okay got it got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m36s)

[it got it got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m41s)

[got it got it got it this is actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m42s)

[probably worthwhile thing to slow down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m44s)

[and explain right so this is uh I saw a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m46s)

[tweet the other day that said "If you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m50s)

[can explain dependency injection to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m51s)

[developers." It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m55s)

[like I don't know if that's accurate but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m56s)

[it it definitely is one of the bars that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m59s)

[I look at with people so the key thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m01s)

[here unable to resolve service for type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m03s)

[the moment you see this message this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m05s)

[a dependency injection issue right you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m07s)

[either haven't registered something or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m10s)

[the service type that you're trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m12s)

[look up is different than what you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m13s)

[registered as or something right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m15s)

[effectively it's I tried to get a thingy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m16s)

[and I couldn't find the thingy so I went](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m19s)

[boom right that's that's what the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m21s)

[exception means](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m23s)

[but so it's attempting to resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m25s)

[service for type and so this is the type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m27s)

[that it's looking for and you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m30s)

[this is our Velopac web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m32s)

[factory and the back tick one here this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m34s)

[is the this is the way that generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m37s)

[types get tworing right so if you see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m40s)

[back tick one what you know is that is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m42s)

[generic type with a single with an arity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m45s)

[of one so a single generic parameter and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m48s)

[in this case because it's a closed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m50s)

[generic meaning We know the value of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m54s)

[t that's inside of it we know that it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m56s)

[programmed so we know this is it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m58s)

[looking to resolve over a closed type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m00s)

[right uh while attempting to activate so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m03s)

[while attempting to activate means this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m07s)

[other thingy has a dependency on this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m09s)

[thingy right so when trying to call the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m13s)

[constructor for this other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m16s)

[type that constructor likely has a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m19s)

[parameter that points at this right so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m22s)

[if we go look at web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m24s)

[and you'll note back tick one so the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m27s)

[generic class and then the plus means](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m29s)

[nested class so inside of web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m32s)

[application factory here there is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m35s)

[class called test off handler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m38s)

[it inherits the generic type program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m42s)

[from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m45s)

[there so what we need to do is we need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m46s)

[to go look at this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m50s)

[guy boom so you'll note there he is in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m52s)

[our class and there is the registration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m56s)

[so this is the constructor parameter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m00s)

[that it was looking for and so my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m01s)

[comment before about I didn't know which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m04s)

[one of those services registered this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m06s)

[was the appropriate one to do in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m08s)

[case I want because I know that this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m11s)

[the guy looking for him this test off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m13s)

[handler i know that um the generic one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m16s)

[with T program not the one not the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m20s)

[derived class is the one that I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m23s)

[register as so I come down here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m24s)

[we're going to go uh services add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m28s)

[singleton this and present Kevin knows](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m33s)

[that he should leave a comment so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m36s)

[future Kevin doesn't delete this one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m38s)

[like he did last time uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m40s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m45s)

[here uh where did it go where did it go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m46s)

[uh this is used by test o handler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m50s)

[to find the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m56s)

[uh parent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m00s)

[factory there we go see simple as that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m02s)

[now we're going to just run one of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m06s)

[tests to make sure that I fixed the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m07s)

[obvious problem before we send them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m10s)

[all okay that worked so now we run the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m13s)

[whole suite](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m15s)

[make sure everything else is working but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m18s)

[now that the one worked it's probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m20s)

[that most of these are going to flare](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m22s)

[out okay so we still have something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m25s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m26s)

[broken click on one of these ones to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m27s)

[take a look at so we always want to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m30s)

[from working to working so let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m32s)

[what is broken here it's weird that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m35s)

[there's so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m37s)

[many uh status code not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m39s)

[found oh I'm sorry expected not found](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m43s)

[but found internal server error](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m45s)

[ah okay so this is same problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m52s)

[different different symptoms oh even](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m56s)

[better even better right so this is now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m58s)

[attempting to use the derived web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m02s)

[application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m04s)

[factory while attempting to activate and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m05s)

[in this case it's the simulator local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m08s)

[file storage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m10s)

[manager right so when I said I don't see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m12s)

[why we need this i'm going to delete](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m16s)

[both what I should have said is this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m17s)

[clearly needed and I should keep both so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m19s)

[you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m23s)

[know not my not my finest moment um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m24s)

[let's jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m29s)

[here and then go up to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m30s)

[top uh let's see and I want to go to web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m34s)

[application factory and in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m37s)

[here we will do services](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m41s)

[uh register](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m45s)

[uh add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m48s)

[singleton this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m50s)

[uh this is needed by the uh local uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m55s)

[file storage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m01s)

[manager yeah that's probably good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m04s)

[enough yep and at some point if this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m09s)

[moves into the core we'll be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m11s)

[delete it but for now while he lives up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m14s)

[here uh it needs to exist we will come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m17s)

[back up here we will rerun this one guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m20s)

[make sure he passes and then if he does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m24s)

[we send it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m26s)

[all oh still failed no that one passed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m32s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m36s)

[top level node still showed failed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m38s)

[because it contained failed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m40s)

[test okay we are working so we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m47s)

[to make a commit really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m49s)

[quick uh and I am going to hit the auto](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m51s)

[code button or the auto comment button](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m54s)

[uh validation off logic to service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m58s)

[core uh service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m00s)

[project uh you missed you missed most of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m03s)

[it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m07s)

[um added implementation to admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m09s)

[service okay so there goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m15s)

[that we're going to push that while I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m19s)

[weird in my day job i keep getting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m26s)

[surrounded by people that are younger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m28s)

[and younger than me and I'm like "Oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m29s)

[when did I become the old guy in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m32s)

[room?" Like I'm not used to being the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m34s)

[old guy in the room this feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m36s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m40s)

[uh was there a file in here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m43s)

[already oh look at that it had](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m46s)

[generated huh okay so we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m54s)

[just copy this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m57s)

[over because for now this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m00s)

[the public facing API surface and this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m03s)

[should now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m05s)

[pass bill's birthday thank you very much](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m06s)

[i appreciate it yay test pass okay so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m10s)

[for anybody con confused about this so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m14s)

[this is using um verify which is known](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m16s)

[as snapshot testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m20s)

[um trying to remember there's other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m23s)

[names that snapshot testing goes by but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m25s)

[effectively anything you can stringify](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m28s)

[you can snapshot test and so in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m30s)

[case I am kind of stringifying it but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m32s)

[I'm just grabbing my my open API spec so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m36s)

[you'll note there's this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m39s)

[verify.txt and this just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m41s)

[contains the working one here so if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m43s)

[there are any changes to my open API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m47s)

[spec this test fails so it means that if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m49s)

[there is going to be any breaking API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m53s)

[changes right because the this swagger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m56s)

[doc is generated from my public facing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m00s)

[stuff so if I add a property or I delete](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m02s)

[something or I rename something this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m04s)

[test breaks and I have to explicitly go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m06s)

[in and usually you copy the received](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m09s)

[into the verified file but it shows you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m12s)

[the diff and so you can very easily see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m15s)

[the difference between received verified](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m17s)

[and go well yep that changes expected](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m18s)

[copied in so for now because this isn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m21s)

[a shipped API I'm just always copying it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m23s)

[in right because right now we expect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m25s)

[massive changes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m28s)

[okay so that much there is in we have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m31s)

[our first test huzzah now we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m33s)

[we've got that much going now what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m37s)

[want to do is we actually want to test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m39s)

[our the whole the whole point of doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m41s)

[this is so that we can actually test our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m44s)

[partner our partner API like that our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m46s)

[admin for the partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m49s)

[API all of this just to get just to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m51s)

[set up and going but I think the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m55s)

[refactor is going to be good because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m56s)

[going to have to do this again and now I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m58s)

[feel like I've got this service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m00s)

[testing is going to make me feel a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m02s)

[better so I I I think it'll be better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m04s)

[right and so I do uh a v1 because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m07s)

[not actually testing the extension](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m11s)

[methods i'm I'm I'm functionally testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m13s)

[these guys and I'm just going to copy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m15s)

[this guy up here paste and then we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m17s)

[going to go beat them into submission so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m21s)

[step one fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m23s)

[namespace and get rid of all this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m27s)

[garbage okay and so because we're named](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m29s)

[web application factory and program in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m32s)

[both places that all just works huzzah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m34s)

[okay and now we do this type of stuff so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m36s)

[uh create API key so we are actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m40s)

[going to be testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m44s)

[um well I guess we start at the top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m55s)

[right so let's uh we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m58s)

[these in a different order and we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m01s)

[going to bring this guy up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m03s)

[so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m06s)

[list I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m08s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m10s)

[partner list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m12s)

[partners yeah we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m14s)

[requires authenticated user right and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m16s)

[I I'm going to have to convert all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m14s)

[those from data objects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m16s)

[into endpoint](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m19s)

[objects let's let's back up because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m25s)

[there's only a handful of properties on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m27s)

[these uh should be equivalent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m30s)

[to let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m34s)

[coupon3.name oh this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m54s)

[awkward one to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m58s)

[um our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m02s)

[that we'll we'll get them in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m09s)

[consistent order of our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m11s)

[received coupons do that and now what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m16s)

[can do is Yeah you freaking show off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m20s)

[Copilot uh no we are not doing that that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m23s)

[received](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m32s)

[coupons select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m35s)

[X.name should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m38s)

[be equivalent to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m41s)

[uh ordered](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m44s)

[coupons select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m46s)

[X.name right so that should get me to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m49s)

[there and then we're going to just rinse](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m53s)

[repeat this for the other ones right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m55s)

[because we only we don't expect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m56s)

[everything to be included we expect ids](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m58s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m01s)

[match now that we've got them in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m04s)

[stable sort and then we expect the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m06s)

[stripe coupon ID to match as well and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m08s)

[know there's a cleaner way to do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m11s)

[with um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m13s)

[uh strictly speaking should ordered](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m18s)

[coupons be in a range](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m20s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m23s)

[h](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m29s)

[probably probably there there there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m33s)

[there's a weird judgment call when it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m36s)

[only being used as to to make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m38s)

[assertions but you are correct that the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m43s)

[data being populated into it is all up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m45s)

[here so it makes slightly more sense for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m48s)

[them to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m50s)

[be in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m51s)

[area so yeah I would say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m54s)

[yes um okay and then I am going to whack](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m57s)

[all of these guys out of here for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m02s)

[cuz I want to see this thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m04s)

[work um this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m10s)

[wrong i mean it's going to work but to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m14s)

[do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m17s)

[So that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m28s)

[failed yeah yeah like I think there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m32s)

[judgment call JC depending on like if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m35s)

[the data is only used to make assertions](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m38s)

[I don't mind like I kind of equate it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m40s)

[functionally to this but you are right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m43s)

[that technically the ordering happens up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m45s)

[here um what did I what did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m48s)

[break no handler is registered for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m56s)
