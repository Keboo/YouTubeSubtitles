[Hello everyone. Welcome back. Uh tonight](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m02s)

[we're going to do something a little bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m04s)

[different. Um I have some web API work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m06s)

[that needs to happen. So this is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m09s)

[to be some Velopac backend stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m11s)

[Unfortunately, this repo is private, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m14s)

[as one of the founders, um I can choose](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m16s)

[to stream private stuff when you're one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m19s)

[of the owners. So you can get away with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m21s)

[that kind of stuff. So that's what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m22s)

[going to do. We are going to be uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m24s)

[taking a look at that and I'll explain a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m26s)

[little bit more about what that's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m28s)

[to look like in just a moment. But a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m30s)

[couple things. First of all, Microsoft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m34s)

[Build is coming up May uh 19th through](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m36s)

[22nd. Uh at a minimum, you should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m41s)

[register because you get access to all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m44s)

[of the cool sessions and everything. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m46s)

[it is in Seattle. Um tickets are a bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m48s)

[on the spendy side. Uh, not even joking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m51s)

[on that. Um, if people would like to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m54s)

[in person, if anybody is going to be in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m57s)

[person, I will be there in person. So, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h00m59s)

[confirmed this week that I will be uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m02s)

[manning one of the uh booths in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m04s)

[experts exchange area underneath the uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m06s)

[thenet and dev tools section. So, uh I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m09s)

[a I'm not entirely clear on where that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m13s)

[is because this is going back to the uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m15s)

[not the new convention center in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m18s)

[Seattle, but the older one. So, I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m19s)

[never actually been to one there. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m23s)

[I'm not entirely clear what the layout](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m24s)

[looks like. So, more hopefully more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m26s)

[clarity on that as uh it gets closer.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m28s)

[So, I'm sure I'm going to get more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m31s)

[information about, you know, where I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m33s)

[supposed to stand and all kinds of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m34s)

[stuff. But, I always enjoy it. Um the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m36s)

[expert exchange sessions are are pretty](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m38s)

[much an opportunity for people to come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m40s)

[in and have kind of a one-on-one or a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m41s)

[oneto kind of discussion with people and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m43s)

[talking.net and dev tooling stuff. like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m47s)

[I absolutely love doing that and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m50s)

[Microsoft lets me go there and do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m53s)

[more which is even more awesome. So, uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m55s)

[I always enjoy that. I'm sure there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h01m58s)

[going to be plenty of stuff on uh AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m00s)

[agents. MCP is really hot right now. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m03s)

[Aspire is cool and we're going to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m06s)

[at some Aspire tonight. So, that'll be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m08s)

[even cooler. Okay, next thing. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m10s)

[Spokane.net user group. Hey, look me.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m12s)

[Um, I am speaking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m15s)

[uh I I was about to say next month, June](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m18s)

[3rd, so it's like six weeks away, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m21s)

[think, if I'm doing my math right. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m25s)

[this is going to be a very fun talk](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m28s)

[running through uh the different C](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m30s)

[versions and kind of the we'll call it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m33s)

[the highlights reel. Kind of like if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m35s)

[were to read a history book, how you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m37s)

[generally you like you get the the big](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m39s)

[events throughout, you know, different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m41s)

[areas of history. this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m43s)

[that only for C. Um I think a lot of it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m44s)

[because it's been around so long there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m48s)

[actually the concept of ancient history](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m50s)

[with C. I mean ancient and we're talking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m52s)

[you know decades not hundreds of years](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m55s)

[or thousands or whatever but in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m57s)

[case for a programming language that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h02m59s)

[ancient. So uh kind of going through the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m01s)

[the history of where we started kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m04s)

[explaining how we got some of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m07s)

[features that we did based upon how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m08s)

[things go because you know C# wasn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m10s)

[just hatched overnight. it it took years](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m12s)

[and years to get to where we're at now.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m14s)

[So, this is going to be a fun one. I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m17s)

[am thoroughly uh going to enjoy this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m19s)

[So, if you want, regardless of where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m22s)

[you're at, whether you're new to C or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m24s)

[somewhat experienced, I'm hoping there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m26s)

[going to be something there mildly new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m28s)

[to everybody at a at a bare minimum,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m30s)

[coming away with kind of a clear](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m32s)

[understanding of some of the features](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m34s)

[and the why behind all of it, I think,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m36s)

[is the the big the big goal I have here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m38s)

[And more importantly, it's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m40s)

[fun to to show off some cool C stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m42s)

[Um, yeah, and I intend to go all the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m45s)

[uh to C 14. So, for those people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m48s)

[confused, that's the version that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m51s)

[releases in November.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m53s)

[Now, there are preview bits and kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m55s)

[hints and the C lang is kind of showing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h03m58s)

[the direction that they're going. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m00s)

[some of that may end up being, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m01s)

[pseudo cody bits or like I may have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m03s)

[pull like a nightly build of the net or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m07s)

[something. So, we'll see. We'll see how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m09s)

[that goes. We'll see how far we can get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m10s)

[into that. But, I was going to cover all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m12s)

[the way back from the beginning all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m14s)

[way to theoretically the future because,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m16s)

[you know, June comes before November.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m18s)

[So, that will be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m20s)

[exciting. Okay. Okay. So, let's go. Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m22s)

[that's the wrong Visual Studio. That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m26s)

[what we were working on last time. Let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m28s)

[not look at that one. Let's not look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m30s)

[that one either. Hang on one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m32s)

[second. There we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m34s)

[go. This is what I want. Yeah. payment](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m36s)

[processing, but this is not what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m39s)

[going to look at. Okay, what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m40s)

[actually going to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m43s)

[at There we go. Okay, so couple things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m45s)

[So, I I know I've shown this solution](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m50s)

[off a handful of times, but I feel the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m53s)

[urge to show it off more. So, this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m55s)

[Net Aspire. So, for people who haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h04m59s)

[seen it, and I got to find the right got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m01s)

[to find a good tab to show this. We'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m05s)

[go here. Uh let's see. Net Aspire. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m07s)

[for people who haven't seen Oh, not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m10s)

[that. Just want the Aspire docs. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m12s)

[there. Just something simple. Just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m15s)

[something simple. So people who haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m17s)

[seen .NET Aspire before, this brings](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m19s)

[together a lot of different concepts.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m23s)

[Like some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m25s)

[Aspire is not new like but it bring but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m27s)

[it brings a lot of orchestration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m32s)

[together that that previously you kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m34s)

[of had to glue together yourself and it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m36s)

[wasn't always easy to make um happen. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m38s)

[there are a number of key things that uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m42s)

[go on here and I am not leveraging all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m45s)

[of Aspire. Aspire will go as far as to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m48s)

[um actually like build out your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m52s)

[infrastructure in Azure for you or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m53s)

[insert other cloud here. I think I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m55s)

[know. I know that they've been working](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h05m58s)

[on different things. I think at present](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m00s)

[it just builds out infrastructurees ARM](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m01s)

[but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m03s)

[am I am not trusting um and I like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m04s)

[darn it write my own Terraform myself.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m09s)

[So my infrastructure is done in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m10s)

[Terraform in a separate repo and I just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m12s)

[tell Aspire no you don't get to do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m14s)

[part. Um as much as I love you I love](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m16s)

[you not for that. So, but it does give](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m20s)

[this dev time orchestration and this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m23s)

[this is really really key like this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m25s)

[this is the this is the sweet spot in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m28s)

[opinion because normally when you've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m30s)

[kind of this um I don't want to say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m32s)

[microservices polyglot type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m35s)

[infrastructure you have to stand up a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m37s)

[lot of stuff locally to be able to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m39s)

[up and running. You'll note I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m41s)

[this fancy little icon. It's got a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m43s)

[little little purple little purple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m45s)

[triangle here for the Aspire logo and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m48s)

[it's and it's an app host. And you'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m50s)

[note this is my startup project and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m52s)

[will likely never change off of this as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m55s)

[my startup project. And if we look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m57s)

[its program CS, it is not fancy. It has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h06m58s)

[a I'm going to leave this guy visible](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m01s)

[for a second. It's using uh top level uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m03s)

[statements. So, uh, implicit mains, uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m08s)

[and it's got this distributed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m11s)

[application, create a builder. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m12s)

[you'll note in all of this stuff, I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m14s)

[just kind of tacking together all of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m16s)

[bits of the back end for Vellopac,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m18s)

[right? So, this is this is our backend](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m21s)

[SAS service that we've been uh, working](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m24s)

[on. And so, I've got storage stuff, I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m26s)

[got blob stuff, I've got Q's stuff. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m28s)

[I I run Azureite inside of a container](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m33s)

[to be able to uh have something that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m36s)

[simulates uh an Azure storage account](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m40s)

[locally inside of Docker, which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m42s)

[great. Um, I spin up a SQL server also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m44s)

[in Docker. And you'll note this with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m47s)

[lifetime persistent. I'll come back to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m49s)

[that in a moment. Uh, it adds in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m50s)

[database. And then more importantly, for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m53s)

[each of my services, I just tell it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m55s)

[which things it needs, right? My API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m57s)

[service is going to need pretty much,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h07m59s)

[you know, the backend blobs. It needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m02s)

[cues. It needs the database. But this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m03s)

[new partner API and this admin API that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m06s)

[we're looking at, they're only going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m08s)

[need access to the database themselves.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m09s)

[This is glorious because what this ends](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m12s)

[up doing, let's launch and show this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m14s)

[This is this this is just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m16s)

[awesome. And I am spilling Mountain Dew.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m19s)

[That's not a good sign. That is not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m22s)

[good sign if you're spilling Mountain](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m24s)

[Dew this early. Okay. Okay. Bippity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m25s)

[bopity booya. Come on. Launch. Do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m27s)

[thing. It does take it a mild. It does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m31s)

[take a quick hot minute to launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m34s)

[because, you know, it's got to do a few](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m36s)

[things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m37s)

[But aside from this unhandled exception](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m39s)

[occurred. What was that? Uh, collection](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m43s)

[was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m47s)

[modified. Huh, that's interesting. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m49s)

[So, you'll note this guy is fired up and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m53s)

[I now have a list of all of my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m56s)

[resources. I can see my SQL server is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m57s)

[apparently running but unhealthy, which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h08m59s)

[means I probably need to look at my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m02s)

[Docker container and figure out what the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m03s)

[heck, right? Worst case scenario, I just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m04s)

[torch the container and call it a day.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m07s)

[That's the beautiful thing about this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m09s)

[And you'll note it did come up and start](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m11s)

[running. My payment updator finished,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m12s)

[but it had three errors in the logs.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m14s)

[Great. I'm gonna ignore that for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m16s)

[because I'm fairly confident it's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m18s)

[fact that I don't have an updated key in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m20s)

[my user secrets and that's not something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m22s)

[I want to fix on stream. So, I'll do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m24s)

[that later. Plus, I don't care. But](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m25s)

[you'll note SQL Server database. I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m27s)

[got my storage. It's got blobs and cues](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m30s)

[under it. And then I've got a whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m32s)

[bunch of services and things running. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m33s)

[even have just a straight CLI executable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m34s)

[here, right? This is running the Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m37s)

[CLI because we use Stripe for payments.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m39s)

[And it's just like it's built up the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m41s)

[invocation and launched that. And if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m44s)

[want, I can just drop right in and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m47s)

[boom. Right. Don't worry, that's not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m49s)

[real secret in case you were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m52s)

[worried. So, this guy is fired up. We](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h09m56s)

[are off and running. We've got the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m00s)

[admin API, which is what uh the admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m02s)

[and partner API are the things I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m05s)

[work on. But I've also got these. You](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m07s)

[can see I've got hyperlinks out to to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m09s)

[and look at these. I can see the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m11s)

[console logs if I want. If I want to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m13s)

[structured logs, I can actually dive in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m15s)

[here and get fullon um uh infrastructure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m18s)

[level logging. Oh, it looks like the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m22s)

[errors that it flagged were likely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m25s)

[because I have two local databases and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m27s)

[they have different gooids for their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m30s)

[teams in them. What a shock. Um, but we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m31s)

[can we can actually dive in and take a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m34s)

[look at these traces and we can actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m36s)

[see a full trace of how long various](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m39s)

[things ended up taking, which is just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m42s)

[glorious. Um, so you get structured logs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m44s)

[and trace viewing through everything.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m47s)

[Um, you can pick which service you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m50s)

[interested in taking a look at. Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m52s)

[let's see. Console logs you can pull](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m54s)

[from any of the things. I'm only feeding](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m56s)

[structured logs from my my services](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h10m58s)

[because I don't think the other ones I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m01s)

[don't know how to configure them for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m03s)

[structured logging,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m04s)

[frankly. But yeah, all of those set up.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m06s)

[I've got metrics if I want to go through](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m09s)

[and figure out, oh, okay, let's figure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m10s)

[out, you know, how many open connections](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m12s)

[are running. one which I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m15s)

[with is probably my Aspire host but you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m18s)

[can pull back all of this kind of like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m20s)

[Prometheus level metric stuff which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m22s)

[just glory like you get all of this with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m24s)

[Aspire which is again you can plug all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m26s)

[these bits together if you want aside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m29s)

[from this pretty dashboard I don't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m31s)

[that any of this stuff was unattainable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m34s)

[before you just have to you had to build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m37s)

[all that glue yourself which sucked](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m39s)

[right nobody wants to do this other cool](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m41s)

[thing you can just arbitrarily stop](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m43s)

[stuff if you want, which is I I think a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m46s)

[newer feature of this dashboard. Um, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m47s)

[yeah, or restart one of these, which is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m51s)

[kind of cool because before I always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m53s)

[just come in and restart the entire app](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m55s)

[host, but now if you want to pick on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m56s)

[individual resources, you can get those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m57s)

[guys going too, which is very, very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h11m59s)

[slick. And all of this from being able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m03s)

[to build these up. Oh, I wanted to show](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m06s)

[off the so the admin API. All right.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m07s)

[Right. So, if I just click on this row](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m10s)

[here, you'll see that I've got all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m12s)

[this stuff set up and it's got ports and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m13s)

[whatnot exposed. But you'll note down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m16s)

[here because I said with reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m18s)

[database, I have a connection string for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m21s)

[my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m23s)

[database, right? Like this is this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m24s)

[very slick. And yes, you're about to see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m27s)

[a username and password. I'm not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m29s)

[worried. This is local only. You'd have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m30s)

[to have access to my Docker instance.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m32s)

[And if you have access to that, that's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m34s)

[different thing. Plus, it's going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m35s)

[cycle every time I reboot my container.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m36s)

[But you'll note when it spun that SQL](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m38s)

[Server Docker image, it dealt with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m41s)

[issue of being able to go through,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m43s)

[figure out what the connection string](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m45s)

[needed to look like, and then promptly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m48s)

[injected that into everywhere that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m50s)

[said reference my database. Right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m52s)

[Again, this is things you can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m54s)

[yourself, but spinning up a SQL server](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m56s)

[inside of Docker for you, pulling out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h12m59s)

[the connection string, setting that as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m01s)

[an environment variable as the startup](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m03s)

[for all these other projects, knowing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m05s)

[the dependency between them and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m07s)

[launching all of them. Like you can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m09s)

[all that like that's not like people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m10s)

[have built that kind of stuff already.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m13s)

[And you know, they've got multi-pro](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m15s)

[startups and scripts and various things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m16s)

[It's like great. But I pressed F5, which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m18s)

[is pretty slick. Absolutely absolutely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m21s)

[slick in my opinion. So, and then it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m25s)

[builds up all of this stuff and you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m27s)

[see I have I've got a little kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m28s)

[hacky thing going on here because my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m31s)

[front end code lives in a separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m33s)

[repository. So, I just go, you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m35s)

[what, if that repository is checked out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m37s)

[kind of alongside me, let's use it. npm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m39s)

[app off to the races. Away we go. Done.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m43s)

[Right. So, it's it's a little hacky](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m46s)

[because, you know, if the repository](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m48s)

[isn't checked out, I won't get a front](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m49s)

[end in my thing. Eh, not not a big deal,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m51s)

[right? That's that's at some point I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h13m57s)

[might try to do it because there there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m00s)

[a Aspire definitely pushes you a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m01s)

[bit towards a monor repo, right? And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m04s)

[there's a big debate monor repo, poly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m07s)

[repo, where should things live, how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m09s)

[should they be structured, yada yada](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m10s)

[yada. Like, you can do this any number](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m12s)

[of ways. This is the way I chose to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m15s)

[it. Okay. So, admin and partner API. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m19s)

[what is what is going on here? So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m24s)

[Bellipac backend SAS service. We want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m27s)

[be able to um effectively build out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m30s)

[sell uh this hosting solution for people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m34s)

[who are building your installers with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m37s)

[Vellopac. the the the SDK and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m39s)

[tooling that's out in the open source](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m42s)

[repo. It gets you far enough to where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m44s)

[it's got your app package. You got your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m46s)

[installers. It's got some upload](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m48s)

[commands to send it somewhere, but it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m50s)

[that that's kind of where it goes hands](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m52s)

[off. Basically, it points you in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m54s)

[right direction of where you need to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m55s)

[to upload stuff and then says, you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m57s)

[what, all that hosting stuff that's on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h14m58s)

[you. I'm not like I'm not helping you.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m00s)

[Um partly because that's kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m03s)

[complicated to do without some level of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m04s)

[ownership. So, it's like we put the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m07s)

[tools in the hands and then kind of back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m09s)

[off. But for people who kind of want a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m11s)

[uh a full solution, an end toend thing,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m13s)

[it's like well you help me get my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m16s)

[installer like now send it to my users](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m18s)

[please, right? That's where our SAS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m20s)

[comes in. That's where we are looking to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m22s)

[have uh a free there there's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m25s)

[I think three tiers when we when we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m27s)

[launch free dev and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m29s)

[pro pricing and ter stuff TBD um but we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m31s)

[have some people looking to potentially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m37s)

[partner with us and as part of that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m39s)

[wanted to have the the partners be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m42s)

[to effectively generate um coupon codes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m45s)

[right so that when when people buy stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m49s)

[from the partner. Um the partner can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m52s)

[offer them and say, "Hey, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m54s)

[we've got this making up numbers here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m55s)

[right? 40% off coupon for for Velopac if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h15m58s)

[you'd like to go and use them, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m02s)

[That way, uh they've got something nice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m04s)

[to offer their customers. We get people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m06s)

[in the door for us. Huzzah! Everyone's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m09s)

[happy, right? Maybe it's a free six](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m11s)

[months, whatever." Right? Details TBD.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m13s)

[But what that means is I need partners](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m17s)

[able to generate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m20s)

[coupons that will work on mine](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m22s)

[preferably. And this is where things are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m25s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m26s)

[get let me see if I can find my tab. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m27s)

[this is where things are going to get a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m31s)

[little bit interesting. So Stripe API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m33s)

[promotion code. So we're going to do a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m37s)

[little little rundown on how Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m39s)

[works.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m42s)

[So, Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m43s)

[has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m46s)

[coupons, right? And the coupon object](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m48s)

[and take all of the stripe take all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m51s)

[the sample object stuff on the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m54s)

[with a grain of salt as I've learned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m55s)

[with Stripe's documentation. It's like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m57s)

[95% there. And that other 5% really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h16m59s)

[messes me with me when it's wrong. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m02s)

[kind of annoying. Uh, and you'll note I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m04s)

[am in a test environment here. So, this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m07s)

[is not the production one. No one panic.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m10s)

[Um, so the coupon itself uh defines uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m13s)

[effectively the the discount, what it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m18s)

[applies to, you know, percent off, all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m20s)

[of that kind of stuff, right? So the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m23s)

[coupon defines the amount, where it goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m25s)

[to, but then the promotion code is what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m27s)

[actually gets shared um for what you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m31s)

[might enter, right? It's one of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m34s)

[types of codes here, right? And valid](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m36s)

[characters are lowerase, uppercase, and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m39s)

[digits. That's all you're allowed to do.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m41s)

[Um, and you can kind of make up whatever](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m44s)

[whatever you want to be. The only](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m46s)

[restriction is these things must be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m48s)

[unique across all active promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m50s)

[codes. So once you once you make one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m54s)

[these things, you can't do uh duplicate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m56s)

[it without uh without running into it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h17m59s)

[And I think the intent of what I would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m03s)

[like to do is I would like to have my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m05s)

[admin portal create the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m08s)

[coupon, generate uh an API key that the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m10s)

[partner can use. The partner can call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m14s)

[the partner API to get back a coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m16s)

[code that they can then hand to their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m19s)

[customers. That's what I think I want.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m21s)

[Right? That way there's there's some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m24s)

[level of control in that I'm the one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m25s)

[setting up the coupon. I know who I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m28s)

[handing out that API key to. I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m30s)

[authenticate the requests that come in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m32s)

[from it. Um, and if there's a, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m34s)

[a discussion that needs to have of, oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m37s)

[well, we would like the the coupon to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m39s)

[be, you know, different amount or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m41s)

[whatever, great, fine. We can have those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m42s)

[discussions, right? But then they can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m43s)

[generate the promotion code because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m46s)

[the thing that gets me is there's with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m47s)

[that because the people they're handing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m51s)

[this to may not have Velopac accounts, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m53s)

[can't tie it to anything in my system](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m56s)

[immediately, right? I've got nothing. As](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h18m58s)

[far as I'm concerned, the user doesn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m00s)

[exist.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m01s)

[So, all I can do is hand them this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m02s)

[promotion code um with potentially like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m04s)

[some number of redemptions uh that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m07s)

[could be redeemed on um some expiration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m10s)

[or similar and and we can you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m13s)

[negotiate what those things should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m15s)

[at. Obviously, it should probably come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m17s)

[back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m19s)

[uh uh as active to to make sure that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m20s)

[it's uh good to go. Um, but then being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m24s)

[able to hand that back so that they can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m27s)

[then include it in whatever manner makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m29s)

[sense to hand to their customers to say,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m31s)

["Here you go. Here's a wonderful, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m32s)

[know, coupon code that we generated,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m34s)

[yada yada yada, right?" And then if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m36s)

[there's ever a problem, something gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m38s)

[compromised, I can just either cycle the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m40s)

[coupon, I can cycle the key, whatever,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m41s)

[and everything just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m43s)

[works. That's what I think I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m45s)

[build. That's the game plan of what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m47s)

[have started on. Now obviously there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m49s)

[multiple levels of off that need to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m53s)

[on here and so inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m55s)

[my Vellopac stuff I have spun multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h19m58s)

[projects. So I have no fewer than three](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m02s)

[web API projects at the moment. So the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m06s)

[API service is kind of the main service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m09s)

[one that that does most of the stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m11s)

[around Vellopac flow. It's it's for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m13s)

[consumers, right? It supports the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m16s)

[front-end website. That's where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m18s)

[upload your releases. It backs the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m19s)

[website showing you your channels, your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m22s)

[release groups, all of that kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m23s)

[interesting stuff, right? That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m25s)

[fine. So, that's fine. That lives there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m27s)

[It gets to be fat, dumb, and happy,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m30s)

[right? But then I have the admin API,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m32s)

[which I want to So, the the API service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m34s)

[is using um MEL and Azure B2C um to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m37s)

[authenticate users, right? That way you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m42s)

[can log in with your Microsoft account,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m43s)

[your GitHub, your Google, right? Those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m45s)

[types of things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m47s)

[the admin API. I don't want to work that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m48s)

[way. I want it to off um based upon a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m52s)

[security group in our AD because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m55s)

[only people that should be hitting the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m57s)

[admin API are functionally people who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h20m58s)

[work for Velopac. That should be about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m02s)

[it. And really the admin API all it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m05s)

[going to have is the stuff to be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m07s)

[create create those uh partners. And I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m10s)

[say create partner, but it's really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m14s)

[creating a key that a partner can use to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m15s)

[access a coupon. And thank you for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m17s)

[follow, friends. We appreciate it. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m19s)

[and then the partner API is obviously](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m23s)

[then for the partner to call to generate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m24s)

[one of these suckers, right? That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m26s)

[where we're going, right? So on my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m28s)

[database, because I've already started](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m31s)

[this branch, so I'm off I'm off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m33s)

[pow-wowing. So we'll make this we'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m36s)

[make this bigger. I've got some basic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m38s)

[I've got some basic projects and a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m40s)

[little bit of stuff stubbed in. That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m42s)

[as far as I've got, just to be clear.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m43s)

[This is not working yet. Um, but we'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m45s)

[go through here and show. So, I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m48s)

[this partner coupon code that I'm going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m50s)

[to have in the database, right? There's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m51s)

[an API key, which I I I think we're just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m53s)

[going to basically do HMAC](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m55s)

[authentication all the way through. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m57s)

[think that makes it easiest, right? I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h21m59s)

[think so. We're going to roll with it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m02s)

[until I have a reason not to. Um, there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m04s)

[is going to be a name because, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m07s)

[I need to attach something useful. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m09s)

[then there will be a Stripe coupon ID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m11s)

[because all IDs from Stripe are in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m13s)

[there. Right? So that's in my that's in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m15s)

[my DB context. I've generated a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m17s)

[migration that that sets up the table](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m19s)

[and that's as far as this data project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m22s)

[goes. I thought about splitting this up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m24s)

[and going well, you know, maybe I should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m26s)

[have a separate DB context and split](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m28s)

[these out because these technically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m30s)

[don't need to be tied to the other one.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m31s)

[And then I realized Yagney Yagney](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m32s)

[Yagy don't do it till you have a reason](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m35s)

[to, right? like I don't I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m38s)

[anticipate this API getting flooded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m40s)

[specifically. It shouldn't get flooded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m43s)

[more than my public facing one. That](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m44s)

[should be the lion share of the traffic.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m47s)

[So it's like no no I'm not going to I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m49s)

[not going to spin a whole separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m52s)

[database with you know different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m54s)

[replicas and that kind of thing. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m56s)

[like not till I need it. So I put it all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h22m57s)

[here. I may need to break it later but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m00s)

[for now it's all going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m02s)

[together. And then just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m05s)

[for kind of some reference here, there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m07s)

[this velop pack service core. And for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m10s)

[anybody who spins up an Azure project,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m12s)

[um they they create what are the service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m16s)

[common I think is what they call it. I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m18s)

[renamed it, but one of the key things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m20s)

[that they have is this service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m23s)

[collection extensions where it basically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m24s)

[it's just a shared place to do all your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m27s)

[DI stuff, right? So it maps some health](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m29s)

[checks and set those up. Huzzah, all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m32s)

[that works, right? There's a bunch of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m34s)

[service defaults for building these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m36s)

[things up. Huzzah, all of that works,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m38s)

[right? I've got my top level thing for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m40s)

[just adding in all of my my Vellopac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m43s)

[services. This to-do comment is actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m45s)

[supposed to be here. Um I don't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m48s)

[that there's actually a cleaner way to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m51s)

[do this given order of operations, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m52s)

[you know what? I'm going to leave the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m54s)

[to-do there for now anyway. So, there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m55s)

[that. Okay. So, let's back up and let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h23m57s)

[let's take a look at admin API. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m01s)

[think we are fired up and running right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m04s)

[now, aren't we? Too many tabs. Too many](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m06s)

[tabs. Okay. So, admin API. Click here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m10s)

[Oh, this is one other thing that's worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m14s)

[noting. You'll note these links here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m15s)

[These are entirely powered by your I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m18s)

[shouldn't say entirely powered. By](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m22s)

[default, that's a better way of saying](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m23s)

[it. By default, these are just your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m25s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m28s)

[settings.json, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m29s)

[Uh yeah. So there's your launch URL and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m33s)

[how it picked up swagger was the fact](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m36s)

[that this is what it would launch if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m38s)

[were to run with F5 in my launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m41s)

[settings. So Aspire has gone, "Oh, those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m43s)

[are the default settings that you want.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m47s)

[Let me just go ahead and wire those up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m50s)

[for you." Again, love it. Love it. Love](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m51s)

[it. Love it. Love it. Um, so it gets us](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m55s)

[into here. We can authorize. I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h24m59s)

[authorize. Huzzah. Great. Right. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m02s)

[come in here. This is the weather](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m04s)

[forecast. I hit execute. Boom. I got a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m06s)

[200. We're cruising. Okay. So, mild](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m09s)

[amount of O without any real checking,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m14s)

[but I have O on the the admin service.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m16s)

[And we've got the default weather](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m20s)

[forecast, which is your ASP.N.ET core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m21s)

[out of the box doohickey stuff. Great.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m24s)

[Okay. So, admin API, we need to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m27s)

[through and build out uh an API endpoint](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m30s)

[that can spin a partner uh and it needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m33s)

[to take in a I think a string for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m36s)

[name of the partner and a string for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m40s)

[Stripe coupon code. At some point, we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m42s)

[may do some validation of it. We'll see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m45s)

[We'll see because I I'd like to see all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m47s)

[of that all of that work. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m50s)

[think yeah because I saw my other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m53s)

[service work, my user secrets should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m55s)

[set up for Stripe already. So I should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m57s)

[be good to go. Should be good to go. One](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h25m58s)

[other thing that I have done that I very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m01s)

[much love. So I have a directory build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m03s)

[props file and uh where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m06s)

[it? I this is one of the things that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m10s)

[you'll see if you look at my net](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m12s)

[templates repo. I enjoy putting my user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m14s)

[secrets in my directory build props.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m17s)

[Now, it is worth noting what this does.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m20s)

[This makes the sweeping assumption that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m22s)

[I want to share a single user secrets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m26s)

[file with all of my projects. This may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m28s)

[not be true for everybody because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m32s)

[might have, you know, two different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m35s)

[things that you're like, "Oh, shoot. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m36s)

[need an Azure ID section, but I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m38s)

[them different between these two](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m40s)

[services." If that's the case, this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m41s)

[not the solution for you. Just want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m43s)

[be clear. It may not work for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m45s)

[everybody, but it works really well](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m47s)

[because the number of times I get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m49s)

[annoyed of having to copy user secrets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m51s)

[from project A to project B to project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m53s)

[C, it's because if you just use the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m55s)

[built-in Visual Studio tooling, it'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m57s)

[generate you a separate GID for every](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h26m58s)

[project. Pro tip, you you can copy and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m00s)

[paste the GOID around, right? Like you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m04s)

[could have like if you were to put this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m06s)

[user secrets ID in three different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m08s)

[projects, all three of those projects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m10s)

[will share the same user secrets file.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m12s)

[If if there is reasonable sharing that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m14s)

[could happen between them, go ahead and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m17s)

[do it. Like the user secrets are local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m19s)

[user secrets. These aren't like shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m21s)

[out on the environments or whatever. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m24s)

[so don't copy and paste between user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m27s)

[secrets files like just share them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m30s)

[together where it makes sense. So that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m33s)

[is that is a lovely way of handling.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m36s)

[Okay. Boom.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m41s)

[So the other thing that I have done is I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m43s)

[have kind of structured a handful of my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m46s)

[APIs in the following way of kind of top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m48s)

[level groupings like what you might see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m51s)

[in swagger. So if we look at I look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m54s)

[the API here right for my my public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m57s)

[facing API you can see I've got API keys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h27m59s)

[I've got off I've got payments projects](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m01s)

[releases teams users right that's kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m04s)

[of my top level thing and you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m06s)

[I'm I'm versioning my APIs now I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m09s)

[have an API sitting in front of this or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m12s)

[or any of that nature yet right again](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m15s)

[this is one of those I had to go yagnney](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m18s)

[yagny yagnney stand it up once you have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m20s)

[a justification for needing it. For now,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m23s)

[we're just doing versioning uh within](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m26s)

[the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m28s)

[itself. For now, it works just fine. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m30s)

[don't have an issue. I may have an issue](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m33s)

[in the future and I will address it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m34s)

[then. So, for the admin API, we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m36s)

[going to go with uh I think partner is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m40s)

[pro. Oh, I need to let's leave it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m43s)

[running though. Let's detach that way it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m45s)

[doesn't kill it. Okay. So, let's call it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m48s)

[partner, right? Right. And inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m52s)

[each of these, I've kind of done this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m54s)

[thing where I put an extension which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m56s)

[does the mapping of the endpoints and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h28m57s)

[then uh the the V1 to be able to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m00s)

[through and handle this. It's just kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m04s)

[of the structure that I decided that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m05s)

[liked. Uh and so I am going to continue](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m07s)

[it because you know what it worked well](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m10s)

[the first time. So we're going to keep](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m12s)

[going with that. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m13s)

[uh partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m16s)

[extensions. Great. And this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m20s)

[end up being a static class because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m22s)

[we're going to do this sort of thingy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m24s)

[mabobber here. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m26s)

[kind of just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m28s)

[grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m30s)

[this and bring it in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m32s)

[here. And so map](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m35s)

[um I am also using minimal APIs. Um part](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m40s)

[of this project was I was like you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m43s)

[what minimal APIs look cool I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m44s)

[try them. So I did. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m47s)

[see partners and then so this is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m52s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m56s)

[be trying to decide if I want it if this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h29m59s)

[should be pluralized or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m03s)

[not. I don't think so. We're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m08s)

[with this. Okay. Uh make sure they all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m10s)

[require O. And then the question](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m14s)

[becomes, I probably want to a list. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m17s)

[probably want a get. I probably want a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m20s)

[create. I don't know if I want an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m22s)

[update. I think we're going to end up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m25s)

[with just a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m27s)

[delete. I suppose there might be an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m28s)

[argument for an update for like the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m31s)

[name. Yeah, we'll we'll leave an update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m33s)

[in there. And then the rest of these I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m36s)

[don't think are going to matter for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m38s)

[me. We're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m39s)

[just we're just going to whack all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m42s)

[those.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m44s)

[Okay. Okay. So, now we need inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m45s)

[here, we're going to go add new folder.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m48s)

[We're going to do a V1 and we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m51s)

[to do what did I call the ones down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m53s)

[here? Just methods. Yeah. So, it's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m55s)

[to be partner methods inside of here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m57s)

[Add new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h30m58s)

[class. Partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m01s)

[methods. And this becomes a static](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m04s)

[class. And then everywhere I have this,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m07s)

[we're going to go here. We're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m11s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m13s)

[with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m14s)

[methods. Uh, let's see. Let's replace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m16s)

[all in here. It's control](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m19s)

[A. Alt A. That's why it wasn't working.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m21s)

[Okay. Thank you. And then we go here. We](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m25s)

[go bring that sucker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m28s)

[in. Get rid of you. There we go. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m30s)

[So, uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m34s)

[Update. Partner. And then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m51s)

[delete partner. There we go. Huzzah.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m54s)

[Huzzah. Huzzah. And then I need my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h31m58s)

[routes. My routes. My routes. My routes.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m01s)

[Where did I put these? I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m03s)

[remember. Oh, right at the bloody](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m05s)

[bottom. Yeah. So I just want that part](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m08s)

[of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m10s)

[it. And then I would like team routes to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m14s)

[become let's see this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m19s)

[be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m23s)

[partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m25s)

[routes. We go that updates all of those.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m28s)

[And then everywhere I have the word team](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m32s)

[we're going to replace with the word](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m36s)

[partner. Probably could have done that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m37s)

[at the beginning and saved myself some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m40s)

[effort. That's going to get me pretty](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m43s)

[darn close to what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m45s)

[want. So, aside from the fact that none](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m48s)

[of these things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m50s)

[work and we might have to refactor some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m52s)

[stuff, but that's okay. That is okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m55s)

[That is what we do. Okay,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h32m57s)

[gen all of these things up.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m00s)

[um going to have to look at some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m06s)

[those methods that are not resolving are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m08s)

[extensions and things that I've built.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m10s)

[So, we may have to we may have to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m12s)

[things in. I've got a shared library](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m14s)

[where that all of these projects are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m16s)

[referencing that we can pull those into.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m17s)

[And let's just verify that I have it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m20s)

[referenced. Uh this guy is referencing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m22s)

[none of my projects. So, let's let's fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m24s)

[that real quick because service core is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m26s)

[absolutely something we want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m30s)

[reference.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m31s)

[because that's where the shared stuff's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m34s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m36s)

[go. Uh, okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m37s)

[So, partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m41s)

[ID. I just want these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m43s)

[lowercased. I know my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m46s)

[my find and replace did that to me. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m48s)

[I'm going to just clean that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m51s)

[up. Okay. Okay. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m54s)

[just go into here and let's take a look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h33m56s)

[at choir team member. What was what's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m01s)

[this extension here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m04s)

[doing?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m06s)

[Um, this is adding a policy. And I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m11s)

[think I'm going to need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m15s)

[here. Uh, nope. That's the wrong one. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m19s)

[don't need I don't need that here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m23s)

[because authorization is going to be if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m25s)

[you can authorize against this service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m28s)

[you're going to be good to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m30s)

[go I think is the way this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m32s)

[work. Uh let's see let's make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m36s)

[public public. It doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m41s)

[for the purposes of testing because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m44s)

[way we're going to test this is more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m47s)

[from a functional standpoint. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m49s)

[I I use a web application factory to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m53s)

[stand up an in-memory instance of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m56s)

[service so that it can test the full](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h34m57s)

[middleware. Now because if you just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m02s)

[invoke like your your minimal API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m04s)

[methods directly or you invoke your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m06s)

[controller methods if you're you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m08s)

[going that route with your ASP.NET core.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m10s)

[Um, like that's fine for testing the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m12s)

[code within the method, but you've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m14s)

[skipped all of that middleware and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m17s)

[routing and stuff that that leads to a a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m19s)

[request making it to that method.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m22s)

[Whereas, if you stand up a web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m25s)

[application factory, you can validate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m26s)

[things like routing is set up the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m27s)

[you expect. More importantly, the tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m29s)

[then serve as a really nice place to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m31s)

[show off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m34s)

[uh what the capabilities of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m36s)

[uh your methods are. What are you?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m39s)

[There's an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m42s)

[update. I have to have it yesterday at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m47s)

[11:04. You can tell I haven't been on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m50s)

[this machine since yesterday at 11:04.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m52s)

[Uh because I would have definitely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m54s)

[installed that update if I had seen it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m56s)

[then. I'll leave the bell. I'll grab it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m57s)

[later.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h35m59s)

[Okay, so we need the uh what namespace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m02s)

[was I putting my request classes in? Are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m06s)

[these all off in the models? Yeah, we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m08s)

[going to go here and I'm going to do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m10s)

[same same kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m12s)

[pattern. Um and I've been versioning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m15s)

[these models, which are effectively the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m18s)

[the Poco request responses.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m20s)

[um with the intent that if I need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m23s)

[change something because once this goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m25s)

[live um I've got snapshot tests around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m27s)

[my my swagger uh open API spec so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m30s)

[there should be no breaking API changes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m34s)

[that I am unaware of like you have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m37s)

[explicitly make a change to that test in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m39s)

[order for it to go through. It's a very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m42s)

[obnoxious test and annoys the living](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m43s)

[daylights out of me. Um but that is okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m45s)

[because that is exactly what we want,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m47s)

[right? is I want to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m50s)

[annoyed. Uh, partner CS. Yeah, we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m53s)

[going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m56s)

[here and then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h36m57s)

[just boom. Create Stop it. Stop](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m00s)

[it. Create partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m06s)

[request. Do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m08s)

[need component models here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m11s)

[So because that'll get that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m16s)

[working and then this should resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m18s)

[great and then I need my validate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m21s)

[function. This might need to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m23s)

[because this lives up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m27s)

[in oh yep it lives up in my validation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m30s)

[layer which is which is wonderful except](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m35s)

[that I can't then reference it in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m38s)

[other service where I want it. Um, but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m40s)

[don't want to move the whole file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m43s)

[because some of these things are very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m44s)

[explicit about what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m46s)

[want. Yeah, I think what we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m48s)

[do is we are going to just move the bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m51s)

[that we care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m53s)

[about. Let's go down to service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m54s)

[core and let's give me a validation name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h37m57s)

[space. Don't know what I clicked. Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m01s)

[nougat. Nope, not what we need here. Add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m03s)

[folder validation. Gonna go here, here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m07s)

[here. Stop it. Stop helping me. Thank](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m12s)

[annoyed with this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m18s)

[validation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m21s)

[extensions. And then I need this lovely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m23s)

[guy. Come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m27s)

[here. This is probably going to break a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m29s)

[handful of things. Public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m31s)

[static. And that's also why you won't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m34s)

[see explicit unit tests on some of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m36s)

[methods because I'm because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m38s)

[validating it by hitting the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m40s)

[uh inside of an in-memory instance. It](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m44s)

[makes it so much easier for me to um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m47s)

[ensure that all of these things just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m52s)

[work. Uh let's see. Get validation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m54s)

[errors. I think that's in here. I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h38m57s)

[wants a collection that it can add to.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h39m21s)

[Great, great, great, great, great. Okay,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h39m22s)

[Okay, so that gets me to there. What is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h42m47s)

[your problem with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h42m49s)

[this? Interesting. I wonder if this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h42m55s)

[um I don't think we need this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m02s)

[So, we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m05s)

[may let's see we're not going to require](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m08s)

[authenticate against this API, you're an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m13s)

[admin. So the jig is up at that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m15s)

[point, which is why we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m20s)

[lock it down with the security group and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m22s)

[not let bad people into the security](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m31s)

[member and then we need update partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m37s)

[update partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h43m43s)

[better or worse it like I talk out loud](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m27s)

[when I code. Um, and anybody who uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m30s)

[needs to hear the phrase, I don't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m34s)

[have to spell duck with a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m45s)

[U. For anyone who needs it, if for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m48s)

[anyone who's like, "Oh, that sounds so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m50s)

[weird to talk out loud about your code."](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m52s)

[This this is a safe way to do it. You](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m54s)

[can talk to a duck instead. Uh at my uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h44m56s)

[day job, I literally have a large rubber](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m02s)

[duck sitting on my desk and it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m05s)

[wonderful. And talking out loud, it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m08s)

[remarkable how many times that that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m11s)

[solves your problem, right? Just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m14s)

[literally take your hands off the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m16s)

[keyboard and just describe the problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m18s)

[out loud. Some people do it and they do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m20s)

[it in a more socially acceptable way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m22s)

[where they like walk up to a whiteboard](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m24s)

[and they like grab a pen and they hold](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m26s)

[it in their hand and they spend the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m27s)

[whole time talking without actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m28s)

[writing on the whiteboard and so it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m30s)

[feels more socially acceptable to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m31s)

[that. Some people prefer their ducks to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m33s)

[be humans but the person they're talking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m35s)

[to doesn't actually even need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m37s)

[respond. They just want to explain it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m38s)

[Works wonderful. Works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m40s)

[wonderful. So when in doubt, find](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m44s)

[yourself a duck. Uh let's see. I need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m46s)

[know I so I think we're going to go GID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m50s)

[ID and then I think we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m55s)

[string name because I don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m57s)

[there's anything I think if I needed to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h45m58s)

[update anything other than the name on a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m01s)

[partner I would just delete and create a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m04s)

[new one because at that point it it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m07s)

[might as well be a new one. Like I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m08s)

[I don't think I want to do a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m10s)

[editing of like the data inside of it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m12s)

[because even though I've called these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m15s)

[things partners and maybe I shouldn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m16s)

[call them partners. They're really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m18s)

[make mistakes. Yeah, we're going to call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m42s)

[it partner promotion code. I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m44s)

[that I think that it's long and wordy,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m47s)

[but I'm the only one who has to look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m51s)

[the long wordy name. We're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h46m53s)

[functions, they'll be a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h47m00s)

[different. So, we might actually go back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h47m03s)

[him](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h50m57s)

[up. I have done something different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h50m58s)

[between these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m00s)

[two. Uh okay, so this needs to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m02s)

[renamed.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m04s)

[endpoint vention builder.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m23s)

[Oh, it's this guy that's landing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m29s)

[on Oh, that's dirty. That's dirty. Okay,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m32s)

[so I'll show you I'll show you what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m37s)

[see. Right.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m38s)

[So, this this is one of the best](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m40s)

[slashworth things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m43s)

[of minimal APIs is there there's there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m45s)

[enough kind of weird conventiony stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m48s)

[around this that it's not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m51s)

[always not always obvious. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m53s)

[we're going to I'm just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m56s)

[collapse some of this up and clean up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m57s)

[the the debugging that I did and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h51m59s)

[I'll we'll walk through this. So, so on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m01s)

[the right we'll we'll we'll pick on like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m05s)

[the list one, right? Because this is as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m06s)

[simple as it gets, right? When I hover](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m10s)

[over map get, you'll note something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m12s)

[here, right? This the return type here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m14s)

[is route handler builder, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m16s)

[Endpoint route builder map get delegate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m20s)

[handler, right? If we come over here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m23s)

[hover on it, you'll note we've landed on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m26s)

[a different](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m28s)

[overload, right? And you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m32s)

[specifically this is a request delegate.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m34s)

[This is the overload that's different,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m37s)

[right? So that's what's biting me. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m40s)

[the reason it's biting me is because if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m42s)

[we go over and look at this guy, this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m44s)

[guy was declared something like this,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m46s)

[which is fine, right? If we were to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m48s)

[at, and I think if I F12 on here, I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m50s)

[get to it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m53s)

[Right? If I come in here and take a look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m54s)

[at this, if I look at a request](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m56s)

[delegate, a request delegate is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h52m58s)

[delegate type that is task returning and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m01s)

[takes in a single HTTP context. When I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m04s)

[told the IDE and I was just, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m07s)

[control period generate me a method.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m10s)

[Generate me a method. Well,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m11s)

[unfortunately, it looked at this and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m13s)

[went, well, all I see is map get, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m15s)

[don't know which of the overloads you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m17s)

[want. I'm just going to pick what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m18s)

[presume to be the first one which was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m20s)

[the request delegate and I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m22s)

[generate you something that matches](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m23s)

[that. Right? So if we come here, right,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m24s)

[and I change specifically this one up,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m27s)

[right? So this is request delegate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m30s)

[syntax. If I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m32s)

[this, magically it now works. Right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m35s)

[Deleting the HTTP context out of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m39s)

[parameter set now means that I resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m43s)

[to a different overload. specifically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m46s)

[one that is a delegate type overload.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m48s)

[Right? That didn't grab well. Right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m52s)

[Delegate type overload which returns a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m55s)

[route handler builder which now works.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h53m57s)

[Right? So the short version is I trusted](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m00s)

[the too much in the IDE uh and it hosed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m03s)

[me and we really don't need the HTTP](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m07s)

[context in any of these things. So we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m10s)

[just not going to use it anywhere. Boom.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m12s)

[Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m16s)

[should now update. Boom. We now land on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m18s)

[the appropriate overload. Off to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m21s)

[races. Huzzah. Right. Overload](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m22s)

[resolution. If you do like minimal APIs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m25s)

[where there's a lot of this method group](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m27s)

[kind of function mapping stuff, it's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m30s)

[good idea to to pay very very close](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m32s)

[attention because oftent times with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m36s)

[delegates and method groups, the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m38s)

[compiler has to infer which overload](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m40s)

[you're doing based on the parameters.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m42s)

[And that's not always like you'll note I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m44s)

[didn't change any lines of code here. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m47s)

[even though the red squiggle was here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m49s)

[the fix was somewhere else. So it's it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m51s)

[one of those things that you just have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m54s)

[to uh be very uh diligent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m55s)

[about. Okay. Now we go here. Now we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h54m59s)

[here. And I'm going to close some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m03s)

[these things up. I've got too much open.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m04s)

[See, I cannot tolerate those things. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m06s)

[I'm going to just take this guy and I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m08s)

[going to put him off to the side. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m10s)

[we're going to need a couple of things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m12s)

[So with with minimal APIs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m13s)

[uh let's see I do not like the order it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m16s)

[put these things in. We I like these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m18s)

[methods to be in the order in which they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m21s)

[existed. So with minimal APIs you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m23s)

[actually do strongly typed uh response](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m26s)

[codes like this like there's an okay a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m29s)

[not found etc etc etc. and we'll get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m31s)

[down to doing multiple like there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m34s)

[results class for when an API might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m35s)

[return multiple different response](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m38s)

[codes, right? So you can kind of in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m39s)

[case it's going to return an okay or a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m42s)

[not found whereas a list endpoint it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m44s)

[just going to like it's going to return](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m46s)

[an okay and this is from this method](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m48s)

[itself, right? There's middleware higher](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m51s)

[up that's doing off and other things. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m52s)

[like 401's and those types of things are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m55s)

[still possible earlier in the food](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m57s)

[chain. But at this point once you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h55m58s)

[we're we're off we're in we've got a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m00s)

[user right and we're doing this work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m02s)

[listing the stuff there's there's really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m05s)

[just the one right so we're going to end](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m07s)

[up in a similar situation here and we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m08s)

[going to need a list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m11s)

[uh and I think we're going to change the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m14s)

[name of this method because we changed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m20s)

[um I'm kind of thinking that what we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m23s)

[going to do is I want to because I added](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m25s)

[promotion codes here. I think I'm going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m28s)

[to rename this to partner promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m30s)

[methods. Just uh would you also like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m34s)

[rename? Yes. Yes, I would. Thank you.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m37s)

[That way it's that way it's a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m40s)

[more clear, right? Again, this extension](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m41s)

[may shell out to different classes, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m44s)

[for now, this is where the promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m46s)

[codes go. And you know, I may break out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m48s)

[partner into its own group and blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m50s)

[blah.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m52s)

[deal with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m52s)

[that because we may nest this this stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m53s)

[in a little bit, but we want to want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m56s)

[stay consistent. Okay, but for my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h56m58s)

[models, I need a list response. I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m00s)

[going to just go down here and blatantly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m02s)

[steal from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m06s)

[my my thingyama bobber because this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m07s)

[is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m11s)

[here. Do something like this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m13s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m16s)

[partner promotion code list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m19s)

[response.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m23s)

[Um trying to decide what we what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m28s)

[return back here because the other one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m31s)

[here, right, we're returning a team or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m33s)

[it's going to be something like this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m35s)

[Like we can start here, but this is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m36s)

[is vastly off, right? So it probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m38s)

[should be a partner promotion code is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m41s)

[the appropriate type. It's going to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m44s)

[an ID. It's going to have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m45s)

[name. But now the question is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m47s)

[I I think I can return the Stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m51s)

[code as part of it. There's nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m54s)

[overly secret about that. Having that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m56s)

[doesn't get you anything. But I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h57m58s)

[for the API code, I don't want that in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m00s)

[the list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m03s)

[response. In fact, we may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m06s)

[not we may only want to return it when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m08s)

[we create it. We do something similar](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m11s)

[for the API keys when we generate them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m13s)

[is they don't like you don't get them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m15s)

[back. You get them once and that's it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m18s)

[After that, they're locked away in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m20s)

[database and your choices delete and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m22s)

[recreate. I think we're going to follow](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m23s)

[a similar pattern here. I think that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m25s)

[makes a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m28s)

[sense. Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m29s)

[here. And I think we slap an S on that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m32s)

[and call it a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m34s)

[day. Uh great. That gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m36s)

[That gets me to there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m40s)

[So, we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m42s)

[here. List](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m43s)

[uh what did I just call that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m48s)

[thing? Oh, partner promotion codes list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m51s)

[response. Got it. Right. So, you got to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m54s)

[got to name it properly. Okay. There's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m57s)

[that. And then we are going to need a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h58m59s)

[uh Velopac context. Uh I think I just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m02s)

[have been calling this context](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m07s)

[elsewhere. And this is where we get need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m08s)

[to pull it back out. So, this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m10s)

[actually going to be very similar to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m13s)

[teams one. And we can get away with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m15s)

[some Oh, let's not do let's not look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m20s)

[teams. Let's look at the API key ones. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m23s)

[think those ones might be a slightly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m25s)

[better. Let's create. Yeah, because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m29s)

[think we can get away with just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m32s)

[effectively doing the same thing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m34s)

[Don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m38s)

[care. Don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m39s)

[care. There we go. Putting. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m42s)

[this is going to be partner coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m45s)

[codes. We don't care about this. This is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m47s)

[going to be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m51s)

[uh partner promotion code. Oh, we should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m54s)

[re We're going to have to rename the D.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=00h59m57s)

[That's gonna be fun. H. We'll do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m01s)

[with that. That deal with that in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m03s)

[minute. Uh, and then I do want a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m05s)

[cancellation token,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m06s)

[uh, because I'd like to be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m09s)

[cancel this. And then we've got ID,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m11s)

[name, and then it's going to be X.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m14s)

[Stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m17s)

[ID,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m19s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m22s)

[Um, see, the other one was a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m26s)

[constructor. This one was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m28s)

[named. Guess it doesn't really matter.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m31s)

[doesn't really make a big difference one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m34s)

[way or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m36s)

[another.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m36s)

[Uh that do that do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m40s)

[that because EF Core is okay with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m47s)

[this for their uh projection the select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m52s)

[method here. And then this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m56s)

[require including the entity framework](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h00m58s)

[core. This is pulling out an array](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m00s)

[uh partner promotion list response and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m05s)

[then this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m07s)

[becomes partner promotion codes. We](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m08s)

[rename](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m11s)

[this partner promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m12s)

[codes because this really is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m17s)

[dump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m20s)

[everything. Is there a benefit to soft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m22s)

[delete versus hard delete?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m25s)

[I don't think so. I don't think I have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m32s)

[reason to save for soft delete. So, we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m34s)

[are literally going to be dumping all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m36s)

[the records out of this table, but this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m38s)

[table is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m40s)

[be small. So, just to be clear,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m41s)

[generally hitting a a DB set and just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m45s)

[blindly pulling everything out into an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m48s)

[array. This is a recipe for disaster. Do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m50s)

[not do this on any table that might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m54s)

[grow. Right? In this case, it's gonna be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h01m56s)

[a small one, so I'm not going to worry](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m00s)

[about it. Yagy, yagny, yagny. Not until](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m02s)

[I need it. Not until I need it. Uh, and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m05s)

[so for now, that gets me there. Great.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m08s)

[Okay. Next, we need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m11s)

[um we need the create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m15s)

[method. I think that was right here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m17s)

[Create API key request. So, we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m21s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m22s)

[do do effectively the same thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m25s)

[here. Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m28s)

[create partner promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m31s)

[request. At some point, I have grand](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m36s)

[dreams of building myself Oh, I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m39s)

[already got one. of building myself a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m41s)

[source generator because a lot of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m43s)

[things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m45s)

[are they're very very like there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m47s)

[very clearcut pattern here. Um it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m50s)

[actually got to be careful how I phrase](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m55s)

[this. So there's a there's a cool thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h02m57s)

[my company builds](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m00s)

[uh so if anybody is interested](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m09s)

[this thing called](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m11s)

[coales. Um, so for anybody who does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m13s)

[ASP.NET, so this is ASP.NET](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m17s)

[uh web API backend. So C uh with Vue3](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m21s)

[front end, right? So if that sounds like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m25s)

[you, this thing is pretty freaking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m28s)

[sweet. Um, effectively it like where I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m33s)

[kind of building out these middle tier](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m37s)

[layers of of doing it. It will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m39s)

[generate everything from your D like it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m41s)

[takes your DB context and its models as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m44s)

[its input and it will generate you the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m47s)

[controllers and everything all the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m49s)

[out to the front end and give you like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m51s)

[refresh stuff. So it lets you build a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m53s)

[lot of this stuff very very quickly. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m56s)

[and then you have to basically decorate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h03m59s)

[your your EF models with uh annotations](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m01s)

[or methods or similar for when you want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m04s)

[to do custom stuff. But functionally it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m05s)

[lets you either focus on the back end uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m08s)

[and how the the and do the data modeling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m12s)

[and figure out the relationships there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m14s)

[or the front end of you know making it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m16s)

[pretty figuring out the UI UX and not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m18s)

[stressing too much about the middle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m20s)

[stuff in between. So if that sounds cool](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m22s)

[to you check it out. There is also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m25s)

[there's a pretty slick site for it too,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m27s)

[anybody who wants it. Um, I also have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m30s)

[video on my my YouTube where I sit down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m33s)

[with uh Grant and Andrew,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m36s)

[the I have creators, founders. There's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m38s)

[been a number of people that have worked](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m41s)

[on it over the years, but um those two I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m42s)

[think are are generally considered the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m45s)

[the big brains on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m47s)

[it. Uh, okay. So, I want this as my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m49s)

[input to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m55s)

[create quest. And we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m57s)

[take a quick look here. And then I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h04m59s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m03s)

[need probably going to need both of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m04s)

[these. And this is where we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m06s)

[end up having to do a little bit of of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m07s)

[fun stuff because I want to gen this not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m10s)

[too unlike how I did the I'm leaving the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m14s)

[clock the time provider for the clock in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m16s)

[here because I know I'm going to need it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m18s)

[very similar because this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m21s)

[not too unlike how we gen the API keys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m23s)

[except for you know this won't be an API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m26s)

[key. So this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m28s)

[a partner coupon code. Oh man, I just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m31s)

[want to rename it. I'm going to do it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m34s)

[right now.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m35s)

[Partner promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m39s)

[code. Well, is coupon code right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m47s)

[Because in the database, it's not it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m50s)

[not the promotion code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m52s)

[itself. It's not actually that. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m55s)

[it's going to end up being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h05m58s)

[a you know promote coupon code might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m01s)

[right because this re this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m03s)

[be the information about the coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m05s)

[that's used to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m07s)

[generate the promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m12s)

[code. Yeah, I think we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m16s)

[with I think I think coupon code's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m19s)

[to be fine. We're going to go with that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m21s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m23s)

[uh uh coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m27s)

[code. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m31s)

[need Hey, Aerys, thank you for the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m36s)

[follow. I appreciate it. Let's see. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m38s)

[we're going to go with request name is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m41s)

[that's just going to be an arbitrary](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m44s)

[string where you can like list the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m46s)

[partner or the promo or something about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m48s)

[the coupon or whatever. And then this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m50s)

[where we're going to need to separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m52s)

[some stuff is I want some of this API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m53s)

[key](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m56s)

[stuff. Um, but I want it but I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h06m57s)

[want like I need it out of this thingy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m00s)

[bober. We're not setting expiration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m03s)

[dates on these. That's another key](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m05s)

[difference here. And we're not linking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m07s)

[them out. And then this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m09s)

[the Stripe coupon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m12s)

[ID. Request stripe coupon ID. Okay. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m14s)

[this is going to get me to here. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m17s)

[this is going to get me to partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m18s)

[coupon codes. We might just go fix the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m20s)

[database here in a second because this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m22s)

[is going to this is going to bother me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m23s)

[having this called. Well, if this makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m25s)

[sense for partner coupon code, this also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m28s)

[makes sense for partner coupon. Never](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m30s)

[mind. We're not going to change it. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m31s)

[going to be great. It's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m32s)

[perfectly great. Okay. And then this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m33s)

[uh this is the details to route to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m42s)

[somewhere else. Uh, we can't. Oh, that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m46s)

[the wrong button. That is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m50s)

[wrong. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m53s)

[What? What? What is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h07m57s)

[on? Shift down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m02s)

[arrow has started moving this. Wait, how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m06s)

[do I do my block edit then?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m10s)

[Windows that moves line shift alt. Okay,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m15s)

[shift alt. Okay, I was very confused for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m18s)

[a moment. There we go. Block edits.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m21s)

[We're good. Okay, so we need to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m23s)

[this API key generate function. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m26s)

[needs to live somewhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m28s)

[else. Why did I think I needed the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m30s)

[clock? Thought I needed it in here for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m34s)

[something, but I guess not. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m37s)

[we're going to move.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m39s)

[We'll drop you as a parameter. And this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m42s)

[is the other nice part about the minimal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m44s)

[API is it figures it out, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m45s)

[So there's a handful of things that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m49s)

[just knows how to populate for you. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m51s)

[like the DB context because it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m55s)

[obviously not going to find that on like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m57s)

[the body or the route. It go it knows to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h08m59s)

[go, oh, I'll grab that from your DI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m02s)

[container and I'll populate that for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m03s)

[you. Cancellation token. This is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m04s)

[something that comes through from the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m06s)

[middleware in case the uh upstream call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m07s)

[gets uh terminated. There's your token.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m09s)

[Done. This comes in on the body.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m12s)

[Done. Easy mode. Easy, easy, easy mode.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m16s)

[Okay. Um, and then this guy here on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m21s)

[create. This is going to be create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m24s)

[route. And we kind of need to go build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m27s)

[out the the the get first before we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m30s)

[before we get too carried away because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m34s)

[this is going to be this guy.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m36s)

[Maybe we go build this guy out and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m39s)

[come back. So that's probably what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m42s)

[should do next. So let's do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m44s)

[that. Uh get API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m46s)

[key going to look similar to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m49s)

[this. So get partner is going to look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m53s)

[real similar to get API key. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h09m58s)

[then the question comes, I think we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m01s)

[don't return anything](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m04s)

[different here on a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m07s)

[single. Just return the singular one.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m10s)

[That makes me question the difference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m12s)

[between having both of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m14s)

[these. We're going to we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m17s)

[it like that for now and we'll consider](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m18s)

[the differences later. Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m21s)

[And it needs an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m23s)

[ID. Uh, it's going to need a handful of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m25s)

[things. So, it's going to need most of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m28s)

[this, right? Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m30s)

[uh what did I call this? Partner ID. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m34s)

[it's important that this name here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m38s)

[you will get yelled at.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m40s)

[Um but in this case, because the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m43s)

[uh this is the API key](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m47s)

[one up this one here. Uh this get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m52s)

[partner. This partner ID needs to match,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m56s)

[right? In order for it to to make it all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h10m59s)

[the way into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m01s)

[here. Uh, we aren't going to have a user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m03s)

[context, but we do need a DB context.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m05s)

[And we've got a token. Great. Great.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m07s)

[Great. Great. And then we're going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m09s)

[something similar to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m11s)

[this, except](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m13s)

[for let's see, we're going to have one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m20s)

[of these. And this is the beauty of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m24s)

[using the strongly typed result ones is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m26s)

[you can't accidentally return the wrong](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m28s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m30s)

[anymore. And then it's squawking at me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m31s)

[because uh actually I think what we can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m34s)

[just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m37s)

[do need to make sure we're hitting that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m41s)

[Yeah. So I can just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m44s)

[do rather than two array we can just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m49s)

[first or default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m52s)

[async partner promotion code and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m54s)

[this guy literally just becomes partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h11m58s)

[promotion code but this doesn't handle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m01s)

[the not found case right so that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m03s)

[that's no bueno so we got to handle that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m05s)

[as well because this is a first or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m07s)

[default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m09s)

[um we need a wear to make sure that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m10s)

[actually you get the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m14s)

[one. Actually, we can get away with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m18s)

[doing this here, right? Because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m20s)

[Yeah, you take the predicate. So, we can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m23s)

[rather than doing a wear, we can just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m25s)

[come down here and go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m26s)

[um I actually like the way that reads](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m31s)

[better. This feels more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m33s)

[SQLy, right? It feels It feels better to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m35s)

[me. I think they probably generate the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m39s)

[same SQL but me again small table not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m41s)

[going to stress too much about it. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m46s)

[this order of operations feels nicer to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m47s)

[me. Okay. So if uh partner promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m49s)

[code is null type result not found.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m54s)

[Done. And then sure you want to turn](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m57s)

[area. Yeah. Fine. We can that just looks](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h12m59s)

[so freaking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m03s)

[ugly. Like that looks ugly.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m04s)

[Guess it's not bad if we format it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m14s)

[properly, right? If we do that, that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m16s)

[looks](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m20s)

[tolerable. Yeah. If null return not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m24s)

[found, otherwise okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m26s)

[response. Done. Now we can come up here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m28s)

[right? So this is then going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m32s)

[partner promotion code, right? because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m35s)

[we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m37s)

[to populate this sucker. This guy is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m41s)

[going to be unhappy that he doesn't have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m44s)

[everything set. Oh, and this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m46s)

[be interesting. We might need a separate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m49s)

[one because we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m51s)

[return like this will return fine, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m52s)

[we've now lost the the API key that we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m54s)

[generated. That's no bueno. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h13m59s)

[uh do move API key generation. I I would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m04s)

[like this generate function to not live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m11s)

[because right now it lives inside the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m13s)

[database model which is fineish except](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m15s)

[for I kind of want it used in two places](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m17s)

[which means it probably shouldn't live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m19s)

[in one of the places. And then we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m21s)

[with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m25s)

[partner routes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m27s)

[um get partner. And I'm realizing maybe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m34s)

[I should change these to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m37s)

[uh create partner. I think we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m42s)

[to change these to include](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m45s)

[uh promotion code. I I think is the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m49s)

[we're going to go. This This feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m52s)

[nicer. Let's see here. If I go bing Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m54s)

[what is it? Shift alt. Nope. Control](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h14m57s)

[alt. I never remember the multicursor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m01s)

[thing. So, control alt for those who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m07s)

[care. Paste. There we go. Okay. And then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m10s)

[control alt. We'll just abuse that nice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m13s)

[little thing again to put multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m15s)

[cursors down. And then paste.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m17s)

[Done. There we go. Except for right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m20s)

[there. That's not where we wanted one.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m23s)

[That that doesn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m24s)

[count. Okay, that that feels a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m26s)

[better. This guy now needs the same same](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m28s)

[treatment there. And then this one needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m31s)

[uh coupon code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m35s)

[ID. And this needs to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m37s)

[be partner ID.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m40s)

[And now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m45s)

[uh do include](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m47s)

[um API key because we need to we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m51s)

[show it somewhere, right? Because this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m54s)

[is the one place where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m56s)

[um API key actually propagates out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h15m59s)

[so we're going to need to need to add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m03s)

[that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m05s)

[in. Uh okay, so we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m06s)

[get do delete](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m10s)

[and we'll go and add some stuff to all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m15s)

[this. Let's see. We don't need user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m19s)

[context. We are going to need uh partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m21s)

[ID as the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m24s)

[gooid is that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m26s)

[necessary. And what do we return here?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m28s)

[No content or not found. That makes that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m32s)

[makes some good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m35s)

[sense. Aside from my typing skills don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m37s)

[make good sense. And then this is going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m40s)

[to I think functionally be exactly the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m42s)

[same. Well, sort of. There's some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m45s)

[permissions checks in here that don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m49s)

[make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m50s)

[sense. And we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m52s)

[do let's see here partner ID. And this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m55s)

[is going to be partner uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h16m58s)

[see fun code. And then we don't need any](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m04s)

[includes where ID singular](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m08s)

[default goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m12s)

[there. We go partner coupon codes. Save.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m15s)

[Save. Save. No content response. Done.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m19s)

[Next. Is the update call? Where's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m23s)

[update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m25s)

[call? Hey Isoreur, have a good one.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m27s)

[Thank you for dropping in. I appreciate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m30s)

[it. Uh, let's see. We do not have an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m32s)

[update built on this one. We only](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m35s)

[support](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m38s)

[delete. Okay, we'll just freehand it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m40s)

[No, we won't. We'll go copy it from I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m43s)

[don't know, probably Teams. Teams is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m46s)

[generally a simplistic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m48s)

[one. Create update. So, it's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m51s)

[something akin to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m55s)

[this. Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h17m57s)

[So this is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m00s)

[be partner ID. This is going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m04s)

[be update partner request. We need that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m08s)

[We don't need that. We don't need that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m12s)

[We do need that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m14s)

[Okay. Okay. And then functionally we do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m17s)

[something akin to this where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m20s)

[we do all the the interesting bits.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m24s)

[Okay. except for this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m27s)

[nowhere nearly as detailed. Uh something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m30s)

[else that's worth calling out is when I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m33s)

[register my database with EF Core, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m35s)

[explicitly register it as no tracking by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m38s)

[default. Um because the vast majority of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m40s)

[the time I'm just reading and when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m44s)

[do tracked entities in EF um your DB](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m45s)

[context has to watch for property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m49s)

[changes to know hey if you call save](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m52s)

[changes I go and update the thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m55s)

[right so if you if you don't need that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h18m58s)

[and you'll see some people do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m02s)

[opposite right they'll leave tracking on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m03s)

[by default and they'll do as no tracking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m05s)

[on the stuff where they don't care about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m07s)

[because there is a nice performance gain](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m08s)

[to be had if you tell EF F. Yeah, no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m09s)

[tracking. Don't worry about this. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m12s)

[don't need you to be watching it for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m14s)

[updates. It's like, oh, sweet. Less for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m15s)

[me to do. I'm cool with that. And then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m18s)

[you're off to the races. Um, in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m19s)

[case, because we are about to um update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m21s)

[it like this. In this case, it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m24s)

[somewhat important that we uh actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m27s)

[get this one correct. So, that's why we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m30s)

[turn on the track. And we don't care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m33s)

[about any of the permission stuff. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m35s)

[then this is going to be I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m38s)

[just cheat here. var and then see look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m40s)

[at that. Uh let's see. Coupon code goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m43s)

[like that as tracking singular default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m48s)

[async. Great. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m51s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m53s)

[here. And then we're going to go here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m55s)

[And then we're going to say I don't care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m58s)

[about any of this because I think that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h19m59s)

[all we put on the request was name,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m01s)

[right? Yep. That's the only thing we let](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m02s)

[them edit is the name. Don't care about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m04s)

[any of this. Don't care about any of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m07s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m08s)

[Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m09s)

[Boom. Okay. And then we need to return](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m12s)

[the updated one when we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m14s)

[done. Sorry, I'm missing something. Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m24s)

[it's because we don't we haven't updated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m27s)

[the return type. That's what's going on.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m30s)

[So, don't do we actually return problem?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m36s)

[Oh, we return problem in some of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m39s)

[cases. I don't think we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m41s)

[it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m43s)

[here. We can probably dial this sucker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m44s)

[down a little bit because I don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m47s)

[we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m49s)

[this. We are going to need to return](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m51s)

[back a partner promotion code in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m54s)

[case of an update.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h20m57s)

[So we will do that but we won't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m00s)

[need any of the interesting bits. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m05s)

[we'll just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m08s)

[that. And there may be an argument that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m09s)

[and by maybe an argument I'm realizing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m12s)

[that the fact that I want to do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m14s)

[multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m16s)

[times means I should I should probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m19s)

[consider pulling this out. the the there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m22s)

[is a very important difference between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m25s)

[so this select here right you'll note X](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m28s)

[in this case is in um EF core entity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m32s)

[instance and I am projecting it into my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m36s)

[Poco my C# object that's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m40s)

[returned out from the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m42s)

[right this select and this little bit of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m44s)

[logic here is not the same as this down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m47s)

[here right even even though they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m51s)

[about to look real bloody](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m53s)

[similar, right? And it's it's real happy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m56s)

[to So this new,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h21m59s)

[right? And this new are not the same.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m02s)

[And the reason they are not the same is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m07s)

[because this select is inside of a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m09s)

[system link expression, right? So this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m13s)

[is going to get translated into SQL.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m16s)

[This is going to be C# code that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m19s)

[executed.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m21s)

[So, even though it looks like I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m23s)

[duplicating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m25s)

[code, I guess I'm I Well, this one's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m27s)

[going to be different because it's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m30s)

[to include the API key. So, that one's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m31s)

[going to that one's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m32s)

[something slightly different, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m34s)

[We'll do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m36s)

[instead just to get it compiling for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m37s)

[now. This is also the same expression.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m40s)

[So, like I could do I could do two](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m43s)

[overloads. One for the expression and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m46s)

[one for this, but this one's going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m49s)

[different. Don't know how I feel about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m53s)

[that because this one's actually going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m56s)

[to be a diff. We're probably going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m58s)

[create a a details one that had includes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h22m59s)

[the API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m02s)

[key. So, so this is actually not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m04s)

[duplicating any of the code above](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m08s)

[despite how similar it looks.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m10s)

[That's exciting. I mean, I guess](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m13s)

[technically it is duplicating this one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m14s)

[for now, but this one's going to change.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m16s)

[So, but there is no there's no actual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m18s)

[duplication. Okay, there's all of that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m20s)

[That gets me in there. That gets things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m24s)

[built up. Let's make sure we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m26s)

[compiling and then let's go spin some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m27s)

[tests. Right. I guess the other thing we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m31s)

[can do is I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m34s)

[can me find](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m35s)

[my Right. I can kill that. And then um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m37s)

[if we want to launch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m41s)

[the we could go and make sure that this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m42s)

[thing actually spun correctly. We can go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m44s)

[look at the swagger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m46s)

[doc. All right. So this guy fires up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m50s)

[does the things. Oh, I I never went back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m53s)

[to the um ASP.NET host. So I called out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m55s)

[inside of here that I was doing this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h23m59s)

[persistent lifetime. This is actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m02s)

[very convenient. So if you leave this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m05s)

[off, what you will get is a uh a docker](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m06s)

[container with your SQL server and when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m11s)

[you shut down your Aspire host, it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m14s)

[shut down the container. And so unless](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m15s)

[you so when you are spinning up SQL](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m18s)

[server inside of a Docker container, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m20s)

[have some choices to make. Um, one you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m22s)

[can buy, you can do like a volume mount](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m25s)

[to give it some persistent storage so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m27s)

[that when your database server shuts](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m29s)

[down, your database is not lost because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m31s)

[if you do nothing, it's just ephemeral](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m33s)

[and every time that container dies, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m35s)

[lose everything and you start over,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m37s)

[right? Maybe that's what you want,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m40s)

[right? Like maybe you're doing some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m41s)

[integration tests and wiping the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m42s)

[database is a good thing, right? That](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m44s)

[could be a thing. Um, so you can do a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m45s)

[volume mount to be able to to have some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m49s)

[persistence there and go back and forth.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m51s)

[Um, the other thing you can do is you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m52s)

[can set this lifetime and this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m54s)

[effectively sets the container lifetime](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m56s)

[to say, you know what, and I think the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m58s)

[docs are actually pretty good.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h24m59s)

[Um, we'll jump in here, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m02s)

[Uh, so if the container doesn't exist,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m05s)

[it will get created.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m08s)

[Um, the it will attempt to reuse it if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m11s)

[uh if it can effectively. And so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m15s)

[kind of the middle ground that I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m19s)

[decided I liked best is this will spin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m21s)

[up a brand new SQL server, fresh, clean](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m24s)

[state. I can muck with it and as long as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m27s)

[I'm running locally and deb debugging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m30s)

[because remember I'm using this aspire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m32s)

[host for my local environment. If I ever](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m33s)

[want to start over, I just kill the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m36s)

[Docker container and poof, I have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m38s)

[fresh database all over again. It is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m40s)

[mildly obnoxious if I have like a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m43s)

[Windows update and I have to reboot in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m45s)

[the middle or a Docker update and I have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m46s)

[to restart Docker. Like that's annoying](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m48s)

[because it's like ah shoot maybe I'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m50s)

[delay that for a little bit because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m52s)

[know I don't want to blow my database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m54s)

[away yet. So it's like well maybe I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m55s)

[should add a volume out maybe not. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m57s)

[don't know. So uh those are the pros and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h25m59s)

[cons. Pick which one you like best. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m03s)

[it's it's all about what's more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m06s)

[important to you. Keeping the data](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m07s)

[around or being able to go back to a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m09s)

[clean state. And in my case, I like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m11s)

[going back to a clean state a lot. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m12s)

[I've got scripts that will repopulate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m14s)

[testing data for me if I want it. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m17s)

[it's like I can I can get my database](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m18s)

[receded very easily. That's not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m21s)

[problem. And you could write little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m24s)

[database seeders and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m25s)

[too. So it's like if you've got easy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m27s)

[ways of repopulating the data, going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m29s)

[back to a clean state isn't always that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m31s)

[bad, right? And I like that middle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m32s)

[ground of we'll leave the container](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m34s)

[running. That way as I'm you know debug](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m35s)

[launch debug launch debug launch it it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m37s)

[stays there and across debug sessions uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m40s)

[my data persists it just doesn't persist](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m43s)

[if I kill the container. So I I have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m45s)

[very easy way of resetting myself back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m47s)

[if I want to. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m49s)

[Uh I have no idea there it is where it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m53s)

[launched to. So if I look at my admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m57s)

[API and hit the swagger page, what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h26m58s)

[should see, oh right, we did all of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m00s)

[work and we didn't bind anything. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m03s)

[nothing shows up in the swagger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m05s)

[endpoint. See, this is why we should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m06s)

[test. Okay, so not so that did nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m08s)

[and it did nothing because over here in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m11s)

[my program CS I have done nothing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m13s)

[bind any of it. So yeah, so all of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m15s)

[is uh you garbage. Um I don't know why I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m18s)

[have that sitting around. Let's get rid](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m22s)

[of that. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m24s)

[Uh so if we look at the API service one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m26s)

[this guy here like if we look at team](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m30s)

[extensions right this map team endpoints](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m32s)

[right is only invoked by one place. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m34s)

[effectively I just have a bunch of calls](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m38s)

[here that shell out to each of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m40s)

[individual ones as needed. So if we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m42s)

[back up here what that means is about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m44s)

[here we're going to do this and we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m48s)

[going to do map partner endpoints. That](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m50s)

[will get us to there. We are then going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m54s)

[to kill](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m56s)

[off this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h27m58s)

[thing because I don't want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m00s)

[to I'm going to comment it because I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m04s)

[want to go and look up this verify has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m07s)

[accepted scope stuff because I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m09s)

[remember exactly how I need to set this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m10s)

[up. We're going to we're going to just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m12s)

[kill that. But now when I launch what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m14s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m16s)

[uh what is the front end written in?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m17s)

[Great question. So the uh the front end](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m19s)

[for the website itself is React. So if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m22s)

[we jump over here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m25s)

[uh clearly we have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m32s)

[problems. Uh let's see. I should be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m35s)

[to hit my GitHub account](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m37s)

[here. Should just work. Yay. So yeah. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m40s)

[this is the this is the React front end.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m44s)

[I think I have it set up for my local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m46s)

[environment.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m48s)

[It looks like I do. Yeah. So, that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m49s)

[that's where this one is sitting in. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m52s)

[and it's the the front end for this. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m55s)

[just with my partner and the way we were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h28m58s)

[splitting up the work, the front end is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m00s)

[the only part of kind of the hosted](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m02s)

[solution that lives outside of my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m04s)

[backend repository. So, if you you'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m06s)

[note in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m09s)

[uh Aspire app host, I've got kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m12s)

[this weird little directory thing that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m15s)

[just says, "Hey, let's go and look and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m18s)

[see if the front end is checked out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m19s)

[right alongside of us." And if it is,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m21s)

[great. We're going to add another uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m22s)

[resource into our dashboard with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m24s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m26s)

[Done. So, simple little way of bringing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m30s)

[it in without doing a lot of work. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m34s)

[then the key thing here is just kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m37s)

[um uh this little dirty check with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m40s)

[the API service and having this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m43s)

[reference flow through. That way it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m46s)

[automatically u references back to my uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m48s)

[API.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m54s)

[Uh let's see. Uh Heisen uh hi Kevin.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h29m56s)

[trying to get a reference to a canvas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m00s)

[that's inside an items panel uh of an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m01s)

[items control but it's not directly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m04s)

[accessible by name in the code beahheim.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m07s)

[Right now I'm handling this by using the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m09s)

[loaded event of the canvas entering](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m11s)

[first in the visual tree items full](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m12s)

[border canvas and storing as a reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m15s)

[to it in a private field. Um I assigned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m17s)

[to a new dummy canvas beforehand but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m21s)

[this feels ugly. Is there a better way?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m24s)

[Um, so probably let me let me sorry I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m29s)

[just want to read this one more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m33s)

[time. So you have an items panel inside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m35s)

[of an items control and you're basically](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m38s)

[looking to do I I'm guessing this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m40s)

[some sort of like drag dropy situation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m42s)

[where the canvas is the desirable panel](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m45s)

[because of its absolute positioning. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m48s)

[I am also Heisen I'm making an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m51s)

[assumption this is WPF. If that's wrong,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m52s)

[please correct me. But this this I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m55s)

[fairly confident this WPF. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h30m57s)

[So items control border canvas and you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m00s)

[want to be able to get access to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m03s)

[canvas by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m05s)

[name.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m07s)

[Uh so let's see here. The items panel is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m10s)

[effectively a data template. So it's not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m16s)

[populated right away.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m18s)

[Is there a cleaner way to get at it than](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m24s)

[just parsing the visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m27s)

[tree? Because I I know we've done](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m30s)

[this. Let me look real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m34s)

[quick. Sorry, I was checking to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m39s)

[see. Vic.exe, if you're there, feel free](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m45s)

[to chime in. you've done this more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m49s)

[recently than I have.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m50s)

[Um trying to think if there is a if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m53s)

[there is a cleaner solution because in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m55s)

[your items control you set the items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h31m58s)

[panel, you set the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m02s)

[canvas. You can't really get to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m03s)

[canvas via](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m06s)

[name, which makes some sense because you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m09s)

[said see Vic, you're there. So when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m13s)

[did this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m17s)

[before, I think you went v I I think you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m18s)

[did something very similar where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m21s)

[watch for the loaded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m23s)

[event and then grab the canvas.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m26s)

[Though honestly, if you're grabbing the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m31s)

[loaded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m34s)

[event, I don't think you have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m36s)

[traverse the visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m38s)

[tree. I'm not sure I needed a reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m40s)

[to it. Ah, okay. So, you may have gotten](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m42s)

[around it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m45s)

[Um, yeah. So, there's there's a couple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m48s)

[options here that that you may be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m51s)

[to do. So, if you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m53s)

[uh let me see, do I have Okay, detour](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m56s)

[time. Uh, let me find an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h32m59s)

[appropriately scoped terminal window.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m03s)

[Uh, we're just going to jump. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m07s)

[see. Make it WPF test, right? DD WPF](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m11s)

[testn net](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m17s)

[new.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m20s)

[Boom. And we got a solution.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m28s)

[Um, so there there's a couple things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m35s)

[that may be worth consideration.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m38s)

[Sorry, it's going to spend a hot second](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m42s)

[here while it figures itself out. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m44s)

[you've got something that looks akin to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m46s)

[this. Right. So, items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m48s)

[control items control uh items panel and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m51s)

[then you've got some sort of uh items](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h33m56s)

[panel template, right? And then we've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m00s)

[got the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m01s)

[canvas. Boom. So, you've got you've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m03s)

[something akin to this. and you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m05s)

[be able to grab a hold of this canvas to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m07s)

[be able to do uh useful stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m09s)

[So, a few things like if you're if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m14s)

[you're already watching the loaded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m17s)

[event, right? And you do something like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m19s)

[this in your code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m21s)

[behind. So, canvas C](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m25s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m30s)

[canvas sender, right? like you can grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m33s)

[it. You can grab it as simply as this to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m36s)

[be able to cache it. And if you're if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m38s)

[you are just looking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m41s)

[to hold on to it because you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m43s)

[register on up um mouse events and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m46s)

[similar on there. The other thing you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m49s)

[So, this will get you a a reference that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m52s)

[you could do and it it'll save you at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m54s)

[least the parsing of the visual tree,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m55s)

[which I I kind of like a little bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m57s)

[better. And this might be why you didn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h34m59s)

[need a direct reference to it, Bick,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m02s)

[because the the other thing you can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m04s)

[is if you're wanting to register up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m06s)

[mouse events, I'm trying to remember](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m09s)

[is like is this not Let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m13s)

[uh background transparent. Like I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m17s)

[wondering if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m20s)

[actually need to grab it or if you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m22s)

[just register the event straight up on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m25s)

[it. So we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m27s)

[to we're going to just do that for a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m30s)

[second because I think you can just grab](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m33s)

[it. I I think you can avoid needing a a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m35s)

[hard reference to it and just register](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m38s)

[the event handlers to your codebind. The](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m41s)

[other thing that may be worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m43s)

[consideration is a behavior because a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m45s)

[behavior is a nice way of attaching code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m47s)

[mouse down event comes right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h35m53s)

[through. Yeah. So you may be able So I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m01s)

[guess I would be curious to see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m06s)

[Um yeah, I I think I I think you might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m12s)

[be able to get away without needing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m15s)

[to store the if all you're doing is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m17s)

[adding event handlers to your canvas. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m19s)

[think you can just register event](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m21s)

[handlers directly on this because then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m23s)

[the um these events are are wired up for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m26s)

[you as part of this initialize](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m30s)

[component. I don't know if it'll let me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m31s)

[in. Uh yeah, so it's going to be hidden](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m33s)

[away in the load component, but it the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m35s)

[initialize component handles registering](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m37s)

[those things for you because it knows](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m39s)

[when it's injected um the appropriate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m41s)

[instance for that canvas. And so these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m44s)

[things then get built up and you're off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m47s)

[to the races, right? So down here in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m48s)

[this connect after it's done all of this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m52s)

[fancy stuff, this is always a fun one.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m54s)

[Line number 29.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m56s)

[Um, which pro tip, this is an awesome](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h36m58s)

[trick if people haven't seen this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m02s)

[before. It's very rarely used in your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m03s)

[own code and mostly used in generators,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m05s)

[but if you want to lie to the debugger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m07s)

[about where it should be, this is how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m09s)

[you can do it. Pound line file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m12s)

[reference and the debugger will just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m16s)

[happily move the execution pointer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m18s)

[there. It's really fun. Again, this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m20s)

[done just so that the debugger goes,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m23s)

["Oh, okay. This loaded thing is actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m25s)

[line 29 in main](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m29s)

[window.zaml because this is functionally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m31s)

[where the developer wrote it." But it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m33s)

[like, well, it's not actually there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m34s)

[It's it's it's actually over here. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m36s)

[you know, you can do that kind of stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m38s)

[So, yeah. Um, give that a shot, Heisen,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m40s)

[and see. I think in most cases, if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m43s)

[just register the event handlers, you'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m46s)

[then be good. If you do need to cache it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m48s)

[for something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m52s)

[else, I would I would just grab it like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m53s)

[this. I think this is probably the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m56s)

[easiest way to do it because then you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h37m58s)

[don't have to think as hard. Um but if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m00s)

[if the if the behavior that you need can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m02s)

[be kind of wrapped up and contained, um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m05s)

[a behavior is not a bad idea either,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m08s)

[right? So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m10s)

[um, so you end up referencing the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m14s)

[interactivity bits,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m17s)

[uh, ZAML behaviors](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m22s)

[wiki. Yeah. So, this this is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m25s)

[community toolkits docs, but they they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m28s)

[shell out to the other ones, and their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m30s)

[docs are fairly good because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m31s)

[they they're they're using the same uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m33s)

[base class. They've just come with a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m37s)

[of built-in ones.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m38s)

[Um, but a behavior is often a nice way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m41s)

[of wrapping up the code behind stuff](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m45s)

[because it gives you an attach detach](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m47s)

[method and one of the properties is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m49s)

[associated element which in your case if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m51s)

[you attach the behavior to the canvas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m54s)

[you then have this class with an attach](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m56s)

[detach where you can register up to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h38m59s)

[events and everything to your heart's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m01s)

[content. The the only thing with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m03s)

[behaviors though that you have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m04s)

[remember is they're they're designed to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m05s)

[be kind of encapsulated code behind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m07s)

[units um that are technically reusable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m09s)

[that you can drop into other places. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m12s)

[it may be overkill if you're never going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m14s)

[to reuse it, but it is a nice way of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m16s)

[getting yourself code behind onto a ZAML](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m18s)

[element that might not otherwise have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m21s)

[code behind. So for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m22s)

[example, this guy here, like a resource](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m24s)

[dictionary by default doesn't have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m27s)

[code behind file. And so you can either](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m28s)

[make a resource dictionary have a code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m31s)

[behind file or you can just attach a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m33s)

[behavior to the element inside the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m35s)

[resource dictionary and kind of get that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m37s)

[same type of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m39s)

[behavior. So it it depends a little bit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m40s)

[on what you're doing, but something of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m43s)

[that nature perhaps. But yeah, give that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m44s)

[a shot. See how that works. Good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m47s)

[question](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m49s)

[though. Love questions. So, if anybody](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m51s)

[if anybody has stuff like I always come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m54s)

[into these streams with an idea of what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m57s)

[I'm going to work on, but I am I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h39m58s)

[always happy to uh to rabbit trail if if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m02s)

[people have interesting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m04s)

[questions. Okay, now I just have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m07s)

[stack pop my brain back to where I was.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m10s)

[We were mapping](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m13s)

[endpoints so that they showed up in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m15s)

[Swagger. Yeah, that's what we were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m20s)

[doing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m22s)

[We're getting rid of all this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m23s)

[garbage, putting all that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m25s)

[there. And we are mapping partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m28s)

[endpoints, which will then have all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m31s)

[these, which will do all of the needful.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m33s)

[And then we're going to we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m35s)

[see if it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m36s)

[works. I think that's what we were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m39s)

[doing. I got very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m41s)

[distracted. My brain had to switch into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m43s)

[ZAML mode. Okay. And then I just want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m45s)

[see I want to see my swagger page. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m49s)

[Oh, that's right. Body in was inferred,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m52s)

[but the method does not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m54s)

[allow inferred body parameters. I do not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h40m56s)

[about. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m03s)

[wrong. If the parameter's name is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m16s)

[hints on which method this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m21s)

[was? Do do you want to explain why you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m23s)

[have this random apostrophe just hanging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m26s)

[here. Quest delegate create](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h41m47s)

[so we could probably guess our way into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m03s)

[this one. Worst case scenario, we binary](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m06s)

[search it with copying things out. But I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m09s)

[the list is the one catching me because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m43s)

[attention. So, let's get rid of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m56s)

[create for the moment and see if that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h42m58s)

[fixes it. And then we're going to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m01s)

[rid of the list as well. But I have a I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m03s)

[have a suspicion that it's not that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m08s)

[one. And we can go through and decorate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m10s)

[But it got further partner ID](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m29s)

[on. Does this have partner ID and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h43m37s)

[spin some test stuff. And we might we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m11s)

[them and verify the parameters and all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m32s)

[can see that put will only take a name.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m36s)

[If we go with the post, it'll see that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m38s)

[it wants a name and a Stripe coupon code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m40s)

[is we have not actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h46m49s)

[actually when we do this create the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m09s)

[whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m12s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m24s)

[aade stripe service. Uh create promotion](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m25s)

[Request. Oh, we don't. Oh, wait, wait,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m32s)

[wait. We we we don't we don't create the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m34s)

[creating the partner. The partner API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m37s)

[will create the promotion code, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m40s)

[I'm an idiot. Okay, this is fine. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m42s)

[is the admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m46s)

[API. Okay. And now we're going to go try](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m48s)

[to shoot myself in the foot real quick.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m52s)

[So on my testing, what do I have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m54s)

[referenced in now here? Now, I do have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m57s)

[Fluent Assertions in here, and I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h47m59s)

[mildly unhappy because for anybody who](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m03s)

[saw, Fluent Assertions changed their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m06s)

[licensing model,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m08s)

[and it's kind of a touchy subject](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m10s)

[because on one hand, I like the idea of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m13s)

[people like open source developers do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m16s)

[not make money. they they need a paid](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m19s)

[for model, but I always hate when I see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m22s)

[something that was free change itself to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m25s)

[not be free.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m28s)

[And in a lot of cases where people go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m31s)

[with like dual licenses where it's like,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m33s)

[okay, you only pay if you're a big](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m35s)

[business and you don't pay if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m36s)

[aren't, like that's fine, but I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m38s)

[want to like grow this and then all of a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m41s)

[sudden start eating extra cost when it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m44s)

[like I don't know that it's actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m46s)

[giving me that much value. was like if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m47s)

[it was giving me more value maybe. But](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m51s)

[eh, okay. The other thing that it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m56s)

[worth noting about is I do have all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h48m59s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m02s)

[stuff piled on in here. And I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m04s)

[really like part of me wants to go full](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m07s)

[T-Unit. I really like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m10s)

[T-Unit, but I would have to fight with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m14s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m18s)

[So, we're not going to do that. We're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m19s)

[going to stick with XUnit because I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m21s)

[not going to shoot myself in the foot. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m23s)

[I love TUnit. And for people who are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m26s)

[unfamiliar with TUnit, uh check out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m28s)

[prior](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m31s)

[streams, too. Uh let's see. So, I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m33s)

[to be Nope. I'm in the wrong repo. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m36s)

[want to be underneath](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m40s)

[test where we're going to land. And we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m42s)

[are going to call this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m44s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m47s)

[velopac admin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m49s)

[API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m51s)

[tests. Send](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m53s)

[it. We are going net 9 all the things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h49m55s)

[Not that it's going to matter that much.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m00s)

[Okay. So, we need to do a handful of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m01s)

[things. First of all, nuke all that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m04s)

[crap.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m06s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m08s)

[next we probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m10s)

[want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m14s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m15s)

[here. We do not need the global using](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m17s)

[that's handled. I've got like my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m21s)

[directory build props is quite](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m23s)

[extensive. So I do a lot of stuff to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m26s)

[just make it all work nicely for me. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m29s)

[I don't have to think real hard. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m31s)

[okay. So there that gets me to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m33s)

[there. Let's see. We need a project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m35s)

[reference to the project we want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m37s)

[test. That makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m39s)

[sense. Add that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m41s)

[Done. And then I guess we'll do the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m44s)

[fluent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m47s)

[analyzers. Uh I'm kind of trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m49s)

[decide why that isn't up here and not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m52s)

[anywhere](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m56s)

[else because the package reference lives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h50m59s)

[here. So I think I can put this here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m01s)

[then just kill this off. I don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m03s)

[this needs to exist.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m05s)

[Okay, there. Make that a little simpler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m08s)

[for all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m10s)

[involved. I'm I'm going to just while](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m13s)

[I'm doing this, go kill all of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m17s)

[things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m20s)

[off because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m22s)

[moved all of these things off. You could](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m25s)

[probably just change it in one place](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m29s)

[there, too.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m31s)

[But there all of that out. Um, the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m36s)

[thing that I've done is I've actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m40s)

[pinned Fluent Assertions back to an a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m42s)

[slightly older version where it uh is no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m44s)

[longer dealing with their updated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m48s)

[licensing stuff. So, just because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m49s)

[decided to do that to give me time to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m53s)

[think about what I actually want to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m56s)

[long term. JC, good morning. Welcome,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m57s)

[welcome, welcome. We are having fun in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h51m59s)

[web API land and packac. It's very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m02s)

[exciting. We are building an admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m06s)

[so that I can generate promotion codes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m08s)

[for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m11s)

[coupons. I know it's very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m12s)

[exciting. It's exciting for me. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m15s)

[because I enjoy building this stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m18s)

[Okay, so that gets me all the way to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m20s)

[there. That gets me to there. I got my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m21s)

[band symbols going. That's this is for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m23s)

[people who haven't seen this. This is if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m27s)

[you want to annoy your colleagues. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m30s)

[is this is how you do it. Um let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m32s)

[I think it's actually all the way top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m35s)

[level. We build](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m38s)

[props. No, where where is the package in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m40s)

[here? There's the band API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m44s)

[analyzer. Yeah. So, this Microsoft code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m49s)

[analysis band API analyzers. This is one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m52s)

[of the coolest ones. I love this thing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h52m56s)

[people. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m02s)

[uh I think the docs for it are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m07s)

[here. Uh let's see. Let's just hunt](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m13s)

[band. I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m15s)

[it's I think it's in here. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m17s)

[see. Do not use band APIs, blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m20s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m23s)

[blah, meant disposable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m25s)

[correctly. Yeah, they're they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m28s)

[referencing it in here. Short version,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m30s)

[you bring in this band API analyzer for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m32s)

[anybody who wants to play along at home.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m35s)

[And then you can create this band](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m38s)

[symbols.txt file at the root of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m40s)

[project. And anything that it finds in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m42s)

[here, it just straight up like it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m47s)

[generate uh a build warning that you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m50s)

[then elevate to an air if you'd like. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m53s)

[you can just straight ban APIs of please](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h53m55s)

[do not use this ever. So, for example, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m00s)

[have banned the usage of calling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m03s)

[datetime offset now and UTC now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m05s)

[specifically and I leave a nice little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m08s)

[message of, hey, if you're trying to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m11s)

[this, here's the alternative, right? Use](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m13s)

[the new time provider API that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m15s)

[included in net 9, right? Like, go do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m18s)

[that. So, it's a way of kicking people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m20s)

[and it's like when you want to flag a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m25s)

[method as obsolete, but the method isn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m28s)

[yours. This is how you can do it. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m30s)

[fun tricks. Fun tricks. And it keeps](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m34s)

[future Kevin from doing something that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m37s)

[current Kevin doesn't like. That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m38s)

[that's that's also](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m41s)

[important. Okay. So, I want to do a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m43s)

[couple things and I want to do one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m46s)

[these tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m49s)

[immediately. We're going to come up here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m51s)

[and we're going to paste](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m52s)

[this because we're going to get this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m55s)

[going. So the the idea here is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h54m57s)

[that this should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m01s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m04s)

[um I I want to effectively snapshot uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m06s)

[test into uh to make sure that my API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m11s)

[doesn't change without me knowing about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m15s)

[it. Does that need to go into material](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m16s)

[design and ZAML?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m18s)

[Uh that's a good question JC. Maybe the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m20s)

[only thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m24s)

[that's I might think on that because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m26s)

[like I said it is a great analyzer for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m28s)

[annoying people and I try to keep the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m30s)

[bar for entry on material design and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m32s)

[ZAML as low as is I think reasonable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m34s)

[like I don't elevate warnings as errors](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m37s)

[locally but I do elevate them on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m41s)

[pipeline. So it's like people who want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m43s)

[to just kind of clone and play around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m45s)

[with the repository I don't want them to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m46s)

[have to fight with it to get it going.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m48s)

[Um, and then but I do bump warnings as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m50s)

[there's up on the pipeline. So if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m54s)

[get to the point of submitting a PR, at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m55s)

[that point it's like, well, now we kind](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m57s)

[of got to actually like fix stuff. Like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h55m58s)

[I want people to download and clone and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m00s)

[and play without feeling like they're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m02s)

[fighting with the tooling because it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m03s)

[like if somebody just clones and wants](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m05s)

[to play around locally, I don't care](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m06s)

[what they do. I only care when it merges](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m08s)

[back like and I care a little bit. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m10s)

[but yeah, it may think on that. it it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m14s)

[may be worth doing at some point um just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m18s)

[to kind of strongly hit to people. The](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m21s)

[one thing I really want is I want an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m24s)

[equivalent for it for ZAML. Like I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m26s)

[ZAML analyzers. Like we've got C#](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m29s)

[analyzers now. I want it for my ZAML.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m31s)

[Like I also want source generators for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m33s)

[my ZAML. That would be nice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m35s)

[too. Uh who wins the battle between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m37s)

[future and past](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m40s)

[Kevin? Well, current Kevin always wins.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m41s)

[Past Kevin is generally considered to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m45s)

[an idiot and future Kevin just makes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m47s)

[mistakes. So current Kevin's always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m50s)

[best, but I think I take future Kevin](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m52s)

[over past Kevin. Past Kevin didn't know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m54s)

[anything. I think that's that that's I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m57s)

[think the general way of how that works.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h56m59s)

[Okay, so web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m01s)

[factory.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m03s)

[Uh boy, I am going to want to move some](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m07s)

[of this into a shared place where I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m10s)

[play with it. Um, but this class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m12s)

[here, so we're going to copy this thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m18s)

[over and then we're going to figure out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m21s)

[what we need to keep and what we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m23s)

[change. So step one, what we need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m26s)

[change is the name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m28s)

[space. That needs to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m29s)

[immediately. Okay. And now this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m33s)

[here, this is the other, this is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m37s)

[other thing. And I was wondering if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m40s)

[was going to get bit by this, but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m42s)

[didn't know how the other one worked.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m43s)

[So, you'll note it wants to reference a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m45s)

[program, but I need the program class to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m48s)

[be public. How did I make it public? Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m50s)

[that's what I did. Like, how did I make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m54s)

[it public? So, when you use a um top](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h57m57s)

[level statement, so like all of this,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m01s)

[what is that? Was that garbage? Um this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m03s)

[all gets put into a generated program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m07s)

[class with a main method and all that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m09s)

[It's great. It's wonderful. The problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m11s)

[is the uh the program class gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m12s)

[generated um as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m16s)

[class program. Technically it gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m20s)

[generated partial class program but the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m23s)

[default access modifier for classes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m27s)

[without anything specified is internal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m30s)

[which means you can't touch it from your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m32s)

[unit test project. So the dirty little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m34s)

[trick is you come down here and you go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m37s)

[you know what I'm going to declare](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m38s)

[another part of that partial and I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m40s)

[going to put an access modifier on it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m42s)

[that's public. So boom done.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m43s)

[It's one of those areas of C where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m49s)

[have to know the internals of how it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m51s)

[works in order to like use it well. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m53s)

[it's very unfortunate. I think in an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m57s)

[ideal situation, people wouldn't have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h58m59s)

[know the internals to leverage it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m01s)

[effectively, but in this case, that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m03s)

[just unfortunately a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m06s)

[uh a side](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m10s)

[effect. Uh comment required.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m12s)

[Probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m15s)

[probably this uh changes the default](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m17s)

[access](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m23s)

[modifier of the program class to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m25s)

[public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m27s)

[for testing with web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m29s)

[factory. Probably a good call out. Okay,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m38s)

[we're going to get rid of that for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m40s)

[until I know that I need it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m41s)

[Okay, we have serialization which we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m44s)

[need. We have SQLite which we need. I So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m47s)

[I'm looking at this from the perspective](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m51s)

[of I think some of this is about to move](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m52s)

[into a base class that I can reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m56s)

[in both my test projects because I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=01h59m58s)

[I'm going to end up wanting a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m01s)

[this. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m06s)

[think now I'm obviously going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m09s)

[this this isn't going to be right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m12s)

[because this is setting up um claims on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m14s)

[uh a user that's expected to look like a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m18s)

[B2C user whereas in this case I want it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m21s)

[to look like an admin user. So that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m23s)

[going to be very different. Um we don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m25s)

[need any of these. We don't need any of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m29s)

[these.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m33s)

[I do like the idea of having the Stripe](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m35s)

[service simulator. So, where does that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m39s)

[live? Because we do have a shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m42s)

[testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m45s)

[repository where we can move some of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m46s)

[this down.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m48s)

[But I'm wondering if maybe what I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m54s)

[is a service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m56s)

[test to hold the to hold the shared bits](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h00m58s)

[because the the stripe service lives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m02s)

[inside a service core and so I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m05s)

[thinking an equivalent there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m07s)

[probably apt um the xunit logging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m10s)

[provider. Where is that? Why is that not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m13s)

[in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m15s)

[shared Why are you not in my shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m16s)

[stuff? You should absolutely be in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m19s)

[shared stuff. Yeah, I don't know why](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m21s)

[this one's not. So, that's just in a bad](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m24s)

[place. Pull you out. Put you in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m26s)

[Because you should probably be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m30s)

[underneath my XUnit](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m32s)

[folder. That would make a lot more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m34s)

[sense. Change namespace. Make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m36s)

[public. You should be accessible. You](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m40s)

[can stay internal, I believe. Same with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m43s)

[you. I don't think either of you need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m46s)

[be exposed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m48s)

[until such a time as I see a reason](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m49s)

[to. Um, let's build this project and see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m54s)

[if anything broke. Hopefully the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h01m58s)

[namespace refactor just worked. Of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m01s)

[course not. That would Oh, this is Hold](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m04s)

[on. Uh, let's see. Admin one I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m09s)

[care about. This one I care about.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m12s)

[extent login provider couldn't be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m17s)

[found. Include that. Okay, so that'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m19s)

[fix that'll fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m23s)

[that. Um, but I do think I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m26s)

[need a base web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m28s)

[because a good chunk of this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m30s)

[is going to straight get reused. So, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m32s)

[think we're going to leverage that. You](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m35s)

[should now be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m37s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m48s)

[keep. I just do this. Register the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h02m49s)

[here? What else is tightly coupled?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m32s)

[an uncoupled thing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m36s)

[This probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m53s)

[moves because we're going to need HMAC](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m57s)

[in more than one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h03m59s)

[into the service core.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m05s)

[Let's look at that first of all. So I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m09s)

[think is Omac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m12s)

[um this was the authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m16s)

[helper authentication](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m19s)

[options. I see no reason why this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m22s)

[shouldn't move into service core because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m25s)

[we're going to need it in multiple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m29s)

[places. So that seems to be a good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m30s)

[argument to move it. Let's give oursel](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m32s)

[cut, paste, and I have fairly good test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m39s)

[coverage over this whole area. So, if it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m43s)

[seems like I'm making changes kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m47s)

[willy-nilly, it's because I'm real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m48s)

[confident that if my tests pass that I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h04m50s)

[I don't understand why this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m13s)

[exists. Unless I'm missing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m21s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m28s)

[yeah, this can just be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m30s)

[that I think that's slightly more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m38s)

[obvious too of what's going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m41s)

[on.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m43s)

[Um, where's that options coming](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m46s)

[from? Oh, it was passed down. It was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m50s)

[being passed in from the base. Yeah, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m53s)

[think I I like just being explicit.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h05m56s)

[That wasn't overriding anything from the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m01s)

[base, was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m02s)

[it? No, these are both legitimately just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m04s)

[at this level. I don't think there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m08s)

[anything in the base that references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m11s)

[it. Nope.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m14s)

[Okay. So, we're going to go with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m17s)

[deletion. And we moved him down](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m20s)

[and we changed his reference. And that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m24s)

[should now work.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m28s)

[We'll see about moving more in a minute,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m30s)

[but for now that gets that should get us](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m32s)

[compiling, okay? Because we'll pro we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m37s)

[we'll almost assuredly need more here in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m39s)

[a bit. But what I'm looking for is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m41s)

[thing is looking real close to what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m43s)

[would consider a good base class for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m45s)

[what I'm going to want.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m48s)

[So, I think we're going to just yank](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m50s)

[this sucker out, genericize him,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m52s)

[and be in a pretty good place for most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h06m57s)

[of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m01s)

[this. Okay, so let's go and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m03s)

[take this web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m09s)

[believe it's under edit and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m24s)

[advanced and where is it? It's remove](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m28s)

[and sort](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h07m31s)

[Let's add a class library.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m30s)

[Next, because we're we're going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m32s)

[it in both cases anyway.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m34s)

[Uh oh, yeah. No, that's a good point.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m37s)

[The cleanup profiles. So, the Where are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m40s)

[those things? Um you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m43s)

[um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m51s)

[uh configure code cleanup and then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m55s)

[there's the two run code cleanup. So in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m57s)

[the configure code cleanup, you can add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h09m59s)

[in whatever you want here. And I've seen](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m02s)

[people do this quite a bit where they've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m05s)

[got multiple profiles for like remove](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m06s)

[unnecessary and sort using. You can do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m08s)

[auto formats. This is often times](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m10s)

[a very nice way. Usually people's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m14s)

[biggest complaint is there's not enough](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m17s)

[fixers in here for everything they want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m19s)

[to do. But it does get you it does get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m21s)

[you a fairly reasonable thing. I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m23s)

[always I don't know. I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m25s)

[instinctively manually do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m28s)

[it and some people get twitchy about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m31s)

[doing it consistently but it's yeah for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m33s)

[for people who want to continue these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m36s)

[because you can do the is it tools](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m38s)

[options I think and then if you do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m41s)

[uh code cleanup here uh and so this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m46s)

[the this is the option here for run code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m49s)

[cleanup profile and save and you can see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m52s)

[you've got multiple profiles to pick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m54s)

[from and And then there's the link to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m56s)

[get into that same screen. So, no good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h10m57s)

[call out there. Thank you. Um, okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m00s)

[library. And then we're going to go and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m12s)

[test. And then we the the hard part is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m14s)

[going to be the naming of this. So, it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m16s)

[going to be bell](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m17s)

[pack. I think if I just call it service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m19s)

[core testing because you'll note there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m23s)

[a subtle difference I've done in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m25s)

[naming. Testing is the libraries test is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m27s)

[the unit test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m30s)

[project. And I think I think we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m35s)

[to go like that. I I think that makes it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m38s)

[better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m41s)

[because and then let's clean you up so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m43s)

[you don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m47s)

[suck. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m48s)

[So you'll know like my band symbols is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m51s)

[already showing up. It's because my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m52s)

[directory build props is doing is doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m54s)

[some heavy lifting for me. So I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m56s)

[what I want to do is I would like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h11m58s)

[copy you into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m00s)

[here. Okay. And then the question is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m05s)

[what do I need? So I need MVC testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m08s)

[brought into here. That's a given. I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m12s)

[going to need SQL light. Both of those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m14s)

[are a given.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m16s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m18s)

[um because this is the whole point of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m20s)

[this separate thing is because I need a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m22s)

[separate set of dependencies that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m24s)

[don't necessarily want to share](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m26s)

[elsewhere. So, and then this thing was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m29s)

[picking up the jot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m32s)

[bearer. Where was that making it in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m35s)

[from? It must be Oh, it's coming in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m38s)

[because I'm referencing the API project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m41s)

[and so it's probably a transitive](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m44s)

[dependency.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m46s)

[that. But I don't want this thing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m48s)

[have to reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h12m50s)

[don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m00s)

[much. Um I appreciate you trying to help](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m10s)

[me, but knock it off. Let's see. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m12s)

[then I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m14s)

[intrinsically like to try to sort these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m17s)

[things because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m19s)

[weird. I I just I I feel better when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m22s)

[things are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m25s)

[in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m27s)

[order.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m29s)

[Yeah. I don't know. For some reason that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m31s)

[that that makes me feel good. Um what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m33s)

[can I say? I'm weird. Uh so web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m36s)

[application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m37s)

[of T program and we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m39s)

[T](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m46s)

[program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m48s)

[and just to avoid naming collisions,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m53s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m56s)

[this just so it's real clear what we've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h13m57s)

[done. Okay, so now it wants generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m03s)

[constraint. Go ahead and add the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m08s)

[constraint for me. Where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m10s)

[the none of those are at the generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m14s)

[constraint fine where t program derives](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m17s)

[class happy? There we go. Okay. So that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m20s)

[has effectively almost everything in it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m25s)

[that I think should occur by](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m28s)

[default. We got to deal with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m31s)

[configure services from the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m33s)

[one. Authenticate async](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m37s)

[Um, so this needs to be changed up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m43s)

[because I need all of the references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m48s)

[that were closing before to not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m50s)

[be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m54s)

[closing. So, we're going to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h14m56s)

[there,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m01s)

[there, and then how many more references](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m06s)

[do we have? Just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m09s)

[those. Okay. So, it's just those. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m11s)

[that should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m13s)

[make you are now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m15s)

[referenced. That That feels better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m19s)

[because now now it actually figures out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m21s)

[how to do it. It's what we want. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m23s)

[got all of the the logging stuff. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m26s)

[got the user context stuff. We're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m28s)

[to break you out into your own](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m30s)

[file. That makes me feel a little more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m32s)

[warm and fuzzy there. And then more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m35s)

[importantly, once we're inside of here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m38s)

[I think we're going to add a project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m41s)

[reference to service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m42s)

[core. And then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m45s)

[I think what we're going to do is we are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m48s)

[going to grab that stripe service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m52s)

[simulator because before I was putting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m55s)

[all of my simulators](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h15m58s)

[here, but I don't think I want that. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m00s)

[I'm going to cut](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m03s)

[you. Go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m06s)

[here. Go add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m08s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m11s)

[simulator. Uh, it was simulators, wasn't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m13s)

[it? Yeah.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m15s)

[There's a general idea that when you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m18s)

[naming namespaces, it's often best to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m20s)

[use a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m23s)

[plural only because when you name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m24s)

[namespaces in a plural, you don't run](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m27s)

[into the the collision when you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m30s)

[have a class of the same name, right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m33s)

[Like it's not uncommon to run into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m36s)

[situation where the the last bit of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m38s)

[namespace often times there's a class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m40s)

[inside of it that you want to match and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m43s)

[that will cause you no end of problems.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m45s)

[And so if your name spaces have a plural](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m49s)

[on the end, you just kind of subtly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m51s)

[sidestep that whole issue and it becomes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m52s)

[less uh of an issue.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h16m56s)

[Okay. So, that that gets me into there,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m00s)

[which means this guy here should now be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m03s)

[able to reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m05s)

[that. Oh, once I change you over to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m09s)

[in the right name](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m12s)

[space. There we go.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m15s)

[And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m18s)

[then and you should be able to get a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m24s)

[reference to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m27s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m29s)

[And can we not I think in this case we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m34s)

[can just reference the simulator's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m37s)

[namespace directly. I think the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m39s)

[one wasn't able to do it because it ran](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m40s)

[a mug. Oh no. That's why because grumble](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m43s)

[grumble grumble grumble grumble.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m47s)

[Um kind of want to clear that off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m52s)

[though. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m55s)

[using fellow pack. Service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h17m59s)

[core core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m03s)

[testing I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m12s)

[wrong. Oh, it's because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m18s)

[Oh, fine. Fine. We'll just do this fully](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m21s)

[qualified and call it a day. Oh, I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m25s)

[have to fight it. Let's see. Uh, in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m27s)

[community tool MVVM, when using](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m28s)

[observable property, is it true that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m30s)

[cannot modify the value being assigned](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m32s)

[to a property with the on property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m35s)

[changing partial method unlike a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m37s)

[traditional property setter where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m39s)

[can adjust the value uh before it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m41s)

[stored? Yes, that is correct. inside of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m44s)

[the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m49s)

[so main window view model. If we open](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m51s)

[this guy up and look at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m54s)

[analyzer because you'll see count is one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m56s)

[there. If we look at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h18m59s)

[uh community toolkit source generators](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m04s)

[and then we look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m06s)

[at property on backing field. Why do you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m08s)

[not show me the generated code?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m11s)

[Come on, show it to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m15s)

[me. I know you have it in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m17s)

[there. Uh, am I Oh, is it this one?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m20s)

[Property generator. There it is.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m25s)

[So if we look at what actually gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m27s)

[generated for it, you'll note here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m29s)

[the the on property changing right that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m33s)

[that ends up uh getting invoked and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m38s)

[value changed like nothing is assigning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m41s)

[back to value or passing by ref value](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m44s)

[in. So if you're trying to leverage like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m47s)

[one of these uh changing methods, it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m50s)

[ends up doing nothing. The only thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m54s)

[you can technically do and you want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m56s)

[be slightly more careful in doing this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h19m58s)

[is there's nothing stopping you from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m02s)

[calling the setter of of your property a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m04s)

[second time. Right? So what I mean is if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m06s)

[you do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m09s)

[uh partial uh on count uh changing,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m11s)

[right? Like there's nothing stopping you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m16s)

[from saying oh actually I want count to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m18s)

[be new value + one. Now do not do this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m21s)

[This will cause a stack](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m24s)

[overflow because now inside of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m26s)

[setter I have recalled the setter with a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m28s)

[new value that's always going to keep](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m30s)

[coming like the only way this works is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m32s)

[if you have something like if count you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m34s)

[know uh less than 10 right like this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m38s)

[needs to be conditionally done right and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m41s)

[so that you don't end up in a in an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m44s)

[infinite loop right of going through and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m47s)

[do but yes it is true that you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m49s)

[cannot you cannot j You cannot mutate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m52s)

[this value as part of it going all the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m55s)

[way through. Again, you can do something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m57s)

[like this, but do it with caution,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h20m58s)

[right? Because I have I have shot myself](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m01s)

[in the foot many a time um doing this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m03s)

[Uh oftentimes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m08s)

[if if you can a slightly uh what I will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m10s)

[often do instead is just give myself a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m14s)

[function that does whatever calculation](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m17s)

[I want to do on the way in and have it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m20s)

[be the thing that calls my my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m22s)

[setter, right? Rather than trying to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m25s)

[it as part of the setter. Um that's one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m27s)

[option. The other thing you can do is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m30s)

[you can always you don't have to always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m33s)

[use the observable property um attribute](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m36s)

[could set the vacuum field](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m40s)

[unchanged. You could right like that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m42s)

[another option right like you could come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m45s)

[through here and do this. Now obviously](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m46s)

[this is in the changing method so this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m48s)

[value gets overwritten right and it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m51s)

[going to the MVVM toolkit analyzer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m53s)

[throws warnings at you but you could do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m55s)

[the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m57s)

[changed right because uh again if we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h21m58s)

[look at the source gen once we hit the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m02s)

[changed nothing else is is like this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m04s)

[the only place where the field gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m07s)

[written to so anywhere down here if you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m08s)

[were to write to the field it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m10s)

[technically works right the other thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m12s)

[though that you can do is You don't have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m16s)

[to use the source generated version of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m18s)

[the property if you don't want right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m20s)

[like it's not it's not terrible you know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m22s)

[private intu right to say you know what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m26s)

[I need to do something interesting here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m29s)

[right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m32s)

[like this is the base like this is what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m33s)

[the source generator is saving you from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m36s)

[so if you want to do something more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m38s)

[interesting you can always just abandon](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m41s)

[the source generator like it's nice and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m43s)

[generates code for you. Um because most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m47s)

[of the time your properties look](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m50s)

[identical. However, if you do run into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m53s)

[situation where you want to change it,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m55s)

[um like Vic called out to me the other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h22m58s)

[day, uh a situation where the desire was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m01s)

[to have a private](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m04s)

[set. Well, you can't do that with the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m06s)

[source generator. So, fully implemented](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m08s)

[the property. Not a bad reason to do it,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m10s)

[right? If you want something of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m13s)

[nature. So, it's it's not a terrible](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m14s)

[idea. If if what the source generator is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m17s)

[doing for you is not quite right, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m21s)

[can always just fall back to to writing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m24s)

[it yourself. Like this used to be the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m26s)

[way before source generators are were a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m29s)

[thing. Like this pattern was what I used](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m32s)

[to teach people for how to properly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m35s)

[implement a property inside of their](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m37s)

[view model. And it was a lot of typing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m40s)

[And then source generators came out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m42s)

[I fell absolutely in love with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m44s)

[them. But yeah, so if if there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m46s)

[something you want to do that's a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m48s)

[more interesting like you can always](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m50s)

[fall back to doing this rather than](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m54s)

[trying to rather than trying to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m55s)

[something hacky around the source](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m57s)

[generator. You can just uh take it out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h23m58s)

[uh do something when food changes.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m02s)

[I don't know. Well, um I I guess it past](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m11s)

[tense perhaps, right? Because after the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m14s)

[call to set property, fu has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m16s)

[changed.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m19s)

[Uh oh, you're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m21s)

[right. That's Thank you, JC. Hold on.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m25s)

[Hold on. That one that one I strongly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m28s)

[suspect is actually wrong in my in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m31s)

[repo on my template.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m34s)

[So, real quick, just just real quick,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m37s)

[we're gonna we're going to pretend like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m40s)

[you saw nothing. There is nothing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m43s)

[there. We're going to just check this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m45s)

[guy out. Look at that. I'm an idiot. I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m48s)

[an idiot. We're just gonna We're just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m52s)

[going to real quick real quick fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m54s)

[that. You're the first one to notice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h24m57s)

[that. Um Yeah, because it came from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m01s)

[right there. Uh to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m04s)

[generate let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m07s)

[unobservable property. Good eye JC, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m10s)

[are on point tonight. Uh yeah, we go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m13s)

[here. Stop it. Go away.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m19s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m22s)

[fixing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m24s)

[observable property](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m26s)

[comment and push.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m30s)

[Just gonna just gonna send that one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m33s)

[right on the way](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m35s)

[in. Okay, I see no problem. It all fixed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m37s)

[now. So, I'll have to push a an update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m40s)

[to the Nougat package at some point, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m44s)

[it's at least checked into the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m47s)

[repository. So, next release it'll go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m48s)

[out. Thank goodness it's not a a scarily](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m50s)

[bad](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m53s)

[change. Okay, so this back to here will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m54s)

[get me a base class that does most of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h25m57s)

[what I want.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m00s)

[And then I don't need you anymore. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m04s)

[this gets me very good setup. So this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m07s)

[web application factory then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m10s)

[becomes Vellopac web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m13s)

[factory. I need to add a project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m16s)

[reference to my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m18s)

[new my new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m20s)

[thingy. That gets me into there. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m23s)

[then I can delete I think this entire](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m25s)

[file because I don't have any](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m29s)

[customization that I wish to do to this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m32s)

[file](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m35s)

[whatsoever.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m38s)

[So that's nice. That makes this is this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m39s)

[this feels warm and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m43s)

[fuzzy. Okay, let's see if we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m45s)

[compiling. And if we aren't, we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m48s)

[to adjust some things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m50s)

[I will say there is there is wisdom in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m54s)

[always slowing down and making sure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m56s)

[you're back in a working state before](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h26m58s)

[you get too carried away with things.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m00s)

[Um, okay. So, this guy is failing, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m02s)

[we're going to come back to him in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m05s)

[minute because we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m06s)

[pull over this endpoint test base, but I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m08s)

[think it's going to go into our new](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m10s)

[project. Uh, let's see. HMAC](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m11s)

[authentication options configuration](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m14s)

[source is inaccessible. Well, that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m16s)

[simple. That's because we moved it into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m19s)

[another project. So, we're just going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m21s)

[bring him](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m23s)

[public. Uh, Stripe Service, you changed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m28s)

[namespaces. So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m33s)

[uh we're going to grab it from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m37s)

[here. At some point we are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m40s)

[change this one up to use the new base](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m43s)

[class but I think for now oh and you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m46s)

[don't have a reference to that project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m50s)

[yet. So service core testing we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m53s)

[to add that in that way this reference](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h27m56s)

[resolves there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m02s)

[We want to get back into a compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m06s)

[state. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m09s)

[then where is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m12s)

[this? There we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m20s)

[go. Okay. So that guy was leveraging](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m23s)

[him. His nameace is now fixed. That goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m26s)

[away. Okay. So this should get us back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m30s)

[into a working state. just compile real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m33s)

[quick and make sure we're running. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m35s)

[and then just in an effort to be real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m38s)

[efficient here, we're going to rerun the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m42s)

[test. Ignore the red. That is that is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m44s)

[from a different branch. I just haven't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m48s)

[run it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m50s)

[on this branch on this machine since I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m51s)

[was working on it. And so, we should be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m54s)

[more or less in the green. I think we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h28m56s)

[aren't. We're going to address any red](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m00s)

[and then circle back cuz right now the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m02s)

[the big thing is the new admin stuff is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m05s)

[untested. But that's okay. We're just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m07s)

[going to make sure all of these tests](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m09s)

[pass. That's making me feel good so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m15s)

[far. Come on. Come](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m21s)

[on. Tunit is fast. I know JC. I know. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m24s)

[want to convert it over to Tunit very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m27s)

[badly. I just I've got I've got a shared](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m29s)

[uh project and so like it will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m32s)

[happen. Arish welcome welcome first](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m36s)

[time. Good to have you. We are having](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m40s)

[fun in ASP.NET Core building web APIs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m42s)

[and at the moment trying to get testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m45s)

[for them in place and refactoring my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m47s)

[universe. Okay, my universe is compiling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m50s)

[and my tests are running. That means my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m53s)

[universe is happy. Okay. So, this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m55s)

[here wants endpoint test base, which I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h29m58s)

[think is over here. And I believe I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m00s)

[to bring this guy in. Yeah. So, this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m03s)

[I would like to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m07s)

[move. Uh, but he is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m10s)

[dependent on temp file test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m12s)

[base, which I'm going to need. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m15s)

[oop, let's uh collection expression that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m19s)

[guy because new stuff is cool. What is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m22s)

[the other blue line? Spelling. Spelling.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m25s)

[Don't care. Don't care. Okay. So, temp](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m28s)

[file test base. I want to move down into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m30s)

[my service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m34s)

[testing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m41s)

[Paste. Yeah. Um, let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m44s)

[here. Then I want the namespace to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m49s)

[updated.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m51s)

[change namespace. Okay, that fixes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m53s)

[that. You still](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h30m57s)

[work. Uh, let's see. I've seen a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m00s)

[devs who are doing C# use Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m03s)

[instead of VS Code, but VS Code feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m06s)

[more modern, elegant. Uh, you're not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m08s)

[wrong. Um, VS Code is very much a built](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m10s)

[with a newer tech stack. Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m17s)

[is it's got a lot of history. So, like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m19s)

[the the comment about feels more modern.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m23s)

[Yeah. Like Visual Studio is not a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m25s)

[product at Microsoft that's owned by a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m28s)

[single team. Like there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m29s)

[different teams and they all own](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m31s)

[different sections and some of the tech](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m32s)

[in here is kind of old. So, I will I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m34s)

[will say that um it does get updates uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m36s)

[like they they'll refresh the UI and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m40s)

[things like that to try to to bring](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m42s)

[things forward. Um there is a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m44s)

[more I think it depends on what people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m47s)

[are looking for. If you want a lot more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m49s)

[of like the fullfeatured IDE with those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m51s)

[deep debugging experience and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m54s)

[profiling and the integration and all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m56s)

[that, Visual Studio far outplays VS](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h31m58s)

[Code. Um, VS Code used to have OmniSharp](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m01s)

[and then their new, what do they call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m04s)

[it? The like the C dev kit, I think is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m06s)

[the name of it. Um, which is good, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m09s)

[like it's somewhat simplistic in what it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m14s)

[offers at this point compared to Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m17s)

[Studio. like they're trying to build out](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m19s)

[the C# dev kit because they they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m21s)

[obsoleted Visual Studio for Mac and so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m25s)

[right now VS Code with the C# DevKit is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m28s)

[solution and it just feels like it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m33s)

[lacking right now. Um and so yeah,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m35s)

[there's a lot of stuff that's missing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m38s)

[Like it is it is nowhere close to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m40s)

[feature parody. Um and part of it is is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m42s)

[because Visual Studio has been built up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m45s)

[over decades. Um I think the first](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m47s)

[release was in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m50s)

[98 something of that nature. So when I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m53s)

[say decades like I'm not exaggerating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m56s)

[much like it is it is year old.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h32m59s)

[Um, so or at least that's when it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m03s)

[started. And some code dates back, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m06s)

[don't doubt probably 10 plus years easy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m08s)

[in some areas because occasionally you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m11s)

[run into stuff and you're like, whoa,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m13s)

[that is clearly not been updated in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m15s)

[very long time. Um, but yeah, with that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m17s)

[said, it is if you were on Windows,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m22s)

[Visual Studio does kind of offer that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m24s)

[premier experience. There's a handful of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m27s)

[features in like their pro and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m29s)

[enterprise tier that are very nice](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m31s)

[specifically around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m34s)

[um some of the more advanced like live](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m37s)

[unit testing features and some more of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m39s)

[those kind of integrated experiences. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m41s)

[if you're on the free tier of Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m44s)

[Studio um the community](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m46s)

[edition, it's going to be a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m49s)

[closer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m51s)

[to to to what you might get in VS Code.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m52s)

[And so there's a a fair judgment call to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m56s)

[be made there. Um, for anybody on a Mac,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h33m58s)

[honestly, uh, Jet Brains Writer is no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m01s)

[slouch when it comes to a a really good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m05s)

[IDE experience. Um, my my personal](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m08s)

[preference, if I am building like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m11s)

[something crossplatform and I'm on a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m13s)

[Mac, I'm I'm reaching for Writer as my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m14s)

[IDE. Like, it's not bad. It's it's it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m17s)

[really good. Um, for people who have a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m21s)

[lot of muscle memory with Visual Studio,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m24s)

[it's a little different. If you ran](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m26s)

[ReSharper with Visual Studio, Ryder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m28s)

[feels very familiar. Uh, because a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m30s)

[of that like same company makes Ryder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m32s)

[and ReSharper. So there there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m35s)

[symmetry there. It's just Ryder is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m37s)

[IDE that ReSharper tries to make Visual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m41s)

[Studio into. Um, it's just that because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m44s)

[Visual Studio is an extension, it can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m46s)

[only do so much. Whereas Ryder, it's the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m48s)

[full ID. they can sky's the limit. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m50s)

[um yeah, I guess that that would be my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m55s)

[thought. Again, VS Code is not bad and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m57s)

[especially if you're doing crossplatform](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h34m59s)

[stuff or you're doing anything web-](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m01s)

[based. Um like most of the people I work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m04s)

[with, like even myself, if I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m07s)

[work on like the front-end website, um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m09s)

[I'm reaching for VS Code to do my React](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m12s)

[stuff, not Visual Studio. Uh, but if I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m14s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m16s)

[C, anything that's remotely serious, I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m18s)

[probably jumping back into Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m21s)

[rather than doing it in VS Code. If it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m23s)

[quick and easy, like we just did the um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m25s)

[the edit to the .NET template and I did](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m28s)

[the the VS Code in the browser to to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m30s)

[edit it right there in line on GitHub](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m33s)

[because it's like eh it's quick, it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m34s)

[easy. And I think that's where VS Code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m36s)

[really shines is for a lot of people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m38s)

[it's that quick easy editor that they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m41s)

[can reach for. Um, and for some people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m43s)

[it makes for a full IDE experience, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m45s)

[it really does rely heavily on its](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m49s)

[extensions to provide that IDE](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m51s)

[experience. And the C# DevKit feature](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m54s)

[forfeature is way behind Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h35m57s)

[mostly because it's way behind in years](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m00s)

[of development, too, because it was just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m02s)

[released last year, I think. So, it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m04s)

[yeah, like it's moving fast and it'll](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m08s)

[probably get a lot of good features. In](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m12s)

[a few years, it might be a a a much](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m14s)

[better competitor, especially in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m16s)

[cross-platform universe.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m18s)

[But for now, if you're on Windows doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m20s)

[net, Visual Studio is kind of your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m25s)

[premier experience with I think Writer](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m27s)

[taking second and then maybe VS Code in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m30s)

[third. But it's like things things start](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m33s)

[dropping off when you get into third](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m36s)

[place. Those are my two cents. Uh did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m38s)

[move endpoint test base? No, I did not.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m41s)

[Uh that is the next thing I would like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m43s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m45s)

[move. We're going to pick you up. Put](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m46s)

[you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m49s)

[down. Okay. And then this needs to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m52s)

[uh so I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h36m58s)

[want I'm going to need to make you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m03s)

[generic is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m05s)

[problem. T program and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m09s)

[think I just do this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m12s)

[Um, let's if I change the name space](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m21s)

[that'll fix the the missing using there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m23s)

[because now they should be alongside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m27s)

[each](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m28s)

[other.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m29s)

[Um, oh, didn't change that name space.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m34s)

[So, that caught a bug. So, that was](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m37s)

[nice. Okay, so those two are alongside](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m39s)

[each other. This guy now needs](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m41s)

[a where program is there. And then this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m44s)

[is probably just going to need to change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m47s)

[up to be more like this and more like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m49s)

[this. And this is going to be I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m52s)

[know why I had that as public. If you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m55s)

[have a an abstract class, it's rare to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h37m57s)

[ever need the constructor as public](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m00s)

[because by definition an abstract class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m02s)

[is must be um subclassed. So often times](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m05s)

[an abstract class will the constructor](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m10s)

[will just be uh protected. Let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m13s)

[What do you think about the this whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m17s)

[AI replacing software developers? That](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m18s)

[is a great question and very much a hot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m21s)

[topic thing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m24s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m26s)

[I I do not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m28s)

[think that AI is going to com like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m31s)

[think AI will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m34s)

[change how software developers work. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m36s)

[don't think it's going to replace](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m40s)

[software](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m41s)

[developers, right? Like in in ye olden](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m42s)

[days, people did punch cards and they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m45s)

[wrote assembly and it was all this very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m47s)

[low-level stuff and it was hard to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m49s)

[and and then we got uh better tooling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m51s)

[and higher abstraction languages and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m54s)

[things kind of moved up higher and for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m56s)

[the most part we don't have to think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h38m59s)

[about lower level stuff right now. Like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m01s)

[I write C. I don't usually have to think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m02s)

[about the underlying IL or any of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m06s)

[stuff. And so I think AI will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m09s)

[potentially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m12s)

[bring another layer up perhaps of what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m13s)

[we have. What that ends up looking like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m17s)

[is kind of weird because it's not it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m18s)

[not generating great code yet. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m22s)

[there's a lot of people who are like,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m24s)

["Oh, it's but it it it will soon in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m25s)

[future." I'm like, I don't doubt that it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m27s)

[can get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m29s)

[better. But right now like it's barely](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m31s)

[junior level and like it it causes more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m34s)

[mistakes. And so like I think what is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m40s)

[more likely to occur is the the low code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m43s)

[no code solutions that people have like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m47s)

[the Microsoft Power Apps type situation.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m50s)

[I think AI will make those types of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m52s)

[solutions more prominent and better](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m56s)

[because right now they're kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m58s)

[limited in what they can do. But once](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h39m59s)

[you start adding in some AI for people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m01s)

[who may not know how to dive deep into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m03s)

[the code, it's going to give them a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m05s)

[of options where they where they might](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m07s)

[be able to start solving problems that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m10s)

[they otherwise wouldn't be able to. So I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m11s)

[think that area will get bigger and will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m13s)

[probably in some ways replace what](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m17s)

[otherwise would have been a custom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m20s)

[developer solution, right? Where you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m21s)

[needed a dev, now you've got these low](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m22s)

[code people that can solve more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m24s)

[problems. So maybe you don't need custom](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m26s)

[software in all those cases.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m28s)

[But consistently, it's always been the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m31s)

[developers who understand what's kind of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m34s)

[going on under the covers tend to become](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m36s)

[the better developers. And I think this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m39s)

[I don't think AI is going to change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m42s)

[that. It's going to be the developers](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m44s)

[who understand what's going on, who can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m45s)

[better evaluate like the output that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m48s)

[they're getting from the AI. Um the ones](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m51s)

[who understand how the underlying code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m54s)

[works, who can evaluate the AA's output](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m56s)

[and go, "Yeah, no." like that may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h40m58s)

[compile that may run and do the thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m00s)

[but no we are not doing that that's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m02s)

[horrible idea right those types of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m04s)

[things I think the like I don't see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m06s)

[those types of good developers going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m10s)

[away and then people always talk about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m13s)

[the the supply chain effectively of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m15s)

[developers right like if AI replaces all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m18s)

[our junior developers where are we going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m19s)

[to get senior developers right like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m21s)

[there has to be a pipeline up and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m23s)

[think AI is likely to accelerate the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m25s)

[learning Like I've noticed even in my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m29s)

[usage of it, it makes it much easier for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m31s)

[me to quickly learn things or get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m34s)

[through problems. Like it's it's fairly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m37s)

[good at that. Like even if especially](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m39s)

[when I don't know like the right things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m42s)

[to put into the Googles to get the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m44s)

[information that I need oftentimes going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m46s)

[back and forth with co-pilot, I will](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m49s)

[start to figure out the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m51s)

[terminology and the things that I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m52s)

[to put into Google to get to the right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m54s)

[thing. even if it doesn't solve my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m55s)

[problem, it can oftentimes hint me in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m57s)

[the right direction and it can often](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h41m59s)

[times help me learn new concepts,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m01s)

[especially because most of the time it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m04s)

[like memorize the docs. So, it's usually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m06s)

[pretty good where it's like, okay, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m08s)

[don't want to waste my time sifting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m10s)

[through docs to find this. Just give me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m11s)

[the answer from the docs. Like, I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m13s)

[going to go Google this anyway. Save me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m14s)

[some time. And it's really good for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m16s)

[that. So, I think it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m18s)

[will not kill off juniors, but I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m20s)

[it will potentially accelerate how fast](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m24s)

[people move through that junior stage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m27s)

[because I think it has the potential of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m30s)

[improving learning when used well as a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m32s)

[tool, right? Like it's just a tool. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m35s)

[not it's not anything more than than a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m38s)

[very advanced tool that that people are](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m41s)

[leveraging, right? people are getting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m42s)

[very excited about these AI experiences](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m44s)

[that that people are building like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m46s)

[Microsoft is building out like um all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m48s)

[these co-pilot type experiences and like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m51s)

[it's important to remember these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m54s)

[co-pilot experiences that Microsoft is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m55s)

[building out are not one AI engine like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h42m57s)

[there's a lot of layers and complexity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m00s)

[in these systems and there's a lot of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m02s)

[different pieces and different AI agents](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m04s)

[working together so this is not just one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m06s)

[oh you have an AI thing and now poof](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m09s)

[look you can generate this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m11s)

[Um, yeah, and AI putting you down the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m14s)

[wrong path. Like that is that is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m17s)

[consistent problem in in that that often](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m18s)

[happens quite a bit. And so like I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m23s)

[very happy to use Copilot in my code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m25s)

[because oftentimes especially for for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m27s)

[refactors and and little things like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m30s)

[middlegen stuff and do an awesome job](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m33s)

[like especially repetitive boring things](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m35s)

[I'm very happy to do it when it gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m38s)

[complicated or or things where I know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m40s)

[it's important. I'm very likely to not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m42s)

[use it because I don't I don't trust it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m44s)

[to be accurate or I'll let it jen and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m46s)

[then I'll go back over it with a fine](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m48s)

[tooth comb because it's like how do I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m49s)

[know that you didn't screw this up,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m52s)

[right? The same as what I would do is if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m54s)

[I if I hand a real important task to a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m56s)

[junior developer, I'm probably going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m58s)

[scrutinize it harder, scrutinize the AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h43m59s)

[just as hard. So, I think that like I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m02s)

[think it'll fundamentally change how](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m06s)

[things work. I think the low code, no](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m08s)

[code solutions are likely to expand](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m10s)

[quite a bit. Um, and potentially I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m12s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m15s)

[where the the loss of developer jobs may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m16s)

[go, right? It's not necessarily going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m20s)

[be AI taking the jobs, but it's AI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m22s)

[enhancing the low code, no code um, app](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m25s)

[builders so that they can move into a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m29s)

[bigger space and solve more problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m32s)

[that they otherwise couldn't where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m34s)

[previously people would have to hire a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m36s)

[developer to do. I think those jobs may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m37s)

[go away and but they](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m40s)

[aren't like yes they're going away from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m42s)

[a developer but it's not like the it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m45s)

[not like the problem goes away right the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m46s)

[company still has the problem that those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m48s)

[apps are solving um I just think that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m50s)

[those those kind of low code no code](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m53s)

[solution people will will start eating](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m56s)

[some of those easier problems or more](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h44m58s)

[simplistic type software um and I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m01s)

[that's potentially where there might be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m03s)

[jobs lost but I don't See, I don't see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m05s)

[software engineering going away. Like,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m09s)

[I'm not worried about it replacing me](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m13s)

[during my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m16s)

[lifetime. So, and if my kids told me,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m17s)

[hey, I want to go into computer science,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m20s)

[I would not discourage them from it. I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m22s)

[think it's still a a very viable thing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m25s)

[I think it's it's different, right? Like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m27s)

[when I went to school it was, you know,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m30s)

[C and C++ and now it's a little more oh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m31s)

[well let's let's teach Python and C and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m34s)

[some of these other things like okay](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m37s)

[right like the the field advances and I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m39s)

[think it's just going to kind of push](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m42s)

[that abstraction up a little higher but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m43s)

[I don't think it goes away changes sure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m46s)

[I think that's probably a given at this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m49s)

[point but I don't think it's some people](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m50s)

[are doom and gloom and freaking out and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m53s)

[I'm I'm not that concerned.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m56s)

[because people who can solve problems](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h45m59s)

[and build solutions there is a high](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m01s)

[demand. So I think that's the key thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m06s)

[I would tell people is focus on learning](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m08s)

[how to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m10s)

[build build solutions and then it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m11s)

[doesn't matter whether it's with C with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m15s)

[AI right if you can build a quality](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m17s)

[solution that stands up that's at the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m20s)

[end of the day that's what people want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m22s)

[they want software to solve a problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m24s)

[for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m26s)

[them and software engineers are just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m27s)

[generally the people tasked with doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m30s)

[that but again power apps people may may](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m32s)

[start doing it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m36s)

[start doing a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m38s)

[more because I I I I have felt that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m39s)

[those low code solutions or like the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m42s)

[app generators or quick go from idea to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m44s)

[prototypes things like they generally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m47s)

[don't do a great job and now I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m49s)

[that they they actually might be able to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m52s)

[start doing a better job. Oh Harris,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m54s)

[thank you for the follow. I appreciate](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m56s)

[it. Hopefully I'm not making everything](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h46m59s)

[too uh doom and gloom for you.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m01s)

[Okay. So, that should go there. And then](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m05s)

[this,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m08s)

[uh, no, don't do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m10s)

[that. Uh, let's see. So, this I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m13s)

[be still want this to be web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m17s)

[factory. Why are you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m21s)

[unhappy? Do you not appropriately drive?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m24s)

[Oh, you don't. I need you to be fellow](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m28s)

[pack web application factory.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m32s)

[that way. Okay. So, I am going to have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m35s)

[to convert you over as soon as I change](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m37s)

[the space class. Okay. So, but we'll get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m38s)

[through that in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m41s)

[moment. Uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m43s)

[see. This does not contain access to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m46s)

[this. Why not? It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m49s)

[protected. Am I an idiot? Isn't that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m54s)

[what protected means? There's your](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m56s)

[problem. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h47m58s)

[Oh, it's because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m06s)

[haven't got it. Okay. I've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m08s)

[conflicting. I need to deal with this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m12s)

[before that's going to work. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m14s)

[Okay. Maybe I should address that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m16s)

[first. Can't decide. Probably worth](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m20s)

[probably worth probably worth addressing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m23s)

[this first. Okay. So, this exists in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m25s)

[base class. Kill it. This exists in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m28s)

[with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m41s)

[that. None of this needs to change.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m42s)

[Configure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m45s)

[is currently the same in the base class,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m49s)

[though I'm realizing. No, that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m52s)

[probably fine. Okay. This is where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m54s)

[things are going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m57s)

[to change a little](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h48m59s)

[bit. Um, because I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m03s)

[want these things to get added because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m08s)

[this guy is referencing extra stuff that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m12s)

[the other one isn't. So, let me look at](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m14s)

[what collapse those two guys](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m16s)

[up. Okay. So, what got saved down here?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m20s)

[So you need So I don't need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m24s)

[you, right? I am going to need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m26s)

[you. Um let's see. File upload message Q](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m30s)

[needs to stay. Storage needs to stay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m34s)

[Stripe service can go. Logger can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m37s)

[go. Uh DB context can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m41s)

[go. Registering](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m45s)

[self. Oh, this is interesting.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m48s)

[This is interesting. So there so these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m54s)

[two lines here are not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h49m57s)

[equal. This is what's weird. So in C the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m00s)

[this add singleton you'll note here on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m05s)

[the left. Oh, see if I can crab that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m08s)

[again. Right. So you'll note this is add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m10s)

[singleton web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m13s)

[non-generic. Right? This is the fully uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m15s)

[derived class type. Right? But if I go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m18s)

[here, right, this one is bellopac web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m21s)

[program and this is this is very subtle](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m28s)

[because the the lines look identical and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m31s)

[when I copied from a to b and redid the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m34s)

[class it like I didn't have to touch](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m36s)

[this code but it infers the generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m38s)

[parameter because of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m41s)

[this and this is not the same on the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m43s)

[left and the right and I think we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m46s)

[going to kill this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m48s)

[because I don't I don't think there is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m50s)

[anything that is trying to resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m53s)

[from honestly I don't know why I need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h50m59s)

[either of them. So, we're going to whack](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m01s)

[them both because I don't I'm curious](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m02s)

[what is trying to resolve the factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m05s)

[the web application factory itself. It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m08s)

[probably some extension I've built](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m10s)

[but I can't remember what pass Kevin did](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m13s)

[and pass Kevin didn't leave me a note.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m16s)

[So, we're going to delete it. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m18s)

[see. Authentication handler is done.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m21s)

[Authorization is done. Email client mock](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m24s)

[is not. So, we need to keep this and the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m28s)

[for each. And I think what I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m30s)

[do is I am going to inject this call](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m33s)

[back above the call to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m37s)

[base because most of these things were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m39s)

[registered first. But it shouldn't make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m42s)

[any difference. These](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m44s)

[are Well, shoot hold on. This is calling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m46s)

[base. So I or it's calling replace. So I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m49s)

[need the base registration to occur](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m53s)

[first. Wait a carac is making it hard to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h51m56s)

[read. Okay. Um that goes like](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m00s)

[that. Authenticate async. I don't think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m04s)

[we need any of this. All the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m07s)

[authentication stuff remains the same](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m09s)

[for now. We might have to do something](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m13s)

[funky when we get around to dealing with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m15s)

[the HMAX stuff, but we haven't gotten](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m17s)

[there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m19s)

[yet. We're going to get rid of this. Get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m20s)

[rid of this. Get rid of user](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m23s)

[context. Eight minutes until a very,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m26s)

[very special announcement. Here's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m29s)

[hint. It's midnight for me. Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m32s)

[okay. That goes like that. That goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m36s)

[like that. That goes like that. Good.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m38s)

[Good. Good. Okay. Close that. And if I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m41s)

[go back here now, what is your problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m42s)

[here? Lac web application program does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m47s)

[not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m51s)

[contain a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m51s)

[factory. Sure. Post requires.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h52m57s)

[Oh, this is the authentication. Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m00s)

[these are the extension methods I wrote.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m04s)

[That's why I can't find them. So up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m06s)

[here I have these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m11s)

[guys. Um I think we want to move this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m18s)

[down as well into service testing. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m22s)

[these are extension methods that I can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m25s)

[feed URLs to and they're just there to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m27s)

[make sure that I don't botch my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m30s)

[authentication stuff, right? If a if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m32s)

[something requires it to be an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m35s)

[authenticated call, it intentionally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m37s)

[makes a call without it being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m39s)

[authenticated](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m41s)

[um and just asserts that it gets an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m42s)

[unauthorized. No more it's no more fancy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m45s)

[than that.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m47s)

[So if we move this down here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m49s)

[um change name space to match folder](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m57s)

[structure and then this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h53m59s)

[uh velopac](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m06s)

[uh t program.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m10s)

[Then the key part here is we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m15s)

[put the generic parameter on the method](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m16s)

[um uh let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m22s)

[see simply for one reason um because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m24s)

[same the same thing that that caused the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m28s)

[confusion with the registration of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m31s)

[this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m33s)

[parameter we can abuse that same thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m36s)

[so that we don't have to go and update](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m38s)

[all of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m40s)

[code. So if I do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m41s)

[this t](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m45s)

[program and so we'll let it we'll let](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m47s)

[the compiler infer. I'm going to just do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m49s)

[this. That makes me feel better. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m52s)

[let's see. Uh where tp program is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h54m54s)

[class. Oh I didn't add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m00s)

[it. We go. There we go. There we go.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m07s)

[Okay. So that gets me to there. That](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m10s)

[gets me to there. We are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m11s)

[do this maneuver. Actually, I think](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m14s)

[we're just going to do this maneuver.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m17s)

[Now, I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m19s)

[go important to make the sound. That's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m21s)

[very important. Uh, and then we're going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m24s)

[to grab T](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m26s)

[program there.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m29s)

[There.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m32s)

[There. Right. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m35s)

[grab the wear](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m37s)

[clause. And we're just going to slap it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m39s)

[in. Fix my indentation that I clearly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m43s)

[botched somewhere along the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m45s)

[line. Clean that up. Clean that up.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m48s)

[Clean that up. Okay. So, all of those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m50s)

[now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m52s)

[work. And what that means is this guy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m53s)

[now magically compiles. And so he has](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m56s)

[now inferred the appropriate generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h55m58s)

[parameter. I don't have to do so. And so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m00s)

[all of these this code that I've written](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m03s)

[previously just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m05s)

[works, right? That's the game](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m06s)

[plan. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m09s)

[So this guy now exists and works](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m12s)

[great. So now it means that each time I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m16s)

[spin one of these new test classes,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m18s)

[which I'm going to need to do one for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m20s)

[the partner side in addition to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m22s)

[admin side. So I'm going to have to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m23s)

[this another time. So part of why I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m24s)

[refactoring this is because I know I am](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m27s)

[going to get hosed by this later.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m29s)

[Okay. So the change here is to bring](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m32s)

[in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m36s)

[program on all of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m40s)

[these. And what is your problem?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h56m44s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m04s)

[interesting. How did I handle it here? I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m05s)

[didn't. Factory does not have a fixture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m11s)

[source. If it comes from a collection](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m15s)

[definition, assume the definition is the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m18s)

[same assembly as the test.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m20s)

[Oh, am I going to need to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m24s)

[do I don't know if I can class fixture](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m26s)

[this. Uh I don't think I can class](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m29s)

[fixture this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m31s)

[in because of that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m34s)

[limitation. Bothers me because I know](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m38s)

[I'm going to have to change this when](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m40s)

[um I switch to TUN because it handles](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m46s)

[this slightly differently.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m48s)

[But now that fixes that. But secretly](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m50s)

[what I actually want to copy is that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m53s)

[whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m55s)

[line, right? And so then when I go here,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m55s)

[I actually just want to paste that and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h57m58s)

[then it fixes it. Because at the end of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m00s)

[the day, XUnit uses class fixture to say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m03s)

[here's how you inject the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m06s)

[constructor parameter. And because the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m09s)

[base class is abstract, it's not going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m11s)

[to be creating that class. It's going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m14s)

[be creating one of these](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m16s)

[instead. Okay. So, let's close this.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m17s)

[Close this. Close this. I F8](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m20s)

[paste. That's good. So, hopefully it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m25s)

[as simple as just F8 paste. F8 paste. F8](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m28s)

[paste.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m33s)

[Um, may come back to that public surface](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m38s)

[API test here in a bit because that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m40s)

[that's the first test we want to have.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m43s)

[Uh, let's see. This one already had it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m49s)

[So, that's weird. Feels like I made a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m52s)

[mistake somewhere along the line or and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m54s)

[didn't clean something up, but that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h58m56s)

[okay. Okay, compile.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m00s)

[And once we get this guy rolling.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m05s)

[Why is this one not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m14s)

[using? I'm just looking because this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m31s)

[the user stuff. I'm wondering is there a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m34s)

[reason I did this one differently? I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m36s)

[don't think there](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m38s)

[is. Okay.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m42s)

[I think I just failed to update one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m54s)

[these.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=02h59m58s)

[Um, we'll get this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m02s)

[guy updated to match because they I I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m05s)

[don't know why any of these things would](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m08s)

[be different.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m10s)

[Then all of that continues to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m14s)

[work. In reality, this is actually a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m18s)

[constructors. But](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m22s)

[uh let's see. Have you found in TUN that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m28s)

[you can't rightclick in VS and run debug](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m30s)

[a test? Oh, just like the menus right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m33s)

[here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m36s)

[Um, I have not seen that, JC. Um, if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m38s)

[you're running into that,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m42s)

[so I don't know if that would be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m46s)

[T-Unit issue as much as that might be a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m48s)

[um, what is it called? The new testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m53s)

[framework. So, when I did my stream](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m56s)

[about upgrading to TUNI, there were](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h00m59s)

[subtly the two things that we upgraded](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m01s)

[because it's the the Microsoft I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m03s)

[remember what sucker is called.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m05s)

[the MA that's the acronym I'm looking](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m18s)

[for. Um I suspect it's probably actually](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m20s)

[MTP that's breaking because that's where](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m25s)

[the integration is. Um XUnit still](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m28s)

[works, but which XUnit is it? XUnit 3](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m31s)

[with MTP or not?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m35s)

[because I would imagine it's probably an](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m37s)

[MTP failure](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m40s)

[versus a TUNT one. So, and I I realize](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m43s)

[that this is probably subtle. So, TUNT](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m47s)

[is only built for M for Microsoft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m50s)

[testing platform. It won't run](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m53s)

[elsewhere. So, if you're on TUnit, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m54s)

[have to be running the new Microsoft](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h01m56s)

[um VS test because VS test is the old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m48s)

[system that they have where when you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m52s)

[rightclick and run there is it's got the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m54s)

[outofband test runner. It has to load](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h02m58s)

[the assemblies and do all of this stuff.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m00s)

[Whereas](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m03s)

[MTP it's um you'll note the the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m05s)

[compilation output of your test project](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m08s)

[just becomes a standard XE. So it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m10s)

[nothing fancy. It's literally just an XU](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m13s)

[uh it's just an a standalone executable](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m16s)

[because you can actually take the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m18s)

[compilation from an MTP project and just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m19s)

[go run that XI somewhere. That's it,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m22s)

[right? It's no more like it's that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m24s)

[simple. No more needing to run net test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m26s)

[blah blah blah. But there's still that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m28s)

[integration back and forth. And so I if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m30s)

[it's falling](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m33s)

[over I I'm tempted to blame it here. Um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m35s)

[if it's not working, the other thing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m38s)

[be aware of is where is it? Is it it up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m41s)

[here? Where's the submit feedback](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m44s)

[here. This this little guy up here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m49s)

[Um, definitely send a feedback report on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m54s)

[on something like that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m57s)

[because I because it's the new thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h03m59s)

[with all of the changes and whatnot. If](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m02s)

[there's going to be bugs, I'm I'm real](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m04s)

[keen on blaming the new thing. It could](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m06s)

[still be a T-Unit issue, but because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m08s)

[you're talking about like the rightclick](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m11s)

[interaction in Visual Studio, I suspect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m13s)

[it's more likely Visual Studio's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m15s)

[integration with MTP and less the actual](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m18s)

[compiled. Okay, so now let's go back](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m34s)

[here. test. Run all tests. Let's re](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m37s)

[Let's rerun. I want to make sure that I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m39s)

[haven't broken anything. I should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m41s)

[probably be making commits as I go.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m43s)

[Honestly, not making commits is probably](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m46s)

[going to hose me because at some point](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m49s)

[I'm going to need to go backwards and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m51s)

[figure out what the heck I did. And I've](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m52s)

[been running all night with zero commit.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m55s)

[See, I broke something. I broke](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m57s)

[something. Something very fundamental](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h04m58s)

[apparently. Okay, let's just pick on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m01s)

[Uh, I'm sorry, not what I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m08s)

[wanted. Clean that up. What was the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m11s)

[actual failure? So, response status does](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m13s)

[not indicate success. Well, what a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m15s)

[shock, right? Uh, 500 internal server](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m17s)

[error. So, that's not useful. We're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m21s)

[going to debug the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m24s)

[test and we're going to go with](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m28s)

[Spelunkin and see where the heck this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m30s)

[thing fell over.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m32s)

[I imagine it's going to be somewhere in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m34s)

[the DI](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m36s)

[Jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m42s)

[in. Jump out. Jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m44s)

[in. Okay, you are not being](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m49s)

[helpful. Okay, not a helpful response.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m55s)

[Let me just look at are the are are all](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h05m58s)

[of these going to be similar?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m00s)

[Okay. Unable to resolve service lookup.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m03s)

[See, there we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m05s)

[go. Look at that. So, it is that resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m08s)

[this. What did I write that leverages](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m16s)

[it? Because I I assume I had to write](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m22s)

[something that leveraged it. But it is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m25s)

[attempting to resolve the web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m27s)

[application factory when attempting to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m30s)

[activate. Oh, the test off handler is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m33s)

[what's doing Oh. Oh, okay. Okay. Got it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m36s)

[Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m41s)

[Got it. Got it. Got it. Got it. This is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m42s)

[actually probably worthwhile thing to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m44s)

[slow down and explain. Right. So, this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m45s)

[is uh I saw a tweet the other day that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m48s)

[said, "If you can explain dependency](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m51s)

[injection to people, you're ahead of 90%](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m52s)

[of developers." It's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m54s)

[like I don't know if that's accurate but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m56s)

[it it definitely is one of the bars that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h06m59s)

[I look at with people. So the key thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m01s)

[here unable to resolve service for type.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m03s)

[The moment you see this message this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m05s)

[a dependency injection issue. Right? You](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m07s)

[either haven't registered something or](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m10s)

[the service type that you're trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m12s)

[look up is different than what you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m13s)

[registered as or something. Right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m15s)

[Effectively it's I tried to get a thingy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m16s)

[and I couldn't find the thingy so I went](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m19s)

[boom. Right? That's that's what the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m21s)

[exception means.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m23s)

[But so it's attempting to resolve](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m25s)

[service for type and so this is the type](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m27s)

[that it's looking for and you'll note](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m30s)

[this is our Velopac web application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m32s)

[factory and the back tick one here this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m34s)

[is the this is the way that generic](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m37s)

[types get tworing right so if you see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m40s)

[back tick one what you know is that is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m42s)

[generic type with a single with an arity](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m45s)

[of one so a single generic parameter and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m48s)

[in this case because it's a closed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m50s)

[generic meaning We know the value of the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m54s)

[t that's inside of it. We know that it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m56s)

[programmed. So we know this is it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h07m58s)

[looking to resolve over a closed type,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m00s)

[right? Uh while attempting to activate.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m03s)

[So while attempting to activate means](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m06s)

[this other thingy has a dependency on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m09s)

[this thingy, right? So when trying to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m13s)

[call the constructor for this other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m16s)

[type that constructor likely has a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m19s)

[parameter that points at this right. So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m22s)

[if we go look at web application factory](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m24s)

[and you'll note back tick one. So the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m27s)

[generic class and then the plus means](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m29s)

[nested class. So inside of web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m32s)

[application factory here there is a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m35s)

[class called test off handler.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m38s)

[It inherits the generic type program](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m42s)

[from](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m45s)

[there. So what we need to do is we need](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m46s)

[to go look at this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m50s)

[guy. Boom. So you'll note there he is in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m52s)

[our class and there is the registration.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h08m56s)

[So this is the constructor parameter](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m00s)

[that it was looking for. And so my](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m01s)

[comment before about I didn't know which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m04s)

[one of those services registered this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m06s)

[was the appropriate one to do. In this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m08s)

[case, I want because I know that this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m11s)

[the guy looking for him. This test off](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m13s)

[handler. I know that um the generic one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m16s)

[with T program not the one not the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m20s)

[derived class is the one that I want to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m23s)

[register as. So, I come down here and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m24s)

[we're going to go uh services add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m28s)

[singleton this and present Kevin knows](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m33s)

[that he should leave a comment so that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m36s)

[future Kevin doesn't delete this one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m38s)

[like he did last time. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m40s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m45s)

[here. Uh where did it go? Where did it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m46s)

[go? Uh this is used by test o handler](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m49s)

[to find the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h09m56s)

[uh parent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m00s)

[factory. There we go. See? Simple as](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m02s)

[that. Now we're going to just run one of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m05s)

[these tests to make sure that I fixed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m07s)

[the obvious problem before we send them](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m09s)

[all. Okay, that worked. So now we run](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m13s)

[the whole suite.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m15s)

[Make sure everything else is working.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m18s)

[But now that the one worked, it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m20s)

[probably that most of these are going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m21s)

[flare out. Okay, so we still have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m24s)

[something that's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m26s)

[broken. Click on one of these ones to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m27s)

[take a look at. So, we always want to go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m30s)

[from working to working. So, let's see](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m32s)

[what is broken here. It's weird that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m35s)

[there's so](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m37s)

[many. Uh, status code not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m39s)

[found. Oh, I'm sorry. Expected not](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m43s)

[found, but found internal server error.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m45s)

[Ah okay. So this is same problem](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m52s)

[different different symptoms. Oh even](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m56s)

[better even better. Right. So this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h10m58s)

[now attempting to use the derived web](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m02s)

[application](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m04s)

[factory while attempting to activate and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m05s)

[in this case it's the simulator local](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m08s)

[file storage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m10s)

[manager. Right. So when I said I don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m12s)

[see why we need this. I'm going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m15s)

[delete both. What I should have said is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m17s)

[this is clearly needed and I should keep](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m19s)

[both. So, you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m21s)

[know, not my not my finest moment. Um,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m24s)

[let's jump](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m29s)

[here and then go up to the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m30s)

[top. Uh, let's see. And I want to go to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m34s)

[web application factory. And in](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m37s)

[here we will do services.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m41s)

[uh register](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m45s)

[uh add](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m48s)

[singleton. This](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m50s)

[uh this is needed by the uh local uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h11m55s)

[file storage](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m01s)

[manager. Yeah, that's probably good](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m04s)

[enough. Yep. And at some point, if this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m09s)

[guy moves into the core, we'll be able](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m11s)

[to delete it. But for now, while he](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m14s)

[lives up here, uh, it needs to exist. We](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m16s)

[will come back up here. We will rerun](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m20s)

[this one guy. Make sure he passes. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m22s)

[then if he does, we send it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m25s)

[all. Oh, still failed. No, that one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m32s)

[passed. All right.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m36s)

[top level node still showed failed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m38s)

[because it contained failed](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m40s)

[test. Okay, we are working. So, we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m47s)

[going to make a commit really](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m49s)

[quick. Uh, and I am going to hit the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m51s)

[auto code button or the auto comment](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m54s)

[button. Uh, validation off logic to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m57s)

[service](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h12m59s)

[core. Uh, service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m00s)

[project. Uh, you missed you missed most](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m03s)

[of it.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m07s)

[Um, added implementation to admin API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m09s)

[service. Okay, so there goes](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m15s)

[that. We're going to push that while I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m19s)

[here. So, that gets me there. That gets](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m21s)

[me there. Oh, we passed midnight. So, it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m24s)

[is now my birthday. Yay. Okay, moving](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m28s)

[right along. Uh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m32s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m34s)

[So we have that. We have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m37s)

[that. These are now in here. Now we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m45s)

[back to the public ser. So the whole](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m49s)

[test that we wanted to write. Thank you](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m51s)

[JC. I appreciate it. I am now old. Uh](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m53s)

[let's see here.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m57s)

[I want](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h13m59s)

[that. And this now just works. 40. Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m01s)

[not quite. You're you're you're a couple](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m07s)

[high. I'm not I'm not that old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m10s)

[yet.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m12s)

[Yet. Oh, it sounds so bad to say. Sounds](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m14s)

[so absolutely horrible to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m17s)

[say. Not old](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m20s)

[then. I Yeah, I will say it. It's felt](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m22s)

[weird in my day job. I keep getting](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m26s)

[surrounded by people that are younger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m28s)

[and younger than me and I'm like, "Oh,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m29s)

[when did I become the old guy in the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m32s)

[room?" Like, I'm not used to being the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m34s)

[old guy in the room. This feels](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m36s)

[wrong.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m40s)

[Uh, was there a file in here](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m43s)

[already? Oh, look at that. It had](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m46s)

[generated. Huh. Okay. So we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m54s)

[just copy this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h14m57s)

[over because for now this is going to be](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m00s)

[the public facing API surface and this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m03s)

[should now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m05s)

[pass. Bill's birthday. Thank you very](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m06s)

[much. I appreciate it. Yay. Test pass.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m10s)

[Okay. So for anybody con confused about](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m13s)

[this. So this is using um verify which](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m16s)

[is known as snapshot testing.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m20s)

[um trying to remember there's other](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m23s)

[names that snapshot testing goes by, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m25s)

[effectively anything you can stringify,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m28s)

[you can snapshot test. And so in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m30s)

[case, I am kind of stringifying it, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m32s)

[I'm just grabbing my my open API spec.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m36s)

[So you'll note there's this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m39s)

[verify.txt and this just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m41s)

[contains the working one here. So if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m43s)

[there are any changes to my open API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m47s)

[spec, this test fails. So it means that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m49s)

[if there is going to be any breaking API](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m53s)

[changes, right, because the this swagger](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h15m56s)

[doc is generated from my public facing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m00s)

[stuff. So if I add a property or I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m02s)

[delete something or I rename something,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m04s)

[this test breaks and I have to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m06s)

[explicitly go in and usually you copy](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m08s)

[the received into the verified file. But](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m12s)

[it shows you the diff and so you can](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m14s)

[very easily see the difference between](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m16s)

[received verified and go well yep that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m17s)

[changes expected copied in. So for now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m20s)

[because this isn't a shipped API I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m23s)

[just always copying it in right because](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m24s)

[right now we expect massive changes.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m27s)

[Okay. So, that much there is in. We have](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m31s)

[our first test. Huzzah. Now, we've got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m33s)

[we've got that much going. Now, what we](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m37s)

[want to do is we actually want to test](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m39s)

[our the whole the whole point of doing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m41s)

[this is so that we can actually test our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m44s)

[partner our partner API like that. Our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m46s)

[admin for the partner](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m49s)

[API. All of this just to get just to get](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m51s)

[set up and going. But I think the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m55s)

[refactor is going to be good because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m56s)

[going to have to do this again. And now](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h16m58s)

[I feel like I've got this service core](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m00s)

[testing is going to make me feel a lot](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m02s)

[better. So I I I think it'll be better,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m04s)

[right? And so I do uh a v1 because I'm](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m07s)

[not actually testing the extension](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m11s)

[methods. I'm I'm I'm functionally](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m13s)

[testing these guys. And I'm just going](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m15s)

[to copy this guy up here. Paste. And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m16s)

[then we're going to go beat them into](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m21s)

[submission. So step one fix](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m23s)

[namespace and get rid of all this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m27s)

[garbage. Okay. And so because we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m29s)

[named web application factory and](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m32s)

[program in both places that all just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m33s)

[works. Huzzah. Okay. And now we do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m35s)

[type of stuff. So uh create API key. So,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m39s)

[we are actually going to be testing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m43s)

[um well, I guess we start at the top,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m55s)

[right? So, let's uh we're going to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h17m58s)

[these in a different order and we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m01s)

[going to bring this guy up.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m03s)

[So](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m06s)

[list I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m08s)

[go](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m10s)

[partner list](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m12s)

[partners. Yeah, we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m14s)

[requires authenticated user. Right? And](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m16s)

[so this is the key thing here. Right?](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m19s)

[So by doing it like this, I am forcing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m22s)

[myself to make sure that the URLs work](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m25s)

[the way I expect. Right? I expect that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m28s)

[in order to hit the list endpoint, I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m31s)

[have to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m34s)

[this, right? If this doesn't work,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m35s)

[nothing matters. So, it's it these types](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m38s)

[of tests validate like my DI setup,](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m41s)

[right? Like admittedly, the tests that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m44s)

[failed previously were because part of](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m46s)

[my DI swapping out the real things for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m48s)

[fake things because at some point I got](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m51s)

[to put, you know, guard rails around](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m53s)

[what I'm testing versus what's real. But](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m55s)

[this now validates that. Okay, we're](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h18m58s)

[going to grab this one. Uh, we don't](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h19m00s)

[need these two list calls because those](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h19m03s)

[don't matter. Bring this one](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h19m05s)

[there's only a handful of properties on](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m27s)

[these. Uh should be equivalent](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m30s)

[to let's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h25m34s)

[consistent order of our](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m11s)

[coupons. Select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m35s)

[X.name should](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m38s)

[be equivalent to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m41s)

[uh ordered](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m44s)

[coupons select](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m46s)

[X.name. Right? So that should get me to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m49s)

[there. And then we're going to just](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m53s)

[rinse repeat this for the other ones.](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m54s)

[Right? because we only we don't expect](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m56s)

[everything to be included. We expect ids](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h26m58s)

[to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m01s)

[match now that we've got them in a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m04s)

[stable sort. And then we expect the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m06s)

[stripe coupon ID to match as well. And I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m08s)

[know there's a cleaner way to do this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m11s)

[with um](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m13s)

[uh strictly speaking, should ordered](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m18s)

[probably probably there there there's a](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m33s)

[there's a weird judgment call when it's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m36s)

[only being used as to to make](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m38s)

[assertions. But you are correct that the](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m43s)

[data being populated into it is all up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m45s)

[here. So it makes slightly more sense](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m48s)

[for them to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m50s)

[be in this](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m51s)

[area. So yeah, I would say](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m54s)

[yes. Um, okay. And then I am going to](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h27m57s)

[whack all of these guys out of here for](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m01s)

[now cuz I want to see this thing](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m03s)

[work. Um, this is](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m10s)

[wrong. I mean, it's going to work, but](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m14s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m17s)

[So that](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m28s)

[failed. Yeah. Yeah. Like I think there's](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m32s)

[a judgment call JC depending on like if](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m35s)

[the data is only used to make assertions](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m38s)

[I don't mind like I kind of equate it](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m40s)

[functionally to this but you are right](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m43s)

[that technically the ordering happens up](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m45s)

[here. Um what did I what did I](https://youtu.be/n0P0ge8YRwA?t=03h28m48s)
