[hello everyone welcome back uh tonight](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m01s)

[GNA continue on my my Rampage with a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m04s)

[little material design little velop pack](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m07s)

[and we're going to we're going to muddle](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m09s)

[our way through some stuff and see how](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m11s)

[we go so hopefully very cool stuff on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m12s)

[the way so let's dive](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m15s)

[in if I can remember how to drive oh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m19s)

[let's put me on the right I guess okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m23s)

[we're going to go here uh okay so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m25s)

[material design uh for has got it's just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m27s)

[absolutely killing it um with various](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m32s)

[PRS out there so we're going to start](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m34s)

[here uh let's do review code and suggest](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m36s)

[changes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m39s)

[so uh let's see fixes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m40s)

[3796 do I have issues wired up](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m44s)

[here GitHub](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m49s)

[issues take a look at this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m51s)

[one uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m53s)

[3796 uh okay so when the value of is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h00m57s)

[initially set to its maximum the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m01s)

[increase button is not disabled the same](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m03s)

[applies to minimum and the decrease](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m05s)

[button okay that makes some](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m07s)

[sense uh okay let's take a look then at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m10s)

[the pull](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m15s)

[request new code suggest](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m16s)

[changes okay so this is firing on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m20s)

[numeric value](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m23s)

[changed but I'm wondering if the point](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m25s)

[of these methods is to call it in two](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m27s)

[places ah yeah there we are](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m30s)

[okay interesting](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m37s)

[okay I'm wondering if these should be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m39s)

[called at the end and I only say that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m42s)

[because we're setting the text property](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m46s)

[here this is probably pretty good but I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m51s)

[kind of want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h01m55s)

[I kind of want to to do a test on this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m02s)

[uh let's see here so which one was that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m05s)

[uh this guy so let's go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m07s)

[here and then control shift e launches](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m10s)

[my visual](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m13s)

[studio for those people who are familiar](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m16s)

[with that what I have done is I've wired](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m18s)

[up my external editor and uh get Kraken](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m20s)

[is control shift e on Windows to launch](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m24s)

[and I've pointed it at De andv so and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m26s)

[then we just double click on the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m30s)

[solution because when you fire Dev EnV](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m31s)

[at a directory which is what get cracken](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m34s)

[is going to do it's just going to point](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m36s)

[at the repo route um it doesn't know](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m37s)

[which solu should](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m39s)

[open](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m41s)

[okay we don't have that many unused](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m47s)

[usings and it's just struggling to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m49s)

[restore there we go okay so let's go to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m51s)

[the UI test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m54s)

[WPF uh up down controls numeric up down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m56s)

[so I don't think we need a separate test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h02m59s)

[for decimal versus numeric since they](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m02s)

[share the same base but I am](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m04s)

[thinking let's let's see if we can do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m08s)

[this one public async](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m10s)

[task mer up down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m13s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m18s)

[tables uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m21s)

[buttons when](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m23s)

[value equals](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m27s)

[bounds uh hold on I'm doing my test name](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m31s)

[wrong disables buttons and we may end up](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m37s)

[we may Data Drive this here in a moment](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m41s)

[we'll just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m42s)

[see okay co-pilot you're freaking](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m43s)

[showoff you are a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m46s)

[showoff okay uh bound numeric up down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m50s)

[okay so that's not actually what I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m55s)

[what I actually want is something more](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m57s)

[akin to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h03m59s)

[this yeah but I don't need the bottom so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m02s)

[I just want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m05s)

[this okay uh let's see and then I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m09s)

[want uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m14s)

[see maximum equals 10 sure let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m17s)

[do minimum equals](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m22s)

[1 and then we're going to do value](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m25s)

[equals 1 right so we'll test the minimum](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m28s)

[case first we don't need any of this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m30s)

[stuff don't need any of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m33s)

[this honestly I I guess we don't even](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m41s)

[need um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m47s)

[pool uh plus button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m50s)

[enabled minus button enabled and then we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m54s)

[will just do the asserts here I think uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h04m57s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m01s)

[co-pilot plus button in let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m02s)

[SE equals plus button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m08s)

[enabled uh it should just be plus button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m11s)

[enabled uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m17s)

[false minus button enabled all right so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m20s)

[that should be the entire test because I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m23s)

[think the key thing here is it at least](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m25s)

[reading that ticket the initial state is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m27s)

[as important as the alternate](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m30s)

[one want to make sure that when](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m36s)

[we set that initial](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m39s)

[state that it actually fires so compile](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m42s)

[compile compile go go go go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m44s)

[go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m53s)

[launch okay so test test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h05m57s)

[went red I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m01s)

[think uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m07s)

[here oh the test went red because I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m09s)

[duplicated value and that is invalid](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m12s)

[saml okay that that unfortunately makes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m15s)

[some amount of sense do this guy here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m19s)

[for the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m22s)

[moment okay so test is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m24s)

[green when value equals I think we're](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m27s)

[going to go with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m30s)

[minimum uh and then I think what I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m35s)

[to do here is I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m37s)

[equals](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m41s)

[maximum kind of wonder if I just Data](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m43s)

[Drive](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m45s)

[this int](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m47s)

[value](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m49s)

[pool](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m52s)

[uh enabled](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m57s)

[pool increase enabled so there there's a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h06m59s)

[there's a method to this madness here so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m03s)

[when writing tests you generally don't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m05s)

[want to put in conditions if um as much](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m07s)

[as you can help it because conditions](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m10s)

[open you up to test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m13s)

[failures but if](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m18s)

[you uh if you find a case like this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m20s)

[where it's like I kind of want a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m22s)

[condition like there's I I I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m24s)

[basically the same stuff with a few](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m28s)

[things being](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m29s)

[different one of the ways to work around](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m31s)

[that is to Data Drive your test and make](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m33s)

[your expect so rather than conditions](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m37s)

[about because I could do you know if](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m40s)

[value equals minimum then you know set](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m42s)

[this accordingly but if instead I just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m44s)

[do direct values I end up with uh no](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m48s)

[conditions right uh assert](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m52s)

[equals uh increase](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h07m56s)

[enabled uh I'm sorry is it equal](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m02s)

[yeah been using too many different test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m07s)

[ones uh let's see decrease](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m10s)

[enabled right so there's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m14s)

[that maybe we should rename this to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m17s)

[increase button rather than plus](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m20s)

[button that seems to be a little better](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m23s)

[same with this one we'll just rename](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m25s)

[it three](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m28s)

[increase decrease there Bippity bity](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m38s)

[booah and then here what we do is we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m41s)

[just do inline data all right so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m44s)

[there](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m47s)

[there uh and actually I think what I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m49s)

[want to do is split the difference I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m52s)

[kind of want to test the the happy case](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m54s)

[here so on one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m57s)

[I expect decrease to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h08m59s)

[false on five I expect them both to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m03s)

[true and on 10 I expect the increase to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m06s)

[be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m10s)

[disabled now we can run this sucker and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m10s)

[it should just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m13s)

[work](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m16s)

[hopefully yay okay we're going to go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m23s)

[description](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m28s)

[issue and then I think what we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m31s)

[could uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m36s)

[here v](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m40s)

[head this thing in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m43s)

[here 37](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m46s)

[96 right and we'll just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m49s)

[clap uh that in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m54s)

[here right](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h09m58s)

[okay so going to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m00s)

[this adding UI](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m03s)

[test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m06s)

[and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m07s)

[push and let's just jump out to the V](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m09s)

[real quick obviously opens on the wrong](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m13s)

[screen because](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m16s)

[reasons excellent uh enable auto](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m19s)

[merge oh hey go pilot or GitHub this is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m24s)

[this is a new](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m29s)

[UI I don't hate](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m33s)

[it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m36s)

[oh just shipped very](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m37s)

[recently that's cool okay uh put that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m42s)

[one down let's go over](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m46s)

[here okay small discrepancies with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m48s)

[filled](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m51s)

[outline so let's go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m53s)

[here and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h10m56s)

[here I oh I'm double clicking when I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m03s)

[shouldn't okay there's this guy](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m07s)

[here and he needs deal with the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m12s)

[conflicts so this conflict detector is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m15s)

[kind of convenient because it can see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m17s)

[that it um that I'm about to have a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m19s)

[problem so we're going to rebase and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m22s)

[just see what the problems](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m25s)

[are there are merch conflict take a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m27s)

[look okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m31s)

[so this one has](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m35s)

[a so background on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m37s)

[master](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m45s)

[um this one has background down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m49s)

[here I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h11m53s)

[well hold up uh abort rebase let's let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m02s)

[review changes first](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m06s)

[because I I have a strange feeling that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m10s)

[numeric up down control is going to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m14s)

[part of this okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m15s)

[so the background property was moved](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m18s)

[down here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m21s)

[uh wait a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m33s)

[minute yeah your you Cod just changes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m35s)

[okay let's see this one has content grid](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m38s)

[changing the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m43s)

[opacity for enabled and has outline text](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m46s)

[field okay so I think the easiest thing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m51s)

[for this is let's run it because we've](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m54s)

[got a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m57s)

[got a page on the demo app that's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h12m59s)

[specifically around verifying that all](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m01s)

[of these fields look the same act the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m02s)

[same but I don't know it may not cover](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m05s)

[the numeric](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m08s)

[ones let's just look real](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m10s)

[quick](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m13s)

[uh the when disabled the background of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m20s)

[the FI combo box is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m23s)

[different then Auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m25s)

[so we might just need to check those](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m32s)

[okay so let's go here and we've got the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m34s)

[fields line up one and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m37s)

[remember combo box is definitely in here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m40s)

[and it is specifically](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m43s)

[around disabling of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m45s)

[Phil well the good news is that looks](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m55s)

[pretty good for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h13m58s)

[disabling we've got Auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m01s)

[here as well so that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m03s)

[seems we may jump to master to take a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m07s)

[look at the difference um this does not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m09s)

[oh it does have numeric up down okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m12s)

[don't know the background of the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m15s)

[fill effectively this row here had](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m17s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m22s)

[uh uh let's see when](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m27s)

[disabled when disabled the hints](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m30s)

[foreground the auto suggest box is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m34s)

[different okay I'm gonna just screenshot](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m37s)

[this for the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m40s)

[moment so I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m41s)

[can keep this here and then actually you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m43s)

[know what we should do we should create](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m46s)

[a work](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m49s)

[tree so let's see here uh where is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m51s)

[create work tree](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m55s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h14m58s)

[pull work tree from origin](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m02s)

[Master uh yes create work tree so the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m05s)

[idea here is a work tree is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m09s)

[a uh let's see open work](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m12s)

[tree a work tree is kind of like having](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m16s)

[a second clone of your repository the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m19s)

[difference uh so you end up with a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m22s)

[folder it's got a full copy of your](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m24s)

[source code at the given point that you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m27s)

[uh intended to be at so in that regard](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m29s)

[it is like a um a second clone the big](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m31s)

[advantage of it though is it doesn't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m35s)

[have uh a dogit folder like what you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m37s)

[would expect with a full clone because](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m40s)

[that git folder is actually a complete](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m43s)

[database of all of your commits and all](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m45s)

[of that stuff a work tree just has a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m48s)

[reference back to where the source skit](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m50s)

[folder is elsewhere so you get to save](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m52s)

[on that database](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m54s)

[size so for repositories that are quite](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m55s)

[big or have a lot of mths or similar um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h15m59s)

[it can be quite an advantage to be able](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m02s)

[to go through and do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m05s)

[it uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m07s)

[see demos let's go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m09s)

[here a startup project okay I want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m12s)

[take a look](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m15s)

[at so the one on the right is going to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m17s)

[be the the feature branch and I'll put](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m20s)

[the other one on the left here in a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m22s)

[moment](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m24s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m31s)

[interesting okay uh let's see so look at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m35s)

[the same page Fields line](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m39s)

[up doc you over here okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m41s)

[so my big head is going to be in the way](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m45s)

[regardless of what side I put it on but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m48s)

[if I disable this okay so the background](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m49s)

[color the numeric up down clearly is off](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m52s)

[the hint color of the auto suggest box](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m56s)

[is definitely off as well okay so I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h16m58s)

[agree on both of those so combo box](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m02s)

[check numeric up down the background](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m04s)

[color I think that's what we just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m07s)

[acknowledged yep numeric up down the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m08s)

[background color isn't correct Auto](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m10s)

[suggest the disabled the field is wrong](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m13s)

[there yep that now lines up better okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m19s)

[when disabled the foreground is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m23s)

[different](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m26s)

[yeah it it it is cuz you can see how](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m29s)

[it's definitely a little lighter here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m32s)

[the rest of them okay so we agree there](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m35s)

[in general the hints foreground of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m37s)

[outlined oh yep there as well see it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m42s)

[right there okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m47s)

[yep and then when disabl to clear button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m50s)

[foreground in the outline suggest](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m53s)

[box disabled uh um that's clear](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h17m56s)

[button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m05s)

[uh when disabled the clear button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m07s)

[foreground is different sorry not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m09s)

[disabled I read that wrong and also](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m11s)

[agree because that thing is definitely](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m15s)

[lighter than the than the other options](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m16s)

[Okay cool so then that means for testing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m20s)

[this we my big head to the other](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m23s)

[side and we go has clear](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m26s)

[button and visibly all of those things](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m31s)

[look pretty](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m34s)

[good all of those things look pretty](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m38s)

[good as they](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m41s)

[sit okay so we're going to close this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m42s)

[down before I get confused as to which](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m45s)

[Visual Studio is which okay but the only](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m47s)

[thing we have to deal with here is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m50s)

[dealing with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m51s)

[the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m53s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m55s)

[um go back to our](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m56s)

[our other branch which is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h18m59s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m06s)

[okay now if we go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m08s)

[here if I rebase this on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m12s)

[Master uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m17s)

[see no I don't want that master so I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m22s)

[kind of want to hide](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m26s)

[that one so it doesn't get confused on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m30s)

[it and then I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m33s)

[think people go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m37s)

[there yeah rebase](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m40s)

[onto](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m43s)

[there merge conflicts and now I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m46s)

[we've got a better picture of what this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m49s)

[ends up needing to be I think what we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m50s)

[want we want to take this side here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m54s)

[actually I think we want to take this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m58s)

[whole thing because I don't think we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h19m59s)

[want this background](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m02s)

[change here I think we want because we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m04s)

[had a similar bug where we fixed the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m08s)

[background on the border and I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m10s)

[that's what we want to keep I think we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m11s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m13s)

[test you rebase and see if that handles](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m15s)

[it okay so that that did in fact was the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m17s)

[only conflict so let's check and see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m23s)

[that it still looks](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m27s)

[correct long as it still looks proper](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m29s)

[there should be pretty](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m33s)

[good okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m38s)

[so line](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m41s)

[up okay I'm make you big again and we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m43s)

[want the clear button and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m46s)

[disabled get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m51s)

[that no](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m55s)

[bueno that no](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m57s)

[bueno okay so we actually don't want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h20m59s)

[that change we do want it down on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m02s)

[the on the text box itself okay so what](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m06s)

[we're going to do is we are going to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m10s)

[just throw ourselves back to where we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m12s)

[were reset](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m14s)

[here and then we're going to do that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m16s)

[rebase one more time then we will](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m19s)

[resolve the conflict](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m21s)

[differently so instead what we're saying](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m25s)

[is we actually like this fix](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m27s)

[here what we're going to do is I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m32s)

[just take this side](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m34s)

[wholesale and I think we take this side](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m40s)

[wholesale and then we're going to retest](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m43s)

[this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m46s)

[guy recompile since I don't trust it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m52s)

[otherwise](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h21m55s)

[reminds me I need to go back and fix](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m04s)

[that SLE test so much stuff so much to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m05s)

[do so much to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m09s)

[do no time to do at all](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m11s)

[okay be bigger is enabled clear](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m16s)

[button](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m23s)

[okay that looks pretty good](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m25s)

[I'm just going down through the list of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m32s)

[things that were mark this problems](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m34s)

[before and double-checking them](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m37s)

[again I think those are all still good](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m39s)

[so I think what we do now here is we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m43s)

[force push so when you do a rebase as](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m46s)

[you can see the previous history tree](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m48s)

[was here the new history tree is up here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m50s)

[and so when you rewrite history like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m54s)

[that it does require a force push to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h22m57s)

[effectively tell the remote host hey I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m00s)

[know your branch pointer was over here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m02s)

[but nah we're going to be up here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m04s)

[now um and then we can just bounce out](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m05s)

[to the PRS enable auto merge Auto merge](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m08s)

[and then this needs to go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m13s)

[here um we come in here and give it the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m15s)

[appr the old the old](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m18s)

[approve](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m22s)

[uh great I rebased it on on Master to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m23s)

[solve](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m30s)

[conflicts thank](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m32s)

[you that one's going to go as](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m37s)

[well yep Auto merge is set](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m40s)

[there and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m43s)

[then move that and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m48s)

[then make sure that goes in 53 and then](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m51s)

[I want to grab the bug for this one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m56s)

[make sure that goes into 53 as well this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h23m59s)

[is not an evaluation it is a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m04s)

[bug and then this guy here I want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m07s)

[make sure I get the issue moved over as](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m12s)

[well and drop the evaluation required](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m15s)

[this new UI is kind of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m17s)

[nice I think I like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m20s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m25s)

[yeah I like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m29s)

[it okay so there is all of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m32s)

[that oh good so he was testing it on the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m36s)

[exact same page I was perfect perfect](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m39s)

[perfect perfect okay so that gets us to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m42s)

[there that gets us there that gets both](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m44s)

[of those going I think the other two](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m46s)

[PRS yeah this is the one we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m51s)

[were um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h24m55s)

[new changes since I last viewed](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m01s)

[what got going on](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m04s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m08s)

[um yeah I'm trying to look at this one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m28s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m29s)

[um yeah this one gave me a lot of pause](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m34s)

[and I don't know that we want to merge](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m38s)

[that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m41s)

[okay okay that handles that that handles](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m43s)

[that next you have to promise not to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m47s)

[laugh at me okay going to try a little](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m50s)

[hand at a little bit of rust I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m55s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h25m58s)

[so so kayin conveniently got me a code](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m00s)

[review and we had a little chat on this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m04s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m07s)

[here I think I showed this last time](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m08s)

[but um the velop Pack Flow](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m11s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m15s)

[L let me in let me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m16s)

[in all right so if we go and look at one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m21s)

[of these](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m24s)

[releases which this now should all be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m26s)

[working much better but there is this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m28s)

[concept of a tiered roll out being able](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m30s)

[to say hey I want to do this release and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m32s)

[I want roughly 50% of my users to see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m34s)

[this update right that way you can](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m37s)

[monitor Telemetry metrics whatever](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m39s)

[you've got going to decide if you want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m41s)

[to you know bump it up more or similar](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m43s)

[like okay great right so I did all of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m46s)

[that but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m50s)

[then uh let's see just going to check](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m52s)

[some of these here so this guy here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m55s)

[specifically this function kayn pointed](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h26m58s)

[out that I was kind of dumb and didn't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m00s)

[actually write any tests which usually I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m04s)

[love my test but this was rust and I was](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m08s)

[feeling not confident in myself so I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m11s)

[didn't but that was wrong so we are](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m13s)

[going to correct my mistake so we're](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m16s)

[going to go here and we're going to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m19s)

[see see about finding my way through the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m21s)

[sucker because I would like to learn](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m25s)

[this now I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m28s)

[believe so locator here now Russ does](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m30s)

[have one kind of coolish](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m35s)

[thing over here that kin was showing me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m38s)

[that I that I thought was kind of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m41s)

[slick um because one of the problems](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m43s)

[that you run into in C is the idea of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m45s)

[you want to test a private](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m48s)

[function and there's lots of debates](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m50s)

[about should you even test a private](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m52s)

[function no you should always test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m54s)

[something through the public API blah](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m55s)

[blah blah right and for for good](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h27m57s)

[structure that is true however there are](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m00s)

[a number of times where it would be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m02s)

[significantly nicer to just be able to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m05s)

[test your private function in isolation](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m08s)

[right you've got a little bit of logic](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m10s)

[you know maybe it's doing some](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m12s)

[computational work it's like I just want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m13s)

[to test this by itself like yes I could](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m15s)

[test it from the public API but that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m19s)

[requires a lot more setup than what I'm](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m20s)

[actually interested in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m22s)

[covering um and so rust has something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m23s)

[that looked kind of cool and I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m28s)

[it's up here in bins](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m30s)

[Source where was it it was like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m33s)

[installer RS I think is where it was](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m36s)

[down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m39s)

[here no where was it where was it I saw](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m41s)

[it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m46s)

[somewhere it has the ability to do tests](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m47s)

[in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m50s)

[line and I don't recall](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m51s)

[where yeah that thing it lets you do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m55s)

[this kind of stuff which is weird to me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h28m59s)

[but it's also kind of cool right like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m02s)

[you can just run your](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m05s)

[tests straight up um and I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m07s)

[think yeah you can just do this and you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m14s)

[can run test so we're going to try to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m16s)

[this and I'm just going to move this off](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m18s)

[to the side for a moment while I well I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m20s)

[figure out how to set this up so the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m22s)

[function in question that we're looking](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m24s)

[to do so the way that tiered roll out](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m25s)

[works is the vpac generates a unique ID](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m28s)

[for the users and right now it's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m33s)

[literally goid new goid but it doesn't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m34s)

[really matter what it is as long as it's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m37s)

[um as long as it's hash is roughly](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m41s)

[evenly distributed which Net's hash](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m44s)

[codes are pretty good they generally](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m47s)

[spread out nice and it's like we weren't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m49s)

[real concerned about like this isn't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m51s)

[Security based or similar it's just kind](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m53s)

[of controlling uh who sees what updates](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m55s)

[when and in reality if people wanted to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h29m58s)

[cheat the system they could always just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m01s)

[genen their own IDs or even request](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m02s)

[updates without them and then the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m04s)

[problem goes away right so it's like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m06s)

[like this is just kind of a best get uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m08s)

[a best effort to try to to Stage the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m10s)

[roll out but it doesn't guard against](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m12s)

[somebody who's like I always want latest](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m13s)

[give that to me now right so this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m15s)

[function here it's purpose in life is to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m18s)

[gen a new ID uh shove it into the the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m21s)

[beta ID file](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m25s)

[um and then uh return it back right and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m28s)

[if the file already exists read the file](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m32s)

[out of it and then We're Off to the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m35s)

[Races so this is what we would like to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m38s)

[test um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m41s)

[and I don't know my rough stuff well](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m44s)

[enough so please try not to make too](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m46s)

[much fun of me um how do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m48s)

[I oh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m51s)

[sweet so I can just do that can I pull](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m53s)

[you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m56s)

[well here let's let's do this so let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h30m59s)

[go down to the bottom and let's give](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m01s)

[ourself a test first of all we're going](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m02s)

[to try this so pound test darn I'm going](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m05s)

[to learn this uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m09s)

[function uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m11s)

[test beta ID we're going to give it a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m14s)

[better name here in a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m16s)

[moment uh boom so thank you co-pilot now](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m17s)

[shut up and go away that got me to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m21s)

[there and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m24s)

[then we've got got assert equal assert](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m26s)

[bang that's kind of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m29s)

[cool uh assert not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m30s)

[equal I guess between the two of those](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m34s)

[that that pretty much covers everything](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m36s)

[of basic that you might want okay so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m38s)

[we're going to close this and then I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m41s)

[want a split window here and I want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m42s)

[turn this one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m45s)

[up because I got to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m47s)

[how to do this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m50s)

[properly right so the key thing here is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m51s)

[what we are looking to do is test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m54s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h31m58s)

[test uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m01s)

[locator and then let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m03s)

[grab what did we name the sucker](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m06s)

[uh uh should probably call it staged](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m11s)

[user ID the only reason the file is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m14s)

[called beta ID is for back compat with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m16s)

[Cloud squirrel uh stage user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m19s)

[ID for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m22s)

[new user right so we're going to go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m25s)

[there and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m28s)

[then co-pilot you want to try to write](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m30s)

[the function for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m32s)

[me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m34s)

[anything](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m36s)

[no Izzy](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m40s)

[welcome oh boy you know a lot more](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m43s)

[language W Wan Bo okay I don't even know](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m46s)

[what language that one is and now I got](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m50s)

[to Google](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m52s)

[it welcome in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m54s)

[German aha what are we up to so we just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h32m59s)

[merged a couple PRS for the material](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m02s)

[design and zaml project or at least we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m04s)

[set them to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m06s)

[autocomplete we are attempting to figure](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m09s)

[out unit testing in Rust least that's my](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m11s)

[my goal so the tiered roll out stuff](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m14s)

[that I uh showed on the velop PAC stuff](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m17s)

[last week uh the pr is ready to merge](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m20s)

[but Kaylin asked if I'd be willing to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m24s)

[try my hand at writing a unit test for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m26s)

[it and I went you know what I should](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m28s)

[learn how to write unit tests here and I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m29s)

[will say being able to have a test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m32s)

[inside of the class that you're testing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m34s)

[is like it's just it's weird but it's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m36s)

[kind of nice](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m40s)

[too](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m42s)

[so it feels](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m43s)

[goodish um so I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m47s)

[hunt](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m53s)

[this I think what we want to do is we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m55s)

[just want to create a a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h33m57s)

[locator and this is this is where I'm](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m03s)

[I'm a little I I need to understand](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m06s)

[exactly how this thing was set up](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m08s)

[because I I added my code in without a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m10s)

[lot of thoughts on how it should work](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m13s)

[the other thought that was thrown out](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m17s)

[there is maybe what we should do is we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m19s)

[should cash this value so that it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m20s)

[doesn't uh change uh or Dutch](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m23s)

[Dutch is pronounced differently it's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m31s)

[kind of a mush Mash of German French and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m33s)

[English ah good so it'll so parts of it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m35s)

[will sound familiar to me and I'll be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m38s)

[completely clueless it'll be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m40s)

[great](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m42s)

[uh I guess](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m43s)

[I to think I know somebody who who knows](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m46s)

[Dutch and I feel like maybe now that now](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m50s)

[that I say it out loud I have heard them](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m52s)

[say that before](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m55s)

[interesting okay anyway so self](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h34m58s)

[paths is going to get me in there so I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m04s)

[need to uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m06s)

[here uh create new locator with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m09s)

[uh uh path to a test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m15s)

[directory um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m24s)

[I don't feel like that is how you want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m31s)

[to get your thing and more importantly I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m34s)

[don't think that is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m36s)

[the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m40s)

[uh I don't think that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m42s)

[is it's get packages dur that I'm](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m45s)

[actually going after but what is get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m48s)

[packages dur so I actually want this to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m50s)

[be packages dur is more akin to what](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m54s)

[we're going](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m57s)

[for and then how does the defaults](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h35m58s)

[actually set](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m02s)

[up path](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m08s)

[buffer I kind of want to look at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m10s)

[where this guy oh boy v um do we have a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m14s)

[concept of a test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m21s)

[directory V com sort of a medcal way it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m24s)

[would be said V](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m28s)

[Comon I can see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m31s)

[it okay so if this gets me my packages](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m35s)

[dur where do I get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m40s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m42s)

[my trying to see if we've already got a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m44s)

[sample of like a something that does](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m47s)

[test iio](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m50s)

[somewhere uh it would probably be in the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m52s)

[bins](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m55s)

[I would think if we had something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h36m59s)

[that did test actually you know what if](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m03s)

[that's the case what I should really do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m07s)

[is find in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m09s)

[folder I should just look at the tests](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m12s)

[that are already in here and see do any](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m14s)

[of these actually write out](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m17s)

[to a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m20s)

[path see that one isn't actually writing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m23s)

[to a path](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m26s)

[it just has one of these but more](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m29s)

[importantly it kind of shows me what I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m31s)

[should be doing here um what I was](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m32s)

[looking for though is something that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m35s)

[some test where we've written out to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m38s)

[like a test directory of where](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m40s)

[is where is a safest place to write](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m43s)

[um test files to is kind of what I'm](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m49s)

[going for I don't know the right answer](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m52s)

[to that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m55s)

[Mike my default setting is to say hey](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h37m59s)

[let's go through so this is actually](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m01s)

[what we want to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m03s)

[doing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m06s)

[here kind of set our thing up so we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m09s)

[should probably do something more akin](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m12s)

[to that in our](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m14s)

[test so it should look more like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m17s)

[that actually we're going to do this but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m21s)

[we're going to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m25s)

[don't know that this is a good directory](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m29s)

[to play in](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m31s)

[though and that's what's giving me a bit](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m33s)

[of pause is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m35s)

[I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m37s)

[um I don't think we need to fully](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m39s)

[qualify um is I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m41s)

[know that's an OSX one is there a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m46s)

[Windows](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m48s)

[one known path user profile you know](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m49s)

[what maybe we do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m53s)

[because I bet](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m58s)

[you I bet](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h38m59s)

[you uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m03s)

[here I am willing to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m08s)

[bet uh I don't really want the path um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m12s)

[this guy here probably has a get temp](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m17s)

[directory or](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m19s)

[similar get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m22s)

[temp uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m25s)

[you get temp directory as](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m29s)

[string uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m34s)

[see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m36s)

[tempter directory](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h39m39s)

[okay uh let's see and then I want to go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m00s)

[here and I want to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m03s)

[this okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m08s)

[and something like that for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m12s)

[now uh let's see fail to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m15s)

[resolve similar path exists standard OS](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m20s)

[Windows uh I don't think that's actually](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m24s)

[what we want because I'm I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m27s)

[think we want to be able to reach](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m37s)

[across well and that's the thing is I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m40s)

[don't I want a crossplatform way of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m42s)

[grabbing the temp directory not a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m44s)

[Windows ZF way of grabbing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m46s)

[it and like for example here that's a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m48s)

[hardcoded path probably why it's set to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m51s)

[ignore what I want is a cross platformy](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m55s)

[way of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h40m58s)

[getting a temp directory or a working](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m00s)

[directory uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m25s)

[these are all fine and good tests but I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m28s)

[want something that actually hits a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m30s)

[directory okay test unpin](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m33s)

[shortcut and these are also fine but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m37s)

[they're also](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m39s)

[hitting things very specific to kin's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h41m44s)

[and okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m02s)

[uh when in doubt we asked the magical AI](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m06s)

[how can I get the temp](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m10s)

[directory uh on all](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m14s)

[platform pretty please co-pilot give me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m17s)

[a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m19s)

[hint oh really it's that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m23s)

[uh between processes different](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m27s)

[prison must use a secure method to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m29s)

[create a uniquely named](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m32s)

[file](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m34s)

[great um and then does the join method](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m36s)

[allow me to pass](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m39s)

[in okay so then can I just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m42s)

[do uh okay so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m46s)

[now uh how can I create a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m49s)

[random directory name](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h42m55s)

[name yeah I don't like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m00s)

[that well maybe I don't like that how do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m06s)

[I know that random string doesn't give](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m09s)

[me invalid](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m10s)

[characters oh this is alpha numeric](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m15s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m20s)

[okay okay so that'll give me alpha](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m22s)

[numeric okay okay okay okay I dig it I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m25s)

[dig it I dig](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m27s)

[it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m29s)

[um okay so that gets me to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m31s)

[there back down head back down head back](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m35s)

[down we want packages dur not root](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m38s)

[after uh packages dur and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m41s)

[then that gets me to there that gets me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m45s)

[a new](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m49s)

[locator and then what I would like to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m49s)

[call here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h43m52s)

[very kind about it but there was some of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h44m34s)

[my code that he looked at he's like I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h44m36s)

[don't know where you came up with this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h44m37s)

[idea like I'm sorry co-pilot helped and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h44m39s)

[actual is that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h45m34s)

[the that the way we do this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h45m35s)

[here uh CT not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h45m39s)

[exists](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h46m51s)

[um then verify](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h46m54s)

[yeah so I feel like I don't like getting](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m00s)

[this so let's do something like let](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m04s)

[equal](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m11s)

[that right and then we will](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m12s)

[do beta ID path](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m16s)

[exists and then we'll](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m19s)

[do this guy here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m23s)

[don't really want to use the unwrap](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m34s)

[because unwrap as I Now understand it is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m36s)

[kind of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m39s)

[because it forces evaluation and then](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m52s)

[could cause problems if say the task do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m54s)

[similar in Rust you have Panic which is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h47m57s)

[more like process die as I understand it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h48m01s)

[there's a way to do this and that's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h50m44s)

[what's bothering me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h50m46s)

[um um I guess though what we can do is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m10s)

[we can we can actually so we can get we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m14s)

[can get away with this a little bit](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m15s)

[make this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m21s)

[work um if I do this right](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m22s)

[um and I don't know if Panic is the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m29s)

[right I think what I want to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m31s)

[is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m35s)

[it to intentionally fail in that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m42s)

[case okay let's run the test and see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m45s)

[what happens](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m48s)

[because that's the other fun drawback is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h51m59s)

[I'm I'm somewhat learning my tool chain](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h52m01s)

[as we go as](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h52m03s)

[well](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h52m08s)

[of user file and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h52m55s)

[then I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h52m58s)

[it's is the oh it's the format thing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m00s)

[this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m10s)

[becomes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m12s)

[that uh let's see here what are you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m23s)

[unhappy about](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m25s)

[format must be a string](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h53m28s)

[fix okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h55m14s)

[you need to change the format macro to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h55m30s)

[use a string literal](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h55m32s)

[uh the power of the formatting string is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h55m57s)

[is there a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=00h58m46s)

[okay so if I do let's see here Step St](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h00m58s)

[right and then I want to see beta ID](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m02s)

[path I want to go look where this guy](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m05s)

[is is known](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m14s)

[file](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m21s)

[uh how do I look at your](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m23s)

[values okay I know C spoils me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m29s)

[but don't I mean I could view the binary](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m37s)

[data but that it seems like a heck of a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m40s)

[lot of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m42s)

[work there we go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m47s)

[copy value that's what I want is I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h01m57s)

[that value only oh dear Heavens not that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m01s)

[value sorry it copied with all of the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m04s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m08s)

[so I do know it's under Local app data](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m09s)

[and so that we can get myself into here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m13s)

[and then we can go down into velop](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m17s)

[oh oh it didn't write any](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m38s)

[oh okay okay let's stop and redbug this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m42s)

[okay I think this fails because I think](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m48s)

[if I don't create the directory](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m53s)

[this thing is actually hitting the the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h02m57s)

[warning that's my](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m01s)

[theory is that we are actually hitting](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m05s)

[the warning so that doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m07s)

[creates a new ID goes to right to the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m08s)

[path warning couldn't write](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m12s)

[out right then Returns the new](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m15s)

[string okay okay that's what's happening](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m20s)

[okay so if you don't make the directory](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m23s)

[it no worky got it got it got it got it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m25s)

[got it got it okay so now what we need](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m28s)

[to do here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m31s)

[is uh ensure directory exists or](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m33s)

[whatever the equivalent is uh sure](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m36s)

[the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m41s)

[packages uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m43s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m45s)

[exists uh let's see and this returns me](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m51s)

[a result I should be able to do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m53s)

[assert like that and then I don't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h03m57s)

[need right do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m03s)

[that that should get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m06s)

[me a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m08s)

[directory which then I assume it can](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m11s)

[write the beta ID that's the theory okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m13s)

[so now if I step in yep y ding ding ding](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m16s)

[ding](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m20s)

[ding generated new ID great great great](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m22s)

[back out stage user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m27s)

[ID you are a pain in the butt to look at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m29s)

[in an](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m33s)

[inspector but that looks like a Goa to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m35s)

[me with I don't understand why there's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m38s)

[random characters at the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m40s)

[end but I cannot eliminate that being](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m42s)

[a it's got a length of 36 so it it's not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m45s)

[grabbing all those characters must just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m49s)

[be showing me a section of memory okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m51s)

[so that goes there path exists great](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m54s)

[reads the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h04m58s)

[string uh let's see beta ID](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m02s)

[path I guess then the question](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m05s)

[is I go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m09s)

[here it wrote the beta](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m14s)

[ID but where did it write it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m19s)

[to yeah so there's one](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m23s)

[the path if we look at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m43s)

[it uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m46s)

[see nope](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h05m49s)

[that is a lot of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m03s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m12s)

[um I think I almost like the idea of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m20s)

[just leveraging this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m25s)

[guy rather than relying on get packages](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m28s)

[dur](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m31s)

[here and that is exactly](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m37s)

[what this code here is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m41s)

[doing oh wait no it's not no it's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m49s)

[not no it's not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m52s)

[there's a small but important](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h06m57s)

[perhaps uh let's see panicked at](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h07m46s)

[580 is here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h07m50s)

[again um and I'm not confident that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h07m52s)

[this is actually giving me what I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h07m56s)

[expect uh let's go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m10s)

[here packages dur equals](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m13s)

[then packages dir Join Beta ID p](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m20s)

[path should be the same thing B ID path](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m26s)

[because that's a path buffer then we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m29s)

[come down here and we do the same read](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m32s)

[working](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m37s)

[properly all](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h08m44s)

[step uh beta ID](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m01s)

[path really do not like the debugging](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m06s)

[experience that I am getting from this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m09s)

[might have to go try one of those other](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m12s)

[ones okay but the important thing here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m15s)

[is that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m21s)

[looks kind of like something I would](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m24s)

[expect and the assert passes for](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m27s)

[that me I would expect read to string to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m36s)

[do something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h09m40s)

[how uh does this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m15s)

[write uh new ID as a UTF f8](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m19s)

[ring oh that's UTF](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m26s)

[determine what it does if you want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m35s)

[write new ideas a UTF string you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m37s)

[maybe that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h12m58s)

[doesn't maybe this thing didn't work the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m01s)

[way I thought it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m03s)

[did thought I had gotten it working but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m05s)

[maybe I'm an](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m09s)

[idiot uh let's see here so how do you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m11s)

[write a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m14s)

[shortcuts looks like an iterator of some](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m46s)

[kind get shortcut file name](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m49s)

[yeah this this is like the pattern](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m55s)

[matchy](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h13m57s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m00s)

[um I guess that part may not be that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m08s)

[that far](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m11s)

[off yeah okay Coop pilot menu we'll come](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m14s)

[like uh remove file remove](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m31s)

[dur oh look at that create dur](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m38s)

[all that looks like a much cleaner way](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m44s)

[this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m50s)

[that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h14m55s)

[okay and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h15m02s)

[then so I guess if I do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h15m12s)

[this um I should be able to look and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h15m17s)

[string I'm wondering if this will](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h16m45s)

[actually get me what I'm looking](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h16m48s)

[for okay so we have killed off all our](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h16m52s)

[beta IDs the only one that's going to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h16m56s)

[here is going to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h16m58s)

[our good](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m00s)

[one that's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m04s)

[okay we make](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m08s)

[progress that is this one uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m10s)

[edit there we go okay so we weren't to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m15s)

[stringing the ID so that caused Great](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m18s)

[pain and suffering Okay so](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m21s)

[now that we fixed](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m25s)

[that there was a bug in the code see I I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m27s)

[must have messed that up when I switch](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m31s)

[to this uu ID thingy mobber okay uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m33s)

[let's do another test and let's test the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m38s)

[existing user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m40s)

[case](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m42s)

[um we'll deal with clean up here in a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m48s)

[moment because we probably should clean](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m50s)

[up](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m52s)

[this stuff but I don't I don't know how](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m55s)

[to properly do cleanup inside of this um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h17m57s)

[so for now we just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m02s)

[won't okay uh let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m04s)

[for disting user we're going to do the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m11s)

[same](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m14s)

[thing we're going to do this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m15s)

[maneuver and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m20s)

[then I think what I want to do is I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m22s)

[to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m26s)

[just I think I just want to straight](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m29s)

[right out to the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m32s)

[file because it doesn't the the key](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m34s)

[thing here is this doesn't have to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m37s)

[be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m40s)

[um anything fancy so uh let's see this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m43s)

[can literally just be test user ID does](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m49s)

[not matter what it is so if we just](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m53s)

[do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m57s)

[test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h18m58s)

[user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m00s)

[or stage user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m03s)

[ID right we'll do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m07s)

[that uh we don't have the beta ID path](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m10s)

[so we need to bring this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m13s)

[up right and then we're going to write](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m16s)

[it and then we want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m21s)

[actually](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m25s)

[request uh how about](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m27s)

[fected fected user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m31s)

[ID right so we're going to go here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m33s)

[affected user](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m37s)

[ID uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m39s)

[see local variable similar name exists](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m44s)

[yeah yeah yeah hush hush we'll deal with](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m46s)

[that in a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m48s)

[second](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m49s)

[um D user ID a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m51s)

[insert](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m55s)

[equal expected I I assume these are](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h19m58s)

[expected actual I I'm guessing doesn't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m00s)

[really matter um and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m04s)

[then I guess we don't need to check the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m10s)

[file because we already asserted on it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m12s)

[so that should go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m27s)

[there right and so that should](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m28s)

[be checking it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m32s)

[here yeah so run](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m35s)

[test one test pass Okay cool so we got](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m39s)

[both of those](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m44s)

[in and now the question is how do I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m46s)

[clean](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m50s)

[up uh open chat uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m51s)

[how do](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m55s)

[I yeah](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h20m57s)

[uh let's see explain how can](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m02s)

[I delete a folder at the end of a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m08s)

[test regardless of test pass or fail](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m15s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m26s)

[uh uh let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m29s)

[see gu you can use R drop trait to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m37s)

[create a custom cleanup struct stru will](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m40s)

[delete the folder when it goes out of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m43s)

[scope here you can](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m45s)

[modify](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m48s)

[oh T to include this clean](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m52s)

[up so let's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m57s)

[see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h21m59s)

[uh that does](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m04s)

[that how does it how do it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m08s)

[know missing something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m13s)

[obvious close this for a minute make you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m16s)

[I want to make you wider why can I not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m19s)

[make you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m21s)

[wider um](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m22s)

[got it so I think what we do here is we](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m32s)

[do something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m34s)

[like uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m35s)

[mod](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m39s)

[s right because I don't think I want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m43s)

[this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m45s)

[outside of it I think that goes like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m46s)

[that um and then I need](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m53s)

[to fully](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m56s)

[qualify that to be able to reference](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h22m59s)

[it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m03s)

[right and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m05s)

[then I need effectively the same thing](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m07s)

[as what was up](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m10s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m12s)

[um well we can do the auto include right](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m16s)

[so I need util as well Port crate util](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m19s)

[um I need](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m26s)

[locator then I need](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m33s)

[manifest that gets all of those going](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m38s)

[right unused Imports](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h23m44s)

[this is let's see](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m07s)

[War I don't think it's as unused as you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m12s)

[think it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m15s)

[is because I think what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m21s)

[something like this yeah see it is used](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m24s)

[uh and then this guy can go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m29s)

[here right and then this goes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m35s)

[here and then we come down](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m41s)

[here and we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m45s)

[akin to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m48s)

[this um we're going to pull you out](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m50s)

[and do something like uh let T dur](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m55s)

[equals I guess I should name](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h24m59s)

[this got to do the the rusty thing make](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m02s)

[it named](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m06s)

[properly uh tester goes like that and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m07s)

[then we do something like](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m12s)

[this um and then this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m18s)

[gets uh eser](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m22s)

[clone right and then when this guy goes](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m26s)

[out of scope it cleans it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m28s)

[up everybody gets to be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m30s)

[happy don't need that this there then](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m35s)

[you](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m39s)

[get](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m41s)

[tester then what I want to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m44s)

[see uh let's see here so there's that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m51s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m54s)

[that Implement drop for test](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m56s)

[cleanup never](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h25m59s)

[constructed is it is it right there](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m05s)

[yeah okay so now if I run this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m10s)

[test right and I probably should go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m14s)

[through and blow](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m17s)

[away](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m19s)

[these okay so those ones are gone now if](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m22s)

[I run all the tests in the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m26s)

[module both tests](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m28s)

[pass no new](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m30s)

[folders](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m33s)

[okay I don't know what the right naming](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m41s)

[scheme is for we have mod mod used](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m43s)

[elsewhere what is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m47s)

[the loging apply so underscore base](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m50s)

[probably where it goes okay so something](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m55s)

[akin to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m57s)

[that okay well](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h26m59s)

[that then let's just make sure that are](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m08s)

[there any other code pads we can't](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m11s)

[really simulate the failure case here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m14s)

[but](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m18s)

[okay in bug with writing out the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m20s)

[ID uh](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m25s)

[attempting right](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m29s)

[rust](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m31s)

[right boo yeah that gets us there that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m33s)

[gets us there oh bu doesn't do anything](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m37s)

[push okay and then kayin can go review](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m41s)

[my rust code and tell me everything that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m44s)

[I did](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m46s)

[wrong](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m47s)

[but yeah the the whole idea of traits](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m50s)

[and rust is is is is both cool and weird](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m52s)

[like they're a weird mix of like C](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h27m57s)

[default interface](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m00s)

[members kinda is sort of not](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m03s)

[really but you can mix and match them](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m07s)

[like attributes type thing so but this](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m10s)

[is kind of cool being able to abuse](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m14s)

[effectively everything is I don't want](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m17s)

[to say disposable but everything is](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m19s)

[deterministic cleaned up and so being](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m21s)

[able to](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m24s)

[abuse](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m26s)

[that is kind of](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m28s)

[a a slick little thing of create a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m31s)

[cleanup and then go through and do that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m35s)

[okay so that's good that's](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m38s)

[done that's done like it I like it I](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m43s)

[like it I like it I like it I like it](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m47s)

[okay so we send that send that send that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m49s)

[send that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m52s)

[and I think let that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m54s)

[go um double check my own](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h28m58s)

[code what we did](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m02s)

[here](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m06s)

[then did a rename](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m08s)

[here I renamed the option I left](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m12s)

[the Kaylin's feedback here was it was a](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m16s)

[little wory so we we shortened up the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m18s)

[option name but I left the property the](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m20s)

[same because it felt more](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m23s)

[exact uh let's see what was the change](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m26s)

[in here formatting formatting formatting](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m28s)

[formatting](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m31s)

[formatting that should all be](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m33s)

[fine okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m37s)

[so we're going to request re-review from](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m39s)

[kin and then this will](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m42s)

[go](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m44s)

[and we could resolve that conversation](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m46s)

[resolve that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m49s)

[conversation and then](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m51s)

[yeah we will we will await the feedback](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h29m55s)

[there okay](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h30m00s)

[cool well that gets this all up and](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h30m02s)

[rolling that gets that](https://youtu.be/cvsvs7A5AnE?t=01h30m05s)
