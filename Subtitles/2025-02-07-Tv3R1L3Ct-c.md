[it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h01m51s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h01m52s)

[boom Okay so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h01m55s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m06s)

[ah this is a good one okay so something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m08s)

[worth noting on this one uh inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m12s)

[WPF there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m14s)

[is and I guess it's true in several UI](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m16s)

[applications but what often happens is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m20s)

[you have a UI thread that is sitting in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m22s)

[a loop right it's responsible for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m24s)

[handling things and so when you want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m27s)

[change the UI or add elements uh what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m29s)

[often happens is an element is marked as](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m32s)

[invalid uh or needs measure or similar](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m35s)

[and there are multiple passes uh and the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m38s)

[idea here is that there's a first pass](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m41s)

[which is uh effectively a measure figure](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m44s)

[out how you are and then there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m46s)

[layout pass or in this a range right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m48s)

[where it's uh now that I've measured how](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m50s)

[big all of my stuff needs to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m52s)

[especially in relation to each other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m54s)

[right now I'm going to lay them out and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m56s)

[set them at that size which is effective](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h02m57s)

[L where this is landing and I am](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m00s)

[confused as to where this line even came](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m03s)

[from right because this guy here and let](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m06s)

[me make this a little](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m09s)

[bigger right so inside so this is inside](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m10s)

[of the badge control and the as as part](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m13s)

[of the badge control there is a badge](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m16s)

[container uh and up here we can see that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m17s)

[a badge container is any arbitrary UI](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m21s)

[element right great um it's the thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m25s)

[that the badge gets associated too and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m27s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m31s)

[here me look at the blame on this guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m33s)

[because I am curious where I I'm willing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m36s)

[to bet that that that came in like with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m39s)

[a a bad merge or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h03m41s)

[as things kind of started moving and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h05m39s)

[diverging we broke that because it was a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h05m41s)

[bigger dependency for not a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h05m44s)

[release very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m23s)

[shortly and we'll chest and see if my uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m24s)

[pipeline actually Works uh let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m28s)

[see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m33s)

[uh add radio button](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m36s)

[and checkbox custom foreground I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m39s)

[these last two are ones that we've](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m42s)

[looked at before and I don't know that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m44s)

[they are ones I was going to take this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m46s)

[is the draft one that's still sitting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m49s)

[there um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h10m52s)

[yeah this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m02s)

[one this one I'm a little yeah this one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m08s)

[I'm hesitant on I'm we may end up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m11s)

[rejecting okay so oh actually that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m15s)

[the so the the thing that I wanted to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m19s)

[look at is on the closed PR from last](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m22s)

[week](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m25s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m27s)

[think it was this one that we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m35s)

[did](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m41s)

[nope](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m44s)

[uh yeah this is the one so this is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m49s)

[one that we were working on last week](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m52s)

[around the the numeric up down stuff and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m54s)

[specifically](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m57s)

[the because we went through and handled](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h11m59s)

[um these couple cases but then Corvin](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m02s)

[and Nikolai both kind of threw in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m06s)

[on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m09s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m12s)

[yeah uh oh look at this and even a a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m16s)

[branch and everything perfect perfect](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m19s)

[perfect because I recommended I'm like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m21s)

[okay I clearly I'm not understanding](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m22s)

[something about this and so part of me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m24s)

[asking for a a branch or a UI test was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m27s)

[as a way of making sure I actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m31s)

[understand the problem because that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m32s)

[one of the hardest things in programming](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m34s)

[if you ever want to feel dumb pair](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m36s)

[program with somebody but you're not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m39s)

[allowed to touch the keyboard or the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m41s)

[mouse right you have to verbally](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m43s)

[communicate technical things and get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m45s)

[stuff to happen quickly it is remarkably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m48s)

[difficult to communicate about code um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m51s)

[it takes a lot of effort here so uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m54s)

[let's see there's a problem where the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m58s)

[value of numeric up down control can go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h12m59s)

[out of sync with the bound property in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m01s)

[the view](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m02s)

[model and something I want to look at is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m04s)

[I'm not 100% convinced that those two](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m06s)

[being out of sync](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m09s)

[is the value property being out of sync](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m10s)

[I think is problematic but the text](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m13s)

[being out of sync I think is desirable](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m15s)

[so I'll word it that way I the numeric](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m18s)

[control doesn't have a text property but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m20s)

[internally there is a a text box and I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m21s)

[am okay with those ones happening](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m24s)

[because the binding itself is what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m27s)

[controls when the update should occur](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m29s)

[right a binding with an update Source](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m32s)

[trigger typically occurs on Lost Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m34s)

[right if you want it to occur on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m37s)

[property changed you should set the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m39s)

[update Source property to property](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m41s)

[change so that it occurs then the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m43s)

[control I don't believe should change](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m45s)

[that right it should be in control of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m49s)

[the app author to decide where when they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m51s)

[want that to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m54s)

[occur um but let's go through this and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m55s)

[make sure that I'm on here so set the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h13m58s)

[maximum of the up down control to any](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m01s)

[type set the value equal to the maximum](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m03s)

[enter a new value greater than the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m05s)

[maximum ah I think I see the problem](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m11s)

[here so you type in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m13s)

[555 move](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m15s)

[focus and the view model gets the wrong](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m18s)

[one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m23s)

[uh test is crashing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m26s)

[okay oh this is just this is just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m32s)

[beautiful Corvin is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m34s)

[awesome okay so I need Corvin fix](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m37s)

[numeric up down I think I already have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m40s)

[the remote added so exit review okay so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m42s)

[step one we need to start hiding some](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m45s)

[remotes because I got too many remotes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m47s)

[showing up here at the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m50s)

[moment there okay there's the Corvin](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m53s)

[ones and I need set master](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h14m56s)

[up let's see Fix Auto](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m00s)

[suggest what's the branch name](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m04s)

[again fix numeric up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m07s)

[down uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m11s)

[fix or to Max this one this is the one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m20s)

[like it's got to be a recent one okay so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m24s)

[here's this let's take](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m26s)

[so let's see so set up an up down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m44s)

[control set up a view model bound the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m46s)

[sucker up everything looks](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h15m49s)

[it and you UI test for anyone confused](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m05s)

[this UI test thing is based on a library](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m09s)

[I wrote called zaml test zaml test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m12s)

[purpose in life is to test uh material](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m15s)

[design and zaml that is its purpose in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m18s)

[life um some people I found out for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m20s)

[in and playing around with uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m34s)

[potentially fixing one of my mistakes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m37s)

[from last time so that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m38s)

[exciting uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m41s)

[here this guy here so simple](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m43s)

[guy I'm curious](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m49s)

[why why is the community toolkit not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m54s)

[running on this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h16m56s)

[o rebuild our API from NET Framework 46](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m01s)

[to net 8 O that is wonderful](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m04s)

[um that there is I assume part of that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m08s)

[is revving up to latest](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m13s)

[inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m18s)

[there uh trying to figure out how to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m19s)

[import Excel and some files in a web app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m23s)

[oh I should](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m25s)

[was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m30s)

[it ping me again next week on it there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m33s)

[is a there was a library a colleague was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m37s)

[telling me about just the other day that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m39s)

[works really well for office](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m41s)

[files um because when dealing with like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m46s)

[Excel and whatnot right you can't you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m49s)

[can't leverage libraries that require um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m51s)

[interupt with the um the actual office](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m54s)

[dlls because you aren't going to have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h17m57s)

[office installed on your web server](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m00s)

[typically um I know some people who](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m02s)

[do but there was there was another](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m05s)

[library that they were using and they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m08s)

[were singing its praises and I I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m09s)

[trying to remember what it was it was I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m11s)

[I filed the name away in my head and was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m13s)

[like I shouldn't forget this and then I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m15s)

[forgot it but clearly that filing needs](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m16s)

[work um because there's there's multiple](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m20s)

[projects I've worked on where we've had](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m23s)

[to deal with uh office files U effect ly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m25s)

[in a say a Linux environment or in a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m29s)

[container or similar and this one was an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m30s)

[all managed library and I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m33s)

[remember which one it was CU there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m35s)

[lot of kind of meh libraries out there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m36s)

[for dealing with Excel and similar but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m39s)

[there's some there is some there is at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m42s)

[least one out there that a colleague](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m44s)

[thinks yeah like we have a desktop app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m47s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m50s)

[yeah yeah and desktop makes it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m53s)

[significantly easier if you can assume](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m56s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h18m58s)

[yeah uh no it's not nopi because nopi](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m00s)

[was great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m04s)

[but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m06s)

[um it like nopi is wonderful if you want](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m08s)

[to do office at the XML](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m12s)

[level](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m16s)

[like it is it is great but it's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m17s)

[low level for what uh for what it needs](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m21s)

[to do any Excel I don't know that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m24s)

[one this one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m27s)

[Ben it was Grant who was telling me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m34s)

[about it and I I cannot remember what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m35s)

[name he](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m38s)

[said](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m40s)

[um proc Net's processing Excel tool](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m46s)

[interesting this one I haven't come](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m50s)

[across before that's going on my star](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m52s)

[list](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h19m55s)

[ooh yeah at present most popular yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m00s)

[this is another thing to watch out for a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m03s)

[lot of libraries try to load everything](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m04s)

[into memory this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m06s)

[bad especially for a web based thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m09s)

[because you can get just hammered um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m12s)

[yeah yeah I'm going to import those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m17s)

[files in a web application yeah so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m19s)

[depending on what you need to do with it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m21s)

[there are like when you switch from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m24s)

[desktop to web one of the key change](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m26s)

[that has to occur is switching to kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m29s)

[of a request response setup um and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m31s)

[background processing like in a desktop](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m35s)

[app is is a lot easier than it is in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m37s)

[web because if you just do the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m39s)

[processing on import um you've now got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m41s)

[this really long running request which](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m44s)

[kind of sucks a much better structure um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m46s)

[is kind of a queuing model where on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m50s)

[import the item gets put into a queue](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m53s)

[and something else on the background](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m55s)

[processes it and then updates dates and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m57s)

[then the caller checks for when that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h20m59s)

[thing's done some sort of Separation](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m00s)

[like there's some things that are just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m03s)

[harder to do and I'm lost](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m05s)

[um okay promise not to steal all my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m10s)

[secrets okay here we go um for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m13s)

[example so this is the velop PAC library](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m21s)

[and one of the things that it has to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m25s)

[is deal with um people uploading](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m27s)

[releases so velop Pac crossplatform](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m29s)

[installer and updator framework I'm a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m32s)

[Founder so I'm biased it's the best um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m34s)

[but as part of that people have to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m38s)

[upload their their release packages](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m40s)

[right so not I I think fairly akin to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m42s)

[what what you're talking about doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m45s)

[right so on the release upload and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m47s)

[there's some some middleware to do like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m50s)

[the validation and security and all that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m51s)

[kind of stuff but what it ends up doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m53s)

[is it takes the the upload](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m56s)

[um with the upload request streams it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h21m59s)

[into](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m02s)

[a believe it's here streams it into a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m03s)

[storage](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m06s)

[account and then cues up an item on a on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m07s)

[a queue where there is a background](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m12s)

[worker watching those queue to process](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m14s)

[the files that way uh when the files](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m16s)

[come up because these are installers and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m20s)

[so an installer can be kind of big](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m22s)

[because apps can be kind of big like a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m24s)

[gig two gigs three gigs](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m26s)

[like yuck like hopefully your Excel](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m29s)

[files aren't that big um but it throws](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m31s)

[it onto a que and then the processor](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m34s)

[goes through pulls it off the queue and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m35s)

[then rips through um processing it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m37s)

[kind of effectively how it is done but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m41s)

[that does mean that the client then has](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m43s)

[to effectively in my case ping the API](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m46s)

[to say is it done yet is it done yet is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m49s)

[it done yet ah it's done now right like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m52s)

[so there's there's a little bit of that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m54s)

[whereas in a desktop app we would just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m56s)

[do like task run and start the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h22m59s)

[processing right background processing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m01s)

[is cheap because we don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m03s)

[about network connections and holding](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m05s)

[things open and that kind of thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m06s)

[so yeah uh and have to bind the Excel](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m10s)

[register to the files I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m15s)

[uploading yeah I that is one of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m18s)

[things when you go from desktop to web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m21s)

[that is that is somewhat hard because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m23s)

[there are certain things that are just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m25s)

[harder and web like I I work on video](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m27s)

[processing tools and that that is one of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m31s)

[the things where it's like everybody's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m33s)

[like oh we want it in the web it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m34s)

[location of data matters right if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m37s)

[somebody has a big video file locally on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m39s)

[on their computer it's much easier for a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m42s)

[desktop app to process it than it is for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m44s)

[a web app because the web app needs that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m46s)

[file it needs to be able to read through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m49s)

[that file and access and do stuff and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m51s)

[yeah there's cheater things you can do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m54s)

[with like in the browser local access](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m56s)

[and that kind kind think but it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m58s)

[it's not moment you want to start](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h23m59s)

[pushing it up and moving it around like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m00s)

[you have to move that data around and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m02s)

[it's not it's not trivial data streams](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m04s)

[when we start talking about big stuff is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m08s)

[hard like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m12s)

[this let's see start upload spreadsheet](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m14s)

[and files read spreadsheet extract](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m17s)

[records if there are more records show](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m19s)

[summary end yes get file name file](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m22s)

[exists uh update record](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m26s)

[path uh next record and then Loops back](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m29s)

[through okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m33s)

[so what is your client also web or is it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m38s)

[a thick client I guess it doesn't matter](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m41s)

[that much right because at the end of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m43s)

[the day if they upload the spreadsheet](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m45s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m47s)

[files it's this and files that gives me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m48s)

[a bit of pause because I'm guessing what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m51s)

[what is implied here is there's records](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m52s)

[in the spreadsheet that reference the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m54s)

[files or similar like I could see a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m55s)

[desktop client right now but it's going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h24m58s)

[to be web that's why got it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m01s)

[okay so they upload the files and and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m05s)

[honestly multifile uploads adds an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m08s)

[interesting problem because like in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m10s)

[case of vop pack I I effectively have a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m13s)

[state machine like this upload](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m16s)

[box is a a flow diagram for me um on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m18s)

[upload because I've effectively got know](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m23s)

[the group of five starts the upload](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m27s)

[they're being uploaded the the file](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m29s)

[group is marked as closed and ready for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m31s)

[processing so there's like three stages](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m33s)

[for my for this box before I go into the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m37s)

[the reading box](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m40s)

[um yeah they upload the Excel file with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m42s)

[the file](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m45s)

[path yeah um I assume ASP net core on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m46s)

[the back end are you doing minimal apis](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m51s)

[or like uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m53s)

[controllers yeah cuz I this this thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h25m57s)

[here I would I would potentially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m00s)

[controllers okay um I think some of what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m02s)

[I have is going to be potentially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m07s)

[similar I because I I did minimal API so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m09s)

[it gets a little bit different um but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m12s)

[with the controllers you can still do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m16s)

[the uh I form file on your controller](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m18s)

[method um to be able to ingest it this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m22s)

[expects uh let's see if I remember right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m25s)

[a mind type of multi-part file so if you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m28s)

[if you have like a web front end with a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m33s)

[form uh and a file input uh field that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m35s)

[what will get sent](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m39s)

[through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m41s)

[uh this is these things here um kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m42s)

[ignore because these are all me cheating](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m46s)

[with middleware to populate the rest of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m48s)

[the data right this is for you on a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m50s)

[controller these would be Constructor](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m53s)

[parameters uh for me they are parameter](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m55s)

[on a static method because that's how I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m58s)

[get them in on a minimal](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h26m59s)

[API but I think the key thing I would](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m01s)

[suggest](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m04s)

[is breaking up this flow right right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m07s)

[here right around the the top of this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m10s)

[because I think you are going to want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m13s)

[have something to separate the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m15s)

[upload bit from the the do work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m18s)

[bit right because you're going to need](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m23s)

[to you're going to need to upload the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m26s)

[file FES and then more importantly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m27s)

[you're going to have to put these](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m29s)

[somewhere right to be able to go through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m31s)

[and and process them](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m33s)

[and you also have to concern uh let me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m36s)

[screenshot this no problem um yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m40s)

[because I like I said the way the way I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m43s)

[handled it on mine is my upload step is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m45s)

[kind of broken into three parts where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m48s)

[there's the I'm the the client does okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m50s)

[I'm starting to upload multiple](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m54s)

[files then there's the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m56s)

[I'm uploading files and then there's I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h27m58s)

[done uploading files and so that kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m01s)

[just locks my unit of work in that unit](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m04s)

[of work which I we call it a release](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m07s)

[group inside of elpac but that's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m09s)

[implementation detail once that unit of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m11s)

[uh work is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m14s)

[done uh it goes through and then starts](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m16s)

[processing and once you upload you you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m20s)

[have to put the data somewhere like in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m23s)

[my case it's a storage account as a blob](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m25s)

[but it could go anywhere right uh temp](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m27s)

[folder on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m31s)

[machine get the file upload to a temp](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m33s)

[folder on the machine and we extract the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m36s)

[data](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m40s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m42s)

[that yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m45s)

[so after that we upload the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m47s)

[files interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m51s)

[okay make sure I got this right uh right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m54s)

[now we get file upload to attemp folder](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h28m57s)

[on attemp folder in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m00s)

[machine I assume when you say attemp](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m02s)

[folder in the machine that is on the web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m04s)

[server I think that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m07s)

[correct um then we extract the data](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m10s)

[after that we upload the files and in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m13s)

[the Excel it has a column named BL and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m15s)

[that that has the file names okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m19s)

[great match that column and then I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m24s)

[assume it's from that that column name](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m26s)

[go grab the file and that's where where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m28s)

[we get this this bit of logic down here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m31s)

[right so when we're when we're ripping](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m34s)

[through we're reading that column name](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m37s)

[and then if if the file exists great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m40s)

[they uploaded a matching file great we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m43s)

[update the record path if not show air](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m45s)

[message and this is another area where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m47s)

[things may not play](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m49s)

[well in inside of this right because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m52s)

[this this whole section down here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m54s)

[kind of a like this is really a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h29m57s)

[processing thing and like in a desktop](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m01s)

[app Show air Message is easy right you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m03s)

[pop up an air message but in a web app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m06s)

[you have to get that air Message all the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m10s)

[way back to the front-end client which](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m11s)

[potentially means you know failing the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m15s)

[request or having a Json payload that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m17s)

[goes back from the server to the web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m19s)

[front end that has the air Message](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m20s)

[inside of it that that's where things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m23s)

[start to get wonky and especially if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m25s)

[you're doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m27s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m28s)

[um like so uploading to the server and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m30s)

[putting in attemp directory gives me a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m34s)

[bit of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m35s)

[pause and it depends on your app right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m37s)

[and like if you control the users and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m40s)

[you control the server this may not be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m43s)

[that bad right depending on what it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m45s)

[if this were something public facing I'd](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m48s)

[be going yay yayay that sounds](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m49s)

[terrifying um because somebody could](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m51s)

[always upload too big of a file right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m54s)

[and there there are controls in ASP net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m56s)

[to to limit bite sizes of your uploads](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h30m58s)

[that's that's fine you can keep it from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m00s)

[getting too](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m01s)

[big but putting it up there and then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m03s)

[going and acting on it like this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m06s)

[where it it starts to get weird because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m09s)

[the your your web server that's supposed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m12s)

[to be handling those request response is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m15s)

[now spending time doing all of this and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m17s)

[processing that data and and there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m20s)

[question to be had here right like if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m23s)

[this entire box doesn't take that long](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m25s)

[to do it may not be a big deal right if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m27s)

[processing time is cheap and doing all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m30s)

[of this work is usually really fast fine](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m33s)

[do it on the upload not a big deal up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m36s)

[Izzy uh just reviewing something from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m39s)

[Fury real quick um so if you're doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m41s)

[this processing and it's fast doing it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m43s)

[as part of your controller method that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m47s)

[takes the upload is not technically that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m48s)

[bad right like you can get away with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m51s)

[this that's not bad but the moment](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m53s)

[processing starts to take a while or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m56s)

[files get big or things get arbitrary or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h31m57s)

[it's public facing or any of those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m00s)

[things you start to run into weird stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m01s)

[right like if this is an internal](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m04s)

[company application you control the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m06s)

[users right the more assumptions you can](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m07s)

[make about the domain the easier](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m10s)

[problems get the fewer assumptions you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m13s)

[can make about the domain the harder the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m15s)

[problems get and so if it in those cases](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m17s)

[like revelop Pac I can make very few](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m21s)

[assumptions on the files that are coming](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m23s)

[up because they're installers that are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m25s)

[going to be effectively zipped packed uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m27s)

[apps which means they'll contain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m30s)

[anything and everything and hopefully](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m32s)

[not but potentially malicious code and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m35s)

[so I I intentionally put them in a a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m37s)

[side cue that I can then spend time](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m40s)

[processing because my processing isn't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m42s)

[going to be quick I need to go through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m44s)

[and you know validate for malware for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m46s)

[example before I let something float all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m48s)

[the way through because it's like yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m50s)

[maybe maybe we don't let that thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m52s)

[through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m53s)

[um I can make loads of a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m55s)

[let me let me clarify Izzy the more](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h32m58s)

[correct assumptions you can make the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m00s)

[easier um so yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m03s)

[so without like a lot of domain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m06s)

[knowledge of what you're going for my my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m09s)

[gut reaction would be this box becomes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m11s)

[multiple steps right of in terms of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m14s)

[uploading putting it on a temp directory](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m18s)

[2 also doesn't horizontally scale well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m21s)

[um but again it depend it depends on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m25s)

[what you're doing right if all the files](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m27s)

[are coming up as a single request and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m28s)

[it's Landing there and you you you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m31s)

[control the servers and you know that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m33s)

[dis size and things like that aren't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m34s)

[going to be a problem maybe not a big](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m35s)

[deal right especially if it's like an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m38s)

[internal company app you can probably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m40s)

[get away with it right um the moment you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m42s)

[start horizontally scaling things out](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m45s)

[where it's like oh I might want to make](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m47s)

[this thing handle more load well that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m48s)

[that's going to be a problem because if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m51s)

[you start talking file system that's now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m52s)

[locked to a single machine it does not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m55s)

[least roll um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h33m58s)

[yeah uh using your tips I got the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m02s)

[attention of the project man Etc but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m05s)

[now yeah Fury no I get it I get it well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m10s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m13s)

[that if it makes you feel better it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m15s)

[better to know sooner rather than later](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m17s)

[right like most of the time if I get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m19s)

[called in to help with a project it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m22s)

[usually like 3 months after I would have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m23s)

[liked to be involved in the project it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m26s)

[like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m27s)

[people you've you started a hole and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m28s)

[then you kept digging so it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m30s)

[like it is worth noting but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m33s)

[it's yeah it it's good it's good that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m36s)

[you acknowledge it but it's it's also](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m39s)

[worth kind of thinking through like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m42s)

[we've got one project right now that's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m44s)

[desktop app where the the client really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m45s)

[wants to move a lot of it to web which](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m48s)

[is great right like a lot of things are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m50s)

[moving to web but the the key thing that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m52s)

[we've been focused on is how how is that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m55s)

[functionality going to work in the web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h34m58s)

[right because you you have to kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m00s)

[rethink how things are expected to work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m02s)

[because now like in a desktop app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m06s)

[everything lives in the desktop app it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m08s)

[in the one process right the moment you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m10s)

[say a web-based application you've got a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m12s)

[minimum two right you've got your your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m14s)

[API process and you've got your your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m17s)

[browser process and those at minimum](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m19s)

[you're you're even if even if those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m22s)

[lived on the same machine you've got at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m24s)

[least two things now that are that are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m25s)

[working and figuring out how how that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m27s)

[communication Works adds a little bit of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m30s)

[complexity](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m33s)

[uh just need to have my data store](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m36s)

[framework sadly my old company still has](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m39s)

[not open sourced it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m41s)

[yeah um oh I'm just going to show this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m44s)

[off real quick too uh tool](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m47s)

[kit data sync so this is a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m52s)

[library this it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m56s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h35m59s)

[it yeah this is this this is the guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m01s)

[this is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m05s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m06s)

[so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m08s)

[um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m12s)

[wow oh it is this this is the avalonia](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m19s)

[Tim this is the avalonia Tim so data syn](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m23s)

[because so many people have the idea of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m27s)

[a and this is this is not meant for web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m29s)

[so Fury disregard this this is not this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m32s)

[is not for you this is it's for anybody](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m34s)

[building a desktop app but for people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m36s)

[who have to build a thick client](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m38s)

[application and deal with syncing back](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m40s)

[and forth um this is a very reasonable](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m42s)

[library for doing this please don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m46s)

[build your own sync system your or uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m48s)

[Izzy's comment with the the data store](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m50s)

[framework kind of got me thinking about](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m52s)

[this um this is intended to be that uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m54s)

[effectively store and forward based](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h36m58s)

[system right uh yeah horrible idea web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m00s)

[app using daing yeah don't do that web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m05s)

[apps kind of by definition typically](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m06s)

[work in an online Manner and the few](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m09s)

[that work in an offline manner they're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m11s)

[special stuff but this is this is your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m12s)

[thick client store and forward based](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m15s)

[style application so it uses light on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m17s)

[the client um and then comes with a set](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m19s)

[of uh controllers that you plug in on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m22s)

[the back end and then you can plug in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m24s)

[different databases is on your um API](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m26s)

[and then things go back and forth no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m31s)

[more request just ship your DB back and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m34s)

[forth yeah so but if for anybody looking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m36s)

[to do that please do not build your own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m39s)

[data sync framework please use this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m41s)

[one Adrian built it Adrian's a wonderful](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m44s)

[man and it's a pretty cool framework so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m48s)

[um yeah so if anybody has that check it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m52s)

[out okay I would was losing my mind on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h37m55s)

[this I think so I wanted to look real](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h38m00s)

[quick at what was being done here and I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h38m03s)

[cannot resist the urge to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h38m06s)

[clean stuff up when I see it because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h38m09s)

[uh the lifetime of net core right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h48m49s)

[um the the the net core life cycle is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h48m55s)

[significantly shorter right um is you're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h48m59s)

[looking to move to net core one thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m11s)

[that is worth being aware of is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m13s)

[short life cycle now typically the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m16s)

[drops like I just rev the the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m41s)

[framework Monitor and I'm done and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m45s)

[that's it oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m47s)

[461 um you should potentially consider](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m49s)

[getting off of 461 at at minimum 4 61 to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m53s)

[462 should be a simple upgrade with very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h49m57s)

[few breaking changes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m00s)

[um that way you're at least in a a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m03s)

[supported framework because 461 it died](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m06s)

[three years ago or at least you stopped](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m10s)

[getting um like updates for it or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m12s)

[similar so that may be a worthwhile](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m15s)

[thing uh to consider core revs a lot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m18s)

[quicker](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m22s)

[uh yeah I tried to upgrade to six yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m24s)

[and that that will be difficult the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m27s)

[moment you make the jump from framework](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m29s)

[to core there's a lot of things that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m30s)

[change a lot of things that change you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m32s)

[could like you can leverage a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m35s)

[your C but the underlying libraries all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m36s)

[have been revved and have been updated](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m39s)

[and all the cool new stuff is going into](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m41s)

[the net core area so when you it's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m44s)

[pain to get there but if and when you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m47s)

[get there it's a lot nicer so there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m50s)

[that you gain a whole bunch of nicity](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m52s)

[things and a lot of performance gains](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m55s)

[and all that kind of stuff so there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m57s)

[lot of great reasons to go here if you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h50m59s)

[are looking to go here the other thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m01s)

[to be aware of is what they call their](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m02s)

[STS versus LTS release STS is their](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m04s)

[standard release LTS is their long-term](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m08s)

[release the only difference between them](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m10s)

[is how far out the end date is right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m13s)

[you'll note the the um the odd-numbered](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m16s)

[ones two years the even numbered ones](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m19s)

[three years right there are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m23s)

[like that's the difference between them](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m28s)

[because some people are like oh we want](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m29s)

[to be on an LTS version I don't like I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m30s)

[kind of get it right people have slas](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m34s)

[and things that they care about but if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m36s)

[you're if you're revving your stuff at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m38s)

[least every two years um then then you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m40s)

[might as well grab latest right LTS is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m45s)

[for people who can't for whatever reason](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m48s)

[can't afford to rev every two years](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m50s)

[right it's cultural to have Legacy apps](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m53s)

[uh uh I laugh but I feel your pain I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h51m57s)

[feel your pain yeah yeah I I'm I'm well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m00s)

[aware that Izzy probably has some that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m04s)

[might even potentially be older than](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m06s)

[that uh which is terrifying in like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m08s)

[public sector ones there is a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m11s)

[that kind of stuff that that sticks](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m13s)

[around uh must work on Windows 95 see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m14s)

[Izzy the problem is I don't know if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m18s)

[you're joking or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m19s)

[not uh like I I actually fed at a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m21s)

[customer request the other day that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m23s)

[asked about Windows XP support support I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m25s)

[went no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m27s)

[no no we we do not support Windows XP](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m31s)

[I'm I'm I'm sorry that that that ship](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m34s)

[has sailed so yeah so in looking at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m37s)

[those options](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m39s)

[um the like so one at minimum 462 is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m44s)

[something I would be pushing for just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m50s)

[from and again this this only matters if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m52s)

[people care about being in a supported](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m54s)

[version and this is going to be an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m57s)

[unpopular thing but it's like do you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h52m59s)

[care about security patches right some](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m01s)

[people legitimately don't they probably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m04s)

[should but they don't and so if you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m06s)

[don't actually care about those things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m08s)

[it's not as big of a deal but it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m11s)

[oh yeah we kind of care about getting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m12s)

[security patches and updates well you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m14s)

[may want to be up you want to be in this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m16s)

[range if you care about security patches](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m19s)

[that's that's an this this is a happy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m22s)

[place to be um but in terms of going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m23s)

[between those two if you've got an old](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m29s)

[school NET Framework](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m32s)

[aspnet I I guess it depends on what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m38s)

[people's appetite is for a a rewrite](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m40s)

[right because I assume the key thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m44s)

[here um is this net core piece and it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m45s)

[really not the difference between NET](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m49s)

[Framework and net core that's going to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m51s)

[be the hard part it's the difference](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m52s)

[between ASP net and as spnet core those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m54s)

[are a lot further](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h53m58s)

[apart because net and net core there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m00s)

[lot of overlap there most of the apis](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m03s)

[are the same like if most of the time](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m05s)

[what we'll tell people is if you can rev](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m08s)

[yourself up to Net Framework 48 that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m09s)

[means your your uh C is compatible with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m12s)

[uh net standard 20 and that gets you to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m16s)

[net six and net six to net 8 is a really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m18s)

[easy jump so it's like there's a there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m20s)

[a path there but it require and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m22s)

[depending on what people's appetite is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m25s)

[for for rewrite and how big of a thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m27s)

[uh it is that's oftentimes an easy way](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m30s)

[to get yourself](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m32s)

[there but once you but that's for like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m34s)

[c.net BCL core stuff right it's it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m37s)

[easy to get there when we start talking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m41s)

[about the Frameworks like aspn net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m43s)

[core like aspnet and aspnet core are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m45s)

[very different animals um they like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m49s)

[there's a lot there like they didn't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m52s)

[make ASP net different like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m55s)

[drastically uh different they wanted it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h54m58s)

[to feel familiar but you are going to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m01s)

[changing stuff name spaces have changed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m03s)

[um attributes have have subtly changed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m06s)

[if you're sticking with controllers](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m08s)

[it'll still be kind of similar if that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m09s)

[what your old school one uh on net 6 is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m12s)

[doing it'll be fine like you'll you'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m14s)

[get away with a lot of what you know and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m16s)

[it won't be it won't be terrible but it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m18s)

[also depends on how big it is if this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m21s)

[like something that has been built over](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m24s)

[10 years that can be a significant](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m26s)

[amount of code that we're talking about](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m28s)

[moving](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m30s)

[um yeah some of us are lucky we get to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m32s)

[use Linux others use anything from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m35s)

[Windows XP to Windows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m36s)

[8 uh the R&D projects have started using](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m38s)

[Windows 10 oh that's good they've gotten](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m41s)

[themselves up to something in the last](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m45s)

[decade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m46s)

[perfect](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m48s)

[uh uh just expect your di container to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m49s)

[be uh yeah a huge pain absolutely 100%](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m52s)

[um and those are areas where things have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h55m57s)

[have very much shifted right in NET](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m00s)

[Framework you're using Newton soft. Json](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m01s)

[for all your stuff um in newer. net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m04s)

[stuff you're going to be seeing system](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m07s)

[tex. Json and there's subtle differences](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m08s)

[in the serialization there um so there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m11s)

[there's things like that where it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m15s)

[it's just enough different that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m18s)

[don't if somebody had and maybe I'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m22s)

[I'll I'll put it this way to you if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m25s)

[you're if the if the idea is should we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m27s)

[you know move our existing thing forward](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m31s)

[or just kind of split and focus on a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m33s)

[rewrite I would probably base it around](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m35s)

[how much how much code you're looking to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m37s)

[do right if you were looking to upgrade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m41s)

[and and say you know what we want to use](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m44s)

[the existing service let's get that up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m46s)

[to net core what I what I would tell you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m48s)

[to do is Rev it up to Net Framework 48](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m51s)

[right or 481 doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m54s)

[get that running because that's probably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h56m58s)

[not a huge pain in the neck upgrade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m00s)

[right you're going to have to change](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m03s)

[some framework stuff but ASP net between](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m03s)

[these two is very similar there's not a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m07s)

[lot there that's worth changing get that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m09s)

[working that at least guarantees that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m12s)

[your c is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m14s)

[now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m16s)

[uh get yourself almost all the way there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m19s)

[then rev yourself from NET Framework 48](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m23s)

[over to uh net core um and I guess at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m26s)

[that point then you have to make the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m31s)

[decision between are you're going to go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m32s)

[LTS or STS if you want LTS go net 8 STS](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m34s)

[go net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m38s)

[n um and that's and that's where you're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m39s)

[probably going to end up doing a bit of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m43s)

[a a rewrite because your code will work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m45s)

[but you will you're you're almost worth](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m49s)

[walking through the net upgrade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m52s)

[manager because it'll get you close um I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m54s)

[know Ben put this in the chat earlier](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h57m59s)

[of this or the Upgrade Assistant where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m02s)

[is that thing upgrade blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m05s)

[upgrade source](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m09s)

[code yeah this thing here yeah like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m10s)

[thisy this guy here walks walks through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m13s)

[it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m18s)

[uh the one crazy thing that happened](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m20s)

[using your tips at my company was that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m22s)

[my tech lead was fired I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m24s)

[was that a good](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m28s)

[thing I'm concerned yeah yeah I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m31s)

[I'm not sure if I should](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m35s)

[be if that's a compliment or a warning](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m38s)

[or boy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m42s)

[V that that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m44s)

[terrifying](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m46s)

[um yeah but like this entire upgrade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m48s)

[install thing will kind of walk you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m53s)

[through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m55s)

[uh I asked you what you would do you had](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h58m57s)

[nothing to learn from your spirits of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m00s)

[the company and it was my case yeah that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m01s)

[is okay well I'm I'm glad things kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m04s)

[maybe iron themselves out for what it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m10s)

[worth um but yeah like if you're looking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m12s)

[to up so case one right it's we want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m15s)

[keep all of our code we want to upgrade](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m19s)

[to net core great I would I would](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m21s)

[probably go get yourself from net 61 to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m24s)

[net 8 or net 81 doesn't really matter](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m28s)

[then I would walk through a lot of this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m31s)

[upgrade stuff I'm pointing at my screen](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m33s)

[I realize you can't see where I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m35s)

[pointing um I should I should use this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m36s)

[right the key bit is is around here of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m38s)

[going through and the Upgrade Assistant](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m42s)

[will take care of a lot of the Cs prod](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m43s)

[changes for you and get you into a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m45s)

[pretty good place um just know that ASP](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m47s)

[Net's a beast and there's some things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m52s)

[here uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m54s)

[um in terms of going through and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=00h59m57s)

[upgrading all of this stuff right but it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m00s)

[it should get you pretty close right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m03s)

[like Upgrade Assistant at least in my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m07s)

[experience is a good 60 to 80 perish](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m08s)

[solution and then depending on what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m11s)

[you're doing you just got to Hash on it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m13s)

[after that especially for new get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m15s)

[dependencies because you'll find that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m18s)

[you likely have new get dependencies](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m20s)

[that don't have updates so it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m22s)

[what do we do with that functionality](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m25s)

[right hopefully you don't have too many](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m26s)

[of those but you know sometimes people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m28s)

[are building on third party libraries](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m30s)

[it's like yeah that 30 party Library](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m31s)

[never upgraded off of NET](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m33s)

[Framework a suck right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m36s)

[uh dang Izzy and fury both both stepping](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m43s)

[up but it's going really well that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m46s)

[awesome and it worked well Fury I am](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m50s)

[glad to hear that I I was actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m54s)

[having a chat with my boss earlier today](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m56s)

[about kind of mentorship things and and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h00m58s)

[telling people I had a somewhat negative](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m01s)

[opinion on the advice I give to people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m03s)

[but apparently I should say that it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m05s)

[actually works to get people fired not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m06s)

[sure that's the way I want to phrase it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m08s)

[though I should probably do something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m10s)

[different um definitely not the way to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m12s)

[phrase it because it like not the right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m15s)

[thing to do but it especially for people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m18s)

[looking to advance like I I'm glad it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m20s)

[working out and that things are going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m24s)

[better for you for you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m25s)

[um if however the app is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m28s)

[small or the functionality](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m31s)

[isn't Kev has remote control of people's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m34s)

[jobs yeah that is terrifying um if the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m37s)

[if the app is small or the functionality](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m40s)

[can be done peace meal it may be worth](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m42s)

[considering a rewrite something that um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m45s)

[we often do is when people are looking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m47s)

[to bring kind of old Legacy apps if the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m50s)

[the um because often times like old](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m53s)

[school apps can be broken up into kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m57s)

[of logical chunks of functionality](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h01m59s)

[sometimes what we will do is we will](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m02s)

[just leave the old app in place and take](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m03s)

[a chunk of the functionality and rebuild](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m06s)

[that in like latest.net right and we'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m09s)

[just kind of Peace meal it up and then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m12s)

[we'll just slowly cut cut things over](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m14s)

[kind of like if there's if there's kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m15s)

[of like different silos or or different](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m18s)

[areas of the app that we can peace meal](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m20s)

[one at a time we'll often do that just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m22s)

[to kind of keep keep everything working](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m24s)

[and then cut over everything working](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m26s)

[then cut over to a new one and then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m28s)

[slowly build it up and that's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m30s)

[probably more akin to your rewrite one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m32s)

[the advantage there is it lets you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m34s)

[evaluate things in smaller chunks rather](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m37s)

[than trying to do the whole thing at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m39s)

[once and sometimes be a lot easier um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m40s)

[and it gives you an opportunity to kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m44s)

[of Leverage whatever the new stuff is um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m46s)

[that's that's kind of coming so in some](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m49s)

[ways it's easier but it's potentially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m53s)

[slow lower and if you have a a big code](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m55s)

[investment in an old repository that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h02m58s)

[been built out over years that may not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m00s)

[be a good way of doing it right like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m03s)

[that will be a costly way in terms of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m04s)

[time to do it because you're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m07s)

[functionally rewriting the whole app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m08s)

[right and rewrites are things that you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m11s)

[should do very seldom um and after much](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m13s)

[thought and consideration because it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m16s)

[rare that a complete rewrite is a good](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m18s)

[idea right rewriting bits Parts things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m20s)

[upgrades right most of the time we try](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m24s)

[to bring code forward rather than](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m26s)

[throwing it away and rewriting it from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m28s)

[scratch because that's that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m30s)

[painful um right now we're rewriting the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m33s)

[whole app in the web okay well yeah I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m36s)

[mean you you yeah if there at least the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m39s)

[front end is being Rewritten right like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m43s)

[the um if there are areas where it may](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m45s)

[not depending on how your desktop app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m52s)

[was structured sometimes I found that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m54s)

[can take the code like in an mvvm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m56s)

[pattern I can often take my service](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h03m58s)

[layer and translate that into a backend](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m00s)

[API fairly easily but again it depends](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m03s)

[on how the code is set](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m05s)

[up yeah sorry I'm catching up very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m07s)

[active CH I'm I'm I'm now having to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m10s)

[force to like read and stuff um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m12s)

[well thank you Ben I appreciate it the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m26s)

[the comment about uh I think that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m28s)

[something Kevin seems to have done well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m31s)

[if that's the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m33s)

[moment like the I've had a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m42s)

[conversations over the years where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m46s)

[people basically ask the question in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m47s)

[form of hey what do you want to be doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m49s)

[do you see yourself in three years blah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m52s)

[blah blah right those types of of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m53s)

[questions right and I I got asked that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m55s)

[at one point where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h04m59s)

[the I I had I'd given an answer that was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m02s)

[like you know what I really like coding](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m05s)

[I like having my hands on the keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m07s)

[typing is a good thing I like making](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m09s)

[code happen and then I realized that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m11s)

[have a lot of opportunities to make code](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m15s)

[happen right like I do the streaming I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m18s)

[work on the material design project I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m20s)

[work on velop Pac like I if I want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m22s)

[write code I am not short on projects to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m26s)

[write code for like I can I can do that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m29s)

[and so at least in my day job I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m32s)

[mind as much if I don't get to be the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m35s)

[guy with the the hands on the keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m37s)

[all the time like it's not it's not like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m38s)

[it's one of those things where I have an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m41s)

[itch like and it's we'll call it an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m43s)

[addiction right I must write code I must](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m45s)

[build software I have to do that like I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m48s)

[must make that happen but it some there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m51s)

[uh somebody once told me it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m55s)

[sometimes you need to understand what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m57s)

[should be a hobby and what should be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h05m58s)

[job right and it's nice when those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m01s)

[things overlap but they may not always](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m03s)

[overlap and sometimes they overlap for a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m06s)

[while and then they don't and so it goes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m08s)

[back and forth and it's like I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m10s)

[some and in some cases it's like you do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m13s)

[a hobby to turn it into a a career or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m15s)

[similar right and sometimes it goes the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m18s)

[other direction right what you did as a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m20s)

[career kind of becomes a hobby this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m21s)

[in theory what happens when people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m24s)

[retire](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m25s)

[I've yet to see somebody do it well but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m26s)

[you know what there's that but there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m28s)

[it's it's it's an interesting question](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m32s)

[of what should be done so something wor](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m34s)

[something worth considering especially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m38s)

[as you work your way up uh let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m39s)

[see good news my company decided to stop](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h06m43s)

[set up like a a demo thing or something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m14s)

[because I know we I know we've got a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m16s)

[demo like you could go sign up for the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m18s)

[beta too and that'll get you into one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m20s)

[tenant or an actual video thing or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m24s)

[something disappointing some of it is is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m27s)

[the it's it's a piece of software that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m30s)

[we actively are working on like every](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m32s)

[are adding features and fixing bugs and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m37s)

[doing stuff to it so it's one of those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m39s)

[things it's it's very much an active](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m41s)

[thing but it's also a product that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m43s)

[they're looking to try to sell out too](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m44s)

[see uh let's see private tutoring I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m48s)

[would share my pal so Fury the answer is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m51s)

[yes and no the same time so on one hand](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m54s)

[yes I do have uh like uh the GitHub](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h09m57s)

[sponsor thing set up uh as a way of if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m01s)

[people want it um I will warn you I have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m06s)

[a very limited schedule and so there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m10s)

[been a handful of people that have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m13s)

[wanted to go down that route but the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m14s)

[scheduling thing ended up being a major](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m16s)

[a major pain um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m19s)

[so is it something I will do for people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m21s)

[and and do it yes but I also have a very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m24s)

[limited number of hours and often times](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m27s)

[scheduling tends to be the big](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m30s)

[limitation uh oh shoot I'm sitting here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m32s)

[I'm clicking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m35s)

[on here let me let me go back here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m36s)

[so I I realize I'm talking about screens](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m39s)

[and all that stuff and I'm not actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m42s)

[showing things so I think this is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m44s)

[right site](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m46s)

[here from the castle.com so if people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m48s)

[don't know The Princess Bride the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m50s)

[company leans very heavily on Princess](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m52s)

[Bride jokes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m54s)

[um and then there is this is the beta](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h10m55s)

[program right uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m00s)

[here uh why does every mention of Link](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m03s)

[in the Microsoft docs looks like like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m05s)

[they're trying to sell it to me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m06s)

[yeah yeah so link is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m10s)

[good but it it's one of those tools that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m14s)

[I think requires it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m17s)

[deceptively difficult at times um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m21s)

[especially when you start mixing in for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m23s)

[like Entity framework for database](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m25s)

[queries are similar like it does a lot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m27s)

[of stuff that's really nice and the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m29s)

[amount that you need to know to get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m31s)

[started is kind of low but the amount](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m32s)

[that you need to know to do it really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m34s)

[well gets pretty high so there's there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m36s)

[a little bit in there um and I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m39s)

[that's probably part of it um let's see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m41s)

[here yeah I mean private tutoring on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m46s)

[your knowledge and things like that not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m48s)

[your company product yeah no and if if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m49s)

[there is if there are people who are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m52s)

[interested and I will will I will point](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m53s)

[this out like this is this is something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m56s)

[that I and I I might actually need to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h11m58s)

[check](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m01s)

[look that's not the right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m04s)

[site uh oh does it not oh it doesn't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m07s)

[show me my sponsor thing well if you go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m11s)

[to my GitHub profile and you hit the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m14s)

[sponsor one because I'm going to get a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m15s)

[different view looking at it from here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m16s)

[there there is an opportunity there like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m18s)

[I said if it's something people are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m21s)

[interested in like I said the scheduling](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m22s)

[tends to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m24s)

[a potentially big issue so if somebody's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m26s)

[looking to do it um I would I would say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m28s)

[reach out via Discord um first and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m31s)

[confirm scheduling before people get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m36s)

[carried away because like I said I've](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m38s)

[got a very limited hours right now and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m40s)

[that may end up being uh a Do or Die](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m42s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m45s)

[uh oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m47s)

[good Ben's trying to see what the that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m51s)

[they have on a demo one yeah Ben if you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m53s)

[got a Dem one grab it and I'll show it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m54s)

[cuz I I thought we had a storm in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h12m58s)

[castle like demo tenant or something or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m00s)

[similar yeah again Izzy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m02s)

[yeah uh does it can it integrate with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m09s)

[sap uh does not currently integrate with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m12s)

[sap but we do a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m14s)

[Integrations for uh like here in the US](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m18s)

[uh sap gets used quite a bit for power](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m21s)

[companies and so we've done we've done](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m24s)

[sap Integrations and uh we built out the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m26s)

[storm in the castle stuff so could it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m31s)

[possibly that might be a discussion on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m34s)

[what on what you're looking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m36s)

[for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m38s)

[um yeah because because we've done we've](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m40s)

[done sap Integrations and for for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m42s)

[different stuff but it like I said it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m45s)

[might it might be a question of what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m47s)

[what needs to happen but yeah if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m49s)

[company's interested let me know and we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m51s)

[can uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m53s)

[uh like I said happy to set up a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m56s)

[discussion or similar if people are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h13m58s)

[interested in seeing more uh have you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m00s)

[ever seen a Russian programming](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m02s)

[language Google oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m03s)

[boy okay I'm going to do this but I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m07s)

[also going to do this because this feels](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m09s)

[like something that potentially gets me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m12s)

[in trouble](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m14s)

[um wait](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m20s)

[Russian](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m30s)

[um here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m39s)

[the Wiki](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m41s)

[page](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m47s)

[dang I will say the development World](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m49s)

[very much favors the English stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m52s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m55s)

[it's like it's almost because I I've](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h14m57s)

[worked with a lot of uh developers with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m00s)

[different countries and usually it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m03s)

[around like variable naming and comments](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m04s)

[and things where you start getting the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m06s)

[weirdness it's like I can always read](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m07s)

[the code but like something like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m09s)

[this yeah this is for people watching I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m11s)

[I have run the translate because that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m14s)

[the only way I can even hope to read any](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m17s)

[part of this kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m19s)

[interesting very interesting okay I got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m23s)

[I got got got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m26s)

[DET something something something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m28s)

[something UI test okay so I whacked the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m30s)

[window because the window was just doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m34s)

[this and bound numeric up down control](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m38s)

[is a user control and this guy here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m43s)

[literally drops it into a blank material](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m46s)

[design](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m49s)

[window so it does it does](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m50s)

[this and and builds that up so it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m53s)

[somewhat straightforward let's run this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m56s)

[test see what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h15m59s)

[happens in retrospect I probably should](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m02s)

[have run this test before mucking with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m04s)

[stuff but that's just not me I gotta](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m07s)

[muck with stuff gotta change I gotta](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m10s)

[gota like make code happen and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m20s)

[yeah R Russians are used to the fact](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m29s)

[that the code is always in English and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m31s)

[the code is in Russian for me as a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m33s)

[native speaker of the Russian language](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m36s)

[it looks wild yeah well it I will admit](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m37s)

[like for me it's it's weird because like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m42s)

[learned has always effectively been](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m49s)

[English symbols right like even if I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m50s)

[don't know the words I can line the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m52s)

[symbols up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m54s)

[and you know sometimes you look at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m55s)

[something like uh uh like rust or Pascal](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h16m56s)

[or um what is the the other one that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m02s)

[had to work with and even though it's it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m05s)

[looks weird to me because it's you know](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m09s)

[it's not letters anymore it's just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m10s)

[random symbols coming at me it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m12s)

[they always](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m13s)

[felt native is the wrong word they felt](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m15s)

[familiar even if it's like yes of course](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m17s)

[it's dollar sign colon hyphen you know](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m19s)

[greater than sign that's obviously what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m22s)

[that that set of symbols means it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m25s)

[like I'm very aware that if I show that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m28s)

[to a non-programmer they look at it like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m29s)

[it's a foreign language as well so it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m31s)

[it's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m34s)

[a yeah it it definitely looks a little](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m35s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m40s)

[wild okay let's see what do we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m43s)

[got fail to move Focus to element](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m46s)

[numeric up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m49s)

[down okay so numeric up down down is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m51s)

[here so I kind of want to just grab](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m55s)

[this and then I want to go up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h17m59s)

[and this guy here attach debugger to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m05s)

[remote process false I would like to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m09s)

[able to disjoint those things okay so by](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m12s)

[not having the debugger attached to the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m17s)

[remote process it means the window this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m19s)

[thing is going to start going to run in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m21s)

[a separate process and my debugger will](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m23s)

[only be attached to the unit test great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m25s)

[so what do we got here so we've got this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m28s)

[and effectively what we're saying is we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m31s)

[expect Focus to move to that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m33s)

[element](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m36s)

[right interesting that it ends up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m41s)

[throwing saying that it can't move Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m47s)

[despite the fact that Focus moved to it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m50s)

[um I am willing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m53s)

[bet let's see set property activating](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h18m58s)

[window getting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m02s)

[element getting element with uh with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m05s)

[query button to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m08s)

[focus yeah okay so this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m13s)

[is an interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m16s)

[one didn't we just right one the other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m22s)

[day where we moved Focus inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m25s)

[it kind of want to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m36s)

[this and then I kind of want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m39s)

[go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m44s)

[um because we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m47s)

[did could have sworn we did move](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m49s)

[keyboard focus on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m52s)

[numeric control but maybe I'm making](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m55s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h19m58s)

[up interest interesting interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m02s)

[interesting because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m05s)

[I kind of want to look at my zaml test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m11s)

[real](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m14s)

[quick and check and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m15s)

[see uh oh I've got some dependabot stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m19s)

[I got to deal with to self](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m22s)

[let's open this up really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m25s)

[quick for those people who didn't see it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m27s)

[it was my magical control shift e open](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m29s)

[repo and external editor one of my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m32s)

[favorite favorite features um that they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m35s)

[added um so external tools I just have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m39s)

[it pointed at Visual Studio at the XE](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m42s)

[and it will feed in the um the current](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m46s)

[working directory which is the repo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m49s)

[route so then Visual Studio opens in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m50s)

[solution Explorer that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m54s)

[here and then I just have to click on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m56s)

[the solution to get all the way in well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h20m58s)

[it's not it's not perfect but it's real](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m01s)

[bloody](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m03s)

[close uh let's see uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m04s)

[Focus uh I think focus is in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m09s)

[element move keyboard Focus this one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m15s)

[it's an input yeah sure fine safe way I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m19s)

[don't care so it comes in here pulls the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m21s)

[element out grabs the window make sure](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m24s)

[the window's activated keyboard Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m26s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m29s)

[element so it moves keyboard to the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m31s)

[element and then keyboard Focus I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m35s)

[wondering if this not equals is actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m38s)

[the problem because then if this hits it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m40s)

[moves out of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m43s)

[here and then element](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m50s)

[is UI element element.](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m56s)

[Focus this feels like I want to expand](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h21m58s)

[this a little bit because I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m01s)

[bet part of the issue of why this thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m03s)

[is is failing on this call here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m05s)

[because if I remember correctly we had a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m08s)

[focus thing on the numeric up down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m11s)

[base numeric up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m16s)

[down uh sorry it's up down base this guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m19s)

[here I believe believe we set](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m23s)

[up oh it was on Focus lost maybe that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m27s)

[what I'm thinking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m31s)

[of I thought because we were definitely](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m33s)

[handling some Focus events inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m36s)

[here on got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m38s)

[Focus yeah it does this kind of thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m41s)

[okay we're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m45s)

[gonna we're gonna come in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m46s)

[here is this moves the focus in and I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m52s)

[I'm kind of wondering I'm kind of wonder](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m55s)

[if this is actually a failure failure of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m56s)

[zaml test case we might just go focus it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h22m58s)

[or uh fix it go here go here and then if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m01s)

[we go up to here test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m05s)

[base that beer true because I actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m08s)

[want to debug inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m11s)

[the uh the remote](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m15s)

[window oh that's that's run test that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m20s)

[not debug test that's not going to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m22s)

[what I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m24s)

[wanted](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m26s)

[uh oh yeah sure up down yeah great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m28s)

[thanks go away die](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m31s)

[great because I want to I I'm willing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m34s)

[bet that's part of the issue](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m37s)

[is yep so this guy got Focus so the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m42s)

[numeric control got the focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m46s)

[event and then it's going to move the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m49s)

[focus down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m52s)

[that recurses into](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m57s)

[here great great great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h23m59s)

[um that moves us there e. handle do true](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m05s)

[Bippity boity booya okay so that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m10s)

[fundamentally the problem is zaml test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m14s)

[is too stupid to handle something of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m16s)

[this nature okay the good news is if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m18s)

[only I knew somebody who could fix it oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m21s)

[look me okay uh so keyboard Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m23s)

[request I think what I want to do is I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m28s)

[don't like this um this check is too](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m30s)

[simplistic um I think what I actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m35s)

[want to do if element is a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m37s)

[child of it because this guy is I input](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m42s)

[element which is not quite](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m46s)

[enough](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m48s)

[um so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m51s)

[go here we go here we go here our](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m54s)

[keyboard Focus right do that uh if G](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h24m57s)

[Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m05s)

[uh I don't want to change the behavior](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m08s)

[completely I I want to extend it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m10s)

[though um because what I would like to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m13s)

[know is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m16s)

[if uh keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m17s)

[Focus uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m20s)

[if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m24s)

[elmet is keyboard Focus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m26s)

[within I think it's it's this that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m32s)

[want is if the focus doesn't move](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m35s)

[in to the element that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m42s)

[problematic um and I actually so the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m49s)

[success case is if element](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m52s)

[uh is keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h25m56s)

[focused I think I actually want not on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m00s)

[both of these so if it's not keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m03s)

[focused and keyboard Focus isn't within](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m04s)

[it then we will do the air](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m06s)

[message yeah I think that works uh let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m16s)

[go test run all tests real quick oh this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m19s)

[might be hang on I just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m22s)

[realized uh test explore that might be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m24s)

[yeah we don't want to do that I would](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m28s)

[like to only run some of the test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m30s)

[Please can probably drop the out of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m37s)

[support frame vers ah screw it we'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m40s)

[just release the examl test version why](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m42s)

[not it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m45s)

[10:30 Visual Studio release not the time](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m47s)

[to install it absolutely not the time to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m50s)

[install it but would be really fun to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m53s)

[but what you guys can't see is over on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m56s)

[my other screen I'm getting Windows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m58s)

[flashing at me very exciting it's kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h26m59s)

[of like what's occasionally showing up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m01s)

[here except for I'm getting it twice as](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m03s)

[much it's really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m05s)

[great all right I have a test that I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m10s)

[think launches](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m12s)

[notepad um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m17s)

[I yeah this may actually not work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m22s)

[locally at the moment what I really care](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m27s)

[to run is visual element test this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m29s)

[the only set of tests I care](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m31s)

[about yes I apologize if anybody has uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m35s)

[that uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m53s)

[um ideally I put together a test for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h27m54s)

[one if Windows 12 will include net 12](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m13s)

[instead of net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m16s)

[418 I so I think they're going to keep](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m18s)

[including NET Framework for a while](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m22s)

[while like Ms build if you build like a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m24s)

[your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m29s)

[own Ms build uh Target or not Target](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m29s)

[task um you to do it right you have to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m37s)

[Target net standard or multi-target](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m42s)

[between NET Framework and net core](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m44s)

[because depending on how you build your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m46s)

[C inside of Visual Studio on Windows you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m48s)

[Framework still](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m53s)

[if you do net build on the command line](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m54s)

[you get a net core version it's really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m57s)

[frustrating like there's enough Legacy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h33m59s)

[like Visual Studio has been built over](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m01s)

[decades like there's a lot of code in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m03s)

[here and not all of it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m06s)

[love to just invest in killing off all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m11s)

[the Legacy stuff I just think it's a uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m13s)

[a cost too](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m17s)

[high right now for them and they're on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m18s)

[their AI crazees I think they're chasing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m20s)

[the idea of oh we right AI to replace](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m22s)

[all of our Legacy code for us won't that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m24s)

[be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h34m26s)

[that you have a full](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h36m54s)

[thing check to make sure I didn't miss](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m05s)

[anything and let's see close close close](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m08s)

[close close close close](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m11s)

[close Okay so if we go back to here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m18s)

[all right well I'm waiting for that to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m24s)

[run I want to launch the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m26s)

[app uh actually stop executing kill the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m29s)

[breakpoint launch the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m32s)

[app CU I think that little screen](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m36s)

[capture is just straight from the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m39s)

[app I was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m42s)

[guessing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m45s)

[yeah so the idea here is if I type in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m46s)

[2.5 right and then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m51s)

[what is the min max on this min max is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m55s)

[2.5 go back I want to make sure I get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h37m59s)

[the these setup things correct](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m03s)

[right so it types in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m06s)

[555 moves the focus and then it drops](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m09s)

[okay so if I do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m13s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m15s)

[555 I guess this thing isn't data bound](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m19s)

[though so maybe I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m22s)

[okay okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m26s)

[that's that is potentially what I am](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m28s)

[missing is this guy isn't data bound and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m32s)

[the other one had a view model](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m35s)

[change so if I do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m37s)

[Snoop I wonder if I can see a difference](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m41s)

[with the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m44s)

[value popup I got in the demo app oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m48s)

[uh yeah so this thing here so this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h38m58s)

[something and I I probably should change](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m00s)

[the theming because it's hard to see in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m02s)

[dark mode this little guy here this nice](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m03s)

[called show me the zaml because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m27s)

[sometimes you legitimately just want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m30s)

[see the zaml so if you're in the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m32s)

[app and you see this zamel display](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m33s)

[control that's all this is is it's uh an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m35s)

[anchor point to put one of those little](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m38s)

[buttons in there so that it shows the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m40s)

[the zaml stuff and you can you can copy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m43s)

[want to make it more visible in Dark](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m51s)

[theme right because it's it's it's not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m54s)

[obvious that it's that it's in there but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m56s)

[it's it's kind of an interesting problem](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h39m59s)

[when you say hey show me the original](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m01s)

[zaml that was in this control because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m04s)

[the original zaml once the app is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m08s)

[compiled is lost because in WPF your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m10s)

[zaml gets compiled down into something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m13s)

[called bamel uh which is binary markup](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m14s)

[language which is faster to load and all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m18s)

[that funz great fine the problem is is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m20s)

[if you decompile it you get it's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m23s)

[like looking at decompiled C you get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m26s)

[something that's close to what the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m27s)

[original was but it's not quite the same](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m29s)

[right so show me the zaml actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m32s)

[cheats what it does is it rips through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m34s)

[all of your zaml files um loads them up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m36s)

[as XML finds the original zaml and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m39s)

[builds one massive](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m42s)

[dictionary](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m44s)

[um to uh uh to that's locked to the keys](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m46s)

[because if I go in here right and I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m51s)

[go fuchsia Izzy don't joke I will do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m54s)

[that so the zaml display control](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h40m59s)

[requires this unique key and the reason](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m02s)

[it needs a unique key is because all of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m03s)

[the the the content inside of it is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m06s)

[going to go into a dictionary and the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m09s)

[dictionary is going to be keyed on a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m11s)

[string and that's the key of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m12s)

[dictionary and the string and so when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m14s)

[you click the button all it's all the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m16s)

[button click for the popup is doing is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m18s)

[looking at the dictionary and going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m20s)

[here's my key give me back out the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m21s)

[string and the string is captured at or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m23s)

[the that dictionary is built at compile](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m26s)

[time so at compile time it just rips](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m29s)

[through and grabs it and pulls it all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m32s)

[out uh fun story The Uno project](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m33s)

[actually made a fork of this and ported](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m36s)

[it to Uno because they liked it so much](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m39s)

[they wanted it in their](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m40s)

[demo I thought that was funny I was like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h41m42s)

[how it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m11s)

[works like it's it's an interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m12s)

[little little tidbit of things to play](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m15s)

[with right like there's the core Library](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m18s)

[there's the little Ms buildy stuff that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m20s)

[bu builds up the zaml dictionary right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m22s)

[so again kind of key Point here if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m25s)

[all the way up to version 20](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m49s)

[and I haven't really had to touch s it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m51s)

[one of those things it just keeps on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m54s)

[trucking keeps on a trucking I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m56s)

[this is one of the Uno guys](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h42m59s)

[yeah yeah this guy contributed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m02s)

[back which was very nice the CTO of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m05s)

[Uno platform yeah so they found my stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m07s)

[and they thought it was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m10s)

[interesting and I thought that was kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m12s)

[cool](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m14s)

[um okay so I think what I want is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m16s)

[a I want a view model behind this sucker](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m20s)

[that I can bind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m23s)

[to right so public](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m25s)

[class](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m29s)

[uh Amic view model let's stop debugging](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m32s)

[so it doesn't yell at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m36s)

[me uh let's see um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m38s)

[servable](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m43s)

[object so close co-pilot you are so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m46s)

[close let me help you there you go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m49s)

[better uh and I would like you to be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m51s)

[double I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m54s)

[think and then you want to be partial so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m55s)

[that the source generator can do the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h43m59s)

[needful great and then we're going to go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m00s)

[up here and we're going to say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m03s)

[you to be block data contacts gets new](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m05s)

[thank you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m11s)

[up uh let's see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m21s)

[here oh this is decimal up down isn't it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m25s)

[decimal up down is going to want it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m29s)

[shockingly to be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m31s)

[decimal Le I think I think that's what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m34s)

[decimal decimal up down is yeah of type](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m37s)

[decimal okay going to say be kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m40s)

[stupid if we made decimal up down and it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m42s)

[was of type double or something like a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m45s)

[very misleading name uh okay and so min](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m47s)

[max and I want to take](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m52s)

[value and I want to bind it to was it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h44m55s)

[value yeah and then I want to do a text](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m02s)

[box or text block I guess text](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m06s)

[by had it there missed it uh just so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m09s)

[that I can see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m13s)

[it and let's stack panel](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m16s)

[you do the needful](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m21s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m24s)

[needful the need yep uh wow I appear to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m25s)

[be getting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m29s)

[laggy cool is he have fun playing with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m31s)

[your kid thanks for coming and hanging](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m34s)

[out as always always good to see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m36s)

[you okay now if we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m39s)

[launch I think this gets me close at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m44s)

[least close to recreating the issue that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m47s)

[was there but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m49s)

[I just want to confirm that there is or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m51s)

[isn't a problem because I realize it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m54s)

[really looks like there's a bug right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h45m57s)

[so that works great right and then I go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m00s)

[five55 and I go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m04s)

[here that is not a good thing okay so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m10s)

[that that clearly is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m14s)

[bad and that's what the the test was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m16s)

[supposed to indicate but the test has a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m18s)

[bug because the examle test and blah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m20s)

[blah blah well deal with that in a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m22s)

[minute but what I would like to do here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m23s)

[is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m26s)

[partial uh on value](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m27s)

[changed and then I would like you to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m31s)

[block body please just so that I have an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m34s)

[anchor point for F9](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m37s)

[button I want to walk this this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m44s)

[backwards I'm surprised that that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m47s)

[what's happening like I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m48s)

[realize I realize both uh Nikolai and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m51s)

[Corvin both called me out on my mistake](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m55s)

[like I get it but I I also don't get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h46m59s)

[it like something something isn't jiving](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m02s)

[with my knowledge of how WPF works okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m05s)

[so if I go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m08s)

[555 tab on value changed 555 okay we're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m10s)

[going to walk this sucker backwards real](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m16s)

[quick there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m18s)

[set on value changed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m20s)

[right up down base set value](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m23s)

[property at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m27s)

[that why did that not go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m30s)

[through why did that not go through the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m39s)

[coer like I I get what's happening right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m46s)

[the value that came in was 555 I totally](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m48s)

[get that my expectation though is that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m51s)

[this code is executed before it assigns](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h47m55s)

[it back what am I missing oh does it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m00s)

[execute oh it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m03s)

[ex](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m10s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m13s)

[oh oh I've done this before and I'm an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m15s)

[idiot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m18s)

[oh that's what I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m23s)

[okay that okay okay okay okay so I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m30s)

[what I said last time is what I would](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m35s)

[somewhat prefer to do here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m38s)

[is let's come down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m42s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m45s)

[uh private](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m47s)

[void uh clamp that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m50s)

[value and then I think this is a t right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m53s)

[yeah so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h48m56s)

[value and I what I would love to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m00s)

[is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m05s)

[this because I would like that to live](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m08s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m13s)

[um because I want to use the value in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m19s)

[both plac places but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m22s)

[I yeah um so we're going to do that that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m29s)

[because really the only reason for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m34s)

[calling coer was to get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m36s)

[this this thing here uh and so this is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m39s)

[going to be up down base uh clamp value](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m43s)

[numeric value right because this is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m48s)

[bit of code that we want to share in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m50s)

[both places](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m51s)

[uh and I was an idiot and didn't make](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m56s)

[that thing return a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h49m59s)

[t what it needs to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m01s)

[do and then down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m03s)

[here clamp](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m06s)

[value](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m11s)

[um that's clam not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m14s)

[clamp and then value here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m18s)

[possible null reference assignment Tri](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m22s)

[parse should be non-null when this thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m26s)

[returns true is this thing not decorated](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m28s)

[appropriately](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m30s)

[ah so this is this is a this is a a good](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m32s)

[a good moment here right so if we go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m36s)

[back all right so the the warning here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m38s)

[in question right is uh possible no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m41s)

[reference assignment because the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m44s)

[compiler is realizing oh this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m46s)

[value is T question mark this could be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m49s)

[null however this trip parse is not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m53s)

[going to return null or I should say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m57s)

[value will not be null when tripar](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h50m59s)

[returns](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m02s)

[true right this is the common pattern](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m03s)

[that you see on things like int tripar](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m05s)

[right but if we look at in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m08s)

[tripar](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m14s)

[uh oh in triar doesn't have it because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m15s)

[ins are not nullable where is what's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m19s)

[what's a good Tri parse one that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m21s)

[wouldn't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m23s)

[be that would do it for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m25s)

[me think of which ones actually have it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m29s)

[with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m33s)

[triar no because that that's also going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m35s)

[to be a value](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m37s)

[type this isn't quite what I'm looking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m40s)

[for uh is we want this thing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m44s)

[allow um a value short version](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m49s)

[uh why nullable T no that's that's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m53s)

[great question uh carax so the part of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m55s)

[the reason for that is because of how T](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h51m59s)

[is declared up here where T is an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m02s)

[arithmetic like we could go this route](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m06s)

[here and then when we fall into here we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m08s)

[propagate that to here right and build](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m11s)

[that up maybe](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m13s)

[this uh then this guy becomes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m17s)

[this uh let's see no literal to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m21s)

[possible oh because T is still](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m27s)

[potentially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m29s)

[nullable yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m30s)

[um right um but the the simpler solution](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m35s)

[here is we can actually control the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m39s)

[compiler so in this case the reason for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m43s)

[it is because we are using some of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m47s)

[uh newer what is the right term for this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m52s)

[static interface](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m55s)

[members uh to be able to link in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h52m58s)

[arithmetic operations which is why you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m01s)

[see this if net 8 or greater um because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m04s)

[for example if I change myself to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m08s)

[targeting the net 8](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m09s)

[stuff come on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m11s)

[update uh uh it's misleading as T](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m21s)

[question mark yeah it no it it it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m24s)

[absolutely it absolutely is misleading](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m26s)

[and I think my my compiler is losing its](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m30s)

[mind at the moment because it's not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m32s)

[updating](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m33s)

[properly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m35s)

[um because when it goes through](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m38s)

[here this guy yeah so this is the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m41s)

[way that it this is actually decorated](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m47s)

[for doing the arithmetic oper operations](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m50s)

[saying that this Tri](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m53s)

[parse the the out value might be null](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h53m57s)

[when the value is false this is how this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m01s)

[thing is um decorated and I believe what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m04s)

[we actually want to do is forward this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m08s)

[in to um our implementations as well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m10s)

[right so we want it more akin to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m15s)

[this and I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m18s)

[this guy gets away with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m23s)

[becoming this because it now allows that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m25s)

[to flow through I think we just got lazy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m29s)

[with the question mark yeah not no when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m31s)

[true no absolutely um I think though I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m33s)

[I want to favor this only because that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m37s)

[that effectively follows the same](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m40s)

[tripar from that we're leveraging in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m43s)

[net 8](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m45s)

[stuff and I believe what I want to do is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m47s)

[this and this and this is probably going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m51s)

[to give me crap because it doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m53s)

[in all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m56s)

[cases](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h54m58s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m01s)

[uh I'm GNA have to flip myself here down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m04s)

[into that one to go and grab it because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m06s)

[this is one of those cases where we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m09s)

[might just shim the sucker in and call](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m11s)

[it a day do that that because we had to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m13s)

[shim in the eye arithmetic interface](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m17s)

[what for everything below net 8 in order](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m21s)

[to make this actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m23s)

[compile and so if I do this wait for the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m26s)

[compiler to catch up to me apparently](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m30s)

[this is going to be a hard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m32s)

[operation and actually now that you say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m37s)

[that I am wondering if maybe n when was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m39s)

[added later than not null](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m43s)

[when might check that we should check](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m47s)

[that when ever the compiler wants to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m51s)

[catch up to me any day now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m53s)

[Roslin we're all just waiting on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h55m57s)

[you is we should need to declare it uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m07s)

[because for example here this one's not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m10s)

[a problem because it's obviously an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m12s)

[INT um do you set up to use C 12 F on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m15s)

[net 6 uh instead of of using regions](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m19s)

[yeah so it depends a little bit um on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m24s)

[what feature in question it is but in a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m27s)

[lot of cases](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m31s)

[will um I I will shim in features to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m33s)

[make them work and it depends on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m37s)

[feature because some features are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m39s)

[compiler level and some features are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m41s)

[runtime level so things like the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m43s)

[attributes and similar those are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m47s)

[compiler features that are that are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m48s)

[being leveraged so the the the compiler](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m50s)

[is just looking for an attribute with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m53s)

[the right namespace and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m56s)

[name but that attribute exists in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h56m58s)

[newer. net libraries but don't exist in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m00s)

[say things like net 6 but if you declare](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m03s)

[that same attribute with the right name](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m05s)

[space and name you can actually get the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m08s)

[newer compiler features to work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m10s)

[targeting net 6 as long as you're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m12s)

[compiling with the newer. net SDK and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m15s)

[targeting net6 if that if that makes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m18s)

[sense because there's a dis the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m20s)

[the version of net that you compile with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m23s)

[in my opinion you should generally favor](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m25s)

[using latest because then you get all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m27s)

[the latest compiler fanciness um and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m29s)

[then Target older Frameworks if you need](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m33s)

[to that's totally fine um but then you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m35s)

[can you can actually leverage them are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m39s)

[you still trying to figure yourself](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m42s)

[out](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m46s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m48s)

[okay yeah and so you've absolutely lost](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m50s)

[your mind okay and this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m54s)

[is yeah so it's just it's it's both of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m57s)

[these yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h57m59s)

[change this so you so you actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m02s)

[switch and show me do you actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m04s)

[contain not know when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m08s)

[through but you don't exist either do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m11s)

[you not in 462 you don't but you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m14s)

[probably exist in net](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m17s)

[6 do we just go ahead and Port that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m21s)

[sucker right on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m23s)

[down do we just Port that sucker right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m29s)

[on down into it because the other thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m32s)

[is is anyone could theoretically derive](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m35s)

[from this same interface and pass in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m37s)

[their own type and so I don't want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m39s)

[assume that just because my types are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m41s)

[decimal and int that somebody won't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m43s)

[implement it their own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m45s)

[way I kind of want to get the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m47s)

[interface to work nicely I'm just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m50s)

[worried that if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m53s)

[I if I put this member](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h58m58s)

[in I put this one in because you can see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m10s)

[here exists on net 6 right but not on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m14s)

[462 so I I'd have to shim it in for 462](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m18s)

[um can I get away with doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m29s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m38s)

[uh if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m46s)

[not let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m49s)

[I want to I want to see if I can get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m53s)

[away with doing this as a non-public](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=01h59m54s)

[class uh yeah I understand you're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m00s)

[unhappy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m02s)

[um yeah and you want to be in your own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m06s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m10s)

[place will you automatically no I want](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m12s)

[you to move to a new file what I want](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m14s)

[you to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m17s)

[uh let's see where we at in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m24s)

[here don't happen to have a good place](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m26s)

[already to shim these I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m29s)

[think still uses old NET Framework sadly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m34s)

[sadly carax a couple of the people who](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m38s)

[were in the chat earlier](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m40s)

[tonight uh it is it is the gift that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m43s)

[will not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m47s)

[die um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m48s)

[so and it's one of those things where at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m53s)

[least for the material design Library my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m56s)

[opinion is is I will try to maintain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h00m59s)

[support for a framework as long as](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m01s)

[Microsoft](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m03s)

[does once Microsoft drops support um I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m07s)

[me any heartache it um it's going on The](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m21s)

[Block uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m26s)

[okay let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m30s)

[just so we've got this guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m32s)

[here right and this is this is kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m35s)

[the same way as we've shimmed in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m38s)

[the um compiler](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m41s)

[uh so this is trying to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m54s)

[leverage this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h01m57s)

[guy and we just got to do this to make](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m03s)

[it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m06s)

[happy okay now that'll get me to there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m08s)

[obviously that's not where I wanted to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m12s)

[live long](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m13s)

[term but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m14s)

[now not know when true that should get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m17s)

[me far enough along to deal with all of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m22s)

[the implementations of this guy there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m24s)

[only three](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m26s)

[references given how much crap this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m31s)

[thing's giving me and how slow it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m33s)

[being on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m35s)

[loading I think we can conclude it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m38s)

[going dog](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m41s)

[slow okay but all of that to say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m42s)

[now this guy should no longer be having](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m49s)

[problems when I go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m52s)

[to clamp it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m55s)

[yeah I think we can do no because the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h02m58s)

[Declaration is still](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m01s)

[nullable but it is no longer null uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m03s)

[open source on get yeah yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m06s)

[uh here I'll drop you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m08s)

[link that repo there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m14s)

[okay so that gets us that gets us there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m22s)

[and now I think if we launch the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m25s)

[app this this should address the issue](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m27s)

[at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m30s)

[hand do is now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m33s)

[empty okay because we may we may end](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m46s)

[up if we're going to move forward with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m49s)

[this the the fact that it's letting me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m51s)

[get away with this as an internal class](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m53s)

[makes me feel better because that will](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m55s)

[keep me from accidentally colliding with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h03m57s)

[other people because I know plenty of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m00s)

[projects that also shim this type of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m02s)

[stuff in as](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m04s)

[well and I just don't want my shim to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m05s)

[conflict with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m08s)

[theirs because that is frustrating when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m10s)

[it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m13s)

[happens okay so kill the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m15s)

[breakpoint launch the app okay so key](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m19s)

[thing here right we go up to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m23s)

[oh kill that kill that so we're going to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m26s)

[move our way up to two and a half 555](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m29s)

[tab okay and it is appropriately clamp](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m34s)

[now okay that makes me feel better let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m37s)

[get this guy moved](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m41s)

[to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m43s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m44s)

[uh to its own area I think I have my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m50s)

[own yeah we've got our own shims in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h04m57s)

[here or index](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m01s)

[of um let's let's move it into here uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m05s)

[let's see add new](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m09s)

[class not no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m14s)

[when I'm back over here I would like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m18s)

[most of this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m23s)

[file except for not any of this stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m25s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m31s)

[and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m32s)

[yeah gu here I want to kill this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m35s)

[off and now it's all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m41s)

[happy now it's all happy I guess we can](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m44s)

[go to no don't do that no stop it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m47s)

[co-pilot stop it stop stop it stop it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m50s)

[stop it stop it stop it I know ID is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m52s)

[unhappy but we can get away with this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m55s)

[now this way if we decide to bring in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h05m58s)

[any of the other ones we're already kind](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m00s)

[of set up to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m02s)

[so doubt we'll need to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m06s)

[like I think it'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m10s)

[be probably fine for now okay so let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m12s)

[check if our other release made it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m16s)

[through of course one of my things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m19s)

[failed which test is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m23s)

[failing come](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m25s)

[on show to me one failed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m27s)

[test uh test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m32s)

[failed uh which test was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m36s)

[it am I the only one oh this is the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m40s)

[did any value except show minimized](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m51s)

[actual show](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m54s)

[minimized](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m57s)

[okay it gives me a bit of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h06m59s)

[pause](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m02s)

[um listbox item shows oh boy o](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m06s)

[ve o ve this guy may end up proving to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m12s)

[be slightly more problematic okay so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m15s)

[let's go back here for the moment](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m18s)

[um because I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m23s)

[think the UI test written as it stands I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m25s)

[think was pretty](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m29s)

[good it's just the zaml test bit that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m31s)

[problematic so I think we're going to do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m35s)

[is I'd like to keep it s this Windows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m39s)

[class because we aren't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m41s)

[using uh let's see so input a number](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m44s)

[greater than the maximum we go here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m47s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m51s)

[um there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m54s)

[that right so that goes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h07m58s)

[there I'm just checking all of these](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m09s)

[here so this pulls out the view model](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m11s)

[from the user control that builds that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m14s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m16s)

[so skip](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m18s)

[uh let's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m21s)

[see needs zaml test one two three or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m23s)

[later that way we can actually merge](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m28s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m31s)

[sucker because we can see in the demo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m34s)

[app it working just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m36s)

[fine uh but those changes we aren't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m39s)

[going to Stage so we would like not no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m41s)

[when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m45s)

[staged up down base](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m46s)

[would like to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m52s)

[keep yeah uh let's see these two lines I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m54s)

[don't see a reason to keep](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h08m57s)

[discard keep the rest of it let's see uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m00s)

[that's good change that's a good change](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m04s)

[these two we don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m08s)

[need that we don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m09s)

[need and then this is a good test after](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m12s)

[our small](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m17s)

[updates fixing clamping](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m18s)

[on Eric up down](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m24s)

[control](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m28s)

[uh updated UI](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m31s)

[test need](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m34s)

[newl test or it will](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m36s)

[run that'll work there we could probably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m41s)

[hack around it a little bit but yeah why](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m44s)

[okay do I have Push permission back to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m47s)

[this I think Corbin usually opens it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m48s)

[don't don't so I have to push this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m54s)

[somewhere](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m57s)

[else uh so what you do in this situation](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h09m59s)

[so the issue here is the branch we were](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m02s)

[on is on a fork that belongs to one of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m04s)

[the maintainers not me I obviously do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m08s)

[not have permission to push back to it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m11s)

[um and the funny thing is is you can get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m14s)

[permission when somebody opens opens a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m19s)

[poll request there's a little check box](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m21s)

[at the bottom of GitHub that says allow](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m23s)

[maintainers to push back to your fork](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m25s)

[it's really convenient to leave that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m27s)

[check to the maintainers right because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m29s)

[they don't have to do wacky stuff in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m31s)

[this case all I'm going to do is I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m33s)

[going to switch my Upstream to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m35s)

[mine push this Branch to my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m37s)

[Fork now I'm going to leave this commit](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m40s)

[in question because I think people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m42s)

[should get credit for the work that they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m45s)

[do it's not like I'm going to rewrite it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m47s)

[but it'll end up being then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m49s)

[Let's see we can rebase this Branch now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m53s)

[that I own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m54s)

[it Bo oh but do I want to rebase may not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h10m56s)

[want to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m00s)

[rebase how does that handle](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m02s)

[ownership look long as it leaves the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m06s)

[owner see it put me as a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m08s)

[co-author I don't really No undo I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m10s)

[want to be a I don't want to be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m14s)

[co-author on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m16s)

[this undo take me back take me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m19s)

[back do successful undo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m26s)

[successful okay get Kracken we have very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m29s)

[different definitions of what undo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m32s)

[successful looks](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m34s)

[like uh you're G to make me do something](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m35s)

[wacky aren't you fine go back](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m38s)

[um great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m43s)

[EMP uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m48s)

[I already have a temp Branch because I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m51s)

[do this way too much uh let's see delete](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m53s)

[temp clearly the old temp was really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h11m57s)

[valuable make a new temp Branch here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m00s)

[just so that we don't lose](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m02s)

[it grab this guy here so go back to the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m05s)

[branch we wanted to be on and then I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m07s)

[want to go here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m10s)

[yes now my Branch should contain and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m25s)

[you'll know no co-authors because I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m27s)

[don't like it it it'll probably still](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m30s)

[end up being a co-author when it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m32s)

[squashes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m34s)

[in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m35s)

[but then we'll go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m36s)

[here and we'll open the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m39s)

[pr let's see fix issue](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m44s)

[with uh clamping](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m48s)

[uh will it oh it's not going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h12m58s)

[to is based on well we'll go we'll go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m03s)

[link Corin on the thing here once we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m08s)

[have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m10s)

[it oh it's it's going to take a while](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m13s)

[because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m16s)

[it's is is it why is it thinking so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m19s)

[hard oh because I haven't pushed it so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m23s)

[it doesn't know where to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m25s)

[go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m31s)

[yeah Kraken you are not you are not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m34s)

[showing yourself off well](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m36s)

[tonight come on figure yourself](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m38s)

[out I think I have completely confused](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m44s)

[it okay fine](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m47s)

[okay fine Ren we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m51s)

[will we will just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h13m54s)

[jump we'll just go par and pull](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m01s)

[request](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m08s)

[uh uh let's do and for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m11s)

[the base branch](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m17s)

[we'll just go there okay so create pull](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m25s)

[request and as the maintainer I can set](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m28s)

[my milestone in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m31s)

[there enable auto merge and squash Auto](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m33s)

[merge and squash and that'll get that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m36s)

[going there okay so I go back over](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m38s)

[here go what the heck right so this guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m43s)

[here apparently](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m47s)

[failed let's look at this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m49s)

[test start with the obvious does it pass](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m52s)

[on my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h14m55s)

[machine bring on mine so which part](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m00s)

[failed list Box](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m03s)

[02:15:11,559 --> 02:15:15,119](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m05s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m12s)

[29 so assert selection selected items](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m15s)

[let's see it wants this to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m21s)

[static make you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m24s)

[static that's fine um static local](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m26s)

[functions in C just effectively mean](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m31s)

[that you can no longer capture variables](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m33s)

[from the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m36s)

[outside uh this thing I assume wants](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m36s)

[collection expression great do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m39s)

[that though 219 is what failed but I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m42s)

[guess I'm curious where I came in from](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m45s)

[196 it's here so it expected list box](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m49s)

[item 2 3 4 and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h15m52s)

[7 so it held down controll and shift did](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m01s)

[a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m05s)

[selection wonder if this thing just went](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m18s)

[too](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m20s)

[fast it feels like there's a timing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m21s)

[issue here um we should be able to also](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m23s)

[grab so on these builds when they fail](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m27s)

[it should upload screenshots assuming I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m31s)

[did it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m33s)

[correctly oh take me back to the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m34s)

[summary who](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m39s)

[whoa yeah it locked my control key](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m42s)

[because I interrupted it yeah I get it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m45s)

[test images and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m51s)

[should have screenshots app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m54s)

[test uh let's see can generate oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h16m57s)

[interesting does that one not have a oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m01s)

[it does not have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m04s)

[a recorder on it so that's that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m06s)

[another problem that we should](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m09s)

[fix uh none of these apparently have](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m12s)

[recorders on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m16s)

[them that's not a good thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m18s)

[so specifically for zaml test what that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m23s)

[means](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m26s)

[is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m27s)

[uh where's the where's the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m29s)

[sample oh man I'm I'm just finding bugs](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m31s)

[left and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m34s)

[right uh let's see fix the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m35s)

[typo apparently I copied and pasted my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m38s)

[typo multiple times why do I not see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m41s)

[I not see test recorder getting used in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m53s)

[my own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h17m56s)

[tests uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m01s)

[my oh it's an async using that's okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m25s)

[that's what I'm I'm like am I an idiot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m29s)

[like what am I doing wrong](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m32s)

[here and then down here we go recorder.](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m36s)

[suuccess](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m39s)

[and all recorder. suuccess says is made](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m40s)

[it to the end of the test you don't need](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m44s)

[to capture any](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m45s)

[screenshots but if we do this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m47s)

[this will now ensure any failures](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m51s)

[actually record screenshots with them](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m54s)

[which is kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h18m57s)

[important](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m00s)

[uh clean all of these suckers](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m04s)

[up that way if there are any](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m09s)

[problems especially with this again](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m17s)

[I can capture them the fact that it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m21s)

[passes locally strongly hints to me that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m23s)

[the issue here is timing Andor keyboard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m25s)

[state it would not Shock me to find](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m27s)

[that um because this is using pm voke to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m37s)

[trigger um keyboard events it simulates](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m40s)

[key down key up and it's very possible](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m44s)

[to have one test that just does a key](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m46s)

[down and once it has the key down it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m49s)

[then automatically uh will leave it in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m52s)

[that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m55s)

[state and there's no way to effectively](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m56s)

[fix it which is kind of annoying and I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h19m59s)

[now that I say that out loud I'm kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m02s)

[wondering if if I should just have on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m04s)

[every new app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m06s)

[start it reset keyboard input but that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m07s)

[might be wrong too I don't know I don't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m11s)

[know](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m15s)

[um go back here and go with this and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m18s)

[go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m27s)

[Ling fix uh why not in test setup and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m29s)

[clean up oh good question great question](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m32s)

[so this uh this test recorder here um is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m34s)

[responsible for capturing screenshots](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m39s)

[but it's actually cheating so in its](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m41s)

[Constructor part of how it captures](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m43s)

[screenshots is it uses the the caller](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m46s)

[member name name which is expected to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m50s)

[the unit test method so if you put it in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m53s)

[your test setup and cleanup it can't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m56s)

[access this uh the same way depending on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h20m59s)

[your test framework you can go after](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m02s)

[like your test context to figure out](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m04s)

[which test is being](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m06s)

[executed but the the the the cheater way](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m09s)

[of doing it is if I just put it in my uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m12s)

[unit test method at the beginning and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m16s)

[then a success at the end uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m18s)

[yeah yeah test context in here can grab](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m21s)

[it inside of the MS test stuff um though](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m24s)

[I often have people copy these tests](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m28s)

[into say xunit or similar where then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m30s)

[it's a slightly different way of going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m32s)

[through and grabbing it uh I've played](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m34s)

[around with the idea because you can can](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m38s)

[extend the various uh Frameworks to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m40s)

[effectively let rather than needing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m43s)

[set this up in every single test give](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m45s)

[yourself effectively you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m47s)

[know then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m49s)

[test right or something of that nature](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m51s)

[um that way you can inject it yourself](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m54s)

[and you don't need to do it I just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m56s)

[haven't gotten around to it I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h21m58s)

[that's kind of long-term what I would](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m00s)

[want](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m01s)

[is eliminate the need](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m03s)

[for uh these guys here and just rely on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m06s)

[extending the test framework so that uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m10s)

[if you use the right attribute it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m13s)

[automatically handles the test recorder](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m15s)

[bits for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m17s)

[you it's kind of it's kind kind of my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m18s)

[thinking of where I would rather It Go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m20s)

[long term because then there's there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m23s)

[lot less thinking overall and it just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m26s)

[just works out of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m29s)

[box uh oh that's why I was separating](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m31s)

[those as I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m34s)

[was fixing the spelling test there and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m36s)

[then order and then I kind of wanted to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m44s)

[look push those up let the start running](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m47s)

[again but I kind of wanted to look at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m51s)

[what the other one showed as a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m53s)

[failure come on show them to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h22m59s)

[me um this is the one that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m02s)

[kind so the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m11s)

[the yes though the the thing here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m15s)

[it's capturing screenshots so inside of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m18s)

[your inside of your test the other thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m21s)

[and it's it's not obvious because it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m23s)

[not in here but if you wanted to um just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m24s)

[grab a screenshot Midway through this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m28s)

[gives you a way of uh especially for UI](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m31s)

[tests being able to say I want to you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m33s)

[know grab a screenshot to verify you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m36s)

[know keyboard focuses here because with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m38s)

[a lot of these on a pipeline it can be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m40s)

[difficult to know understand what's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m43s)

[going on unless you can get kind of a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m44s)

[visual picture of what your UI is doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m45s)

[and so often times if you put it in your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m48s)

[test setup and cleanup you need to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m51s)

[just provides it a way of saying hey if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h23m59s)

[this test exited for any reason probably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m01s)

[indexes to to be able to go through and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m36s)

[do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m38s)

[it yeah you can always have a property](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m42s)

[in a test or Base Class yeah AB](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m44s)

[absolutely it just means that then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m46s)

[you're you're managing uh those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m47s)

[instances](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m51s)

[and at least for this I was trying to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m53s)

[not be too prescriptive on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m55s)

[usage](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m57s)

[this like on one hand this is a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h24m59s)

[purpose-built testing framework that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m02s)

[only it's only purpose in life for when](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m03s)

[I built it was to be the testing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m06s)

[framework for the material](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m08s)

[design um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m10s)

[setup and so it on one hand it has a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m14s)

[single singular use case but I'm also](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m18s)

[somewhat aware that people have hijacked](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m20s)

[it for other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m22s)

[things uh let's see dispose making](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m27s)

[screenshot isn't clean because it can be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m30s)

[uh triggered by GC uh yes and no um in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m33s)

[this case there the so this thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m37s)

[doesn't necessarily implement the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m41s)

[dispose pattern that you are thinking of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m44s)

[so there is no Destructor here so the GC](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m47s)

[won't actually trigger it and it's an i](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m49s)

[a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m52s)

[synchronous um or an i async disposable](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m53s)

[so the only way it ever gets disposed is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h25m58s)

[an await](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m00s)

[using we'll just drop that down while](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m05s)

[I'm in here while I'm in here and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m08s)

[looking at](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m10s)

[it okay the other ones that failed in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m11s)

[here oh yeah this method what I was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m15s)

[going to grab that is what I was going](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m17s)

[to grab here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m19s)

[this one concerns me because this one is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m23s)

[on start with minimize other windows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m27s)

[minimizes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m29s)

[windows you're making me question](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m36s)

[myself](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m40s)

[uh I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m48s)

[I so a moment ago I would have said no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m51s)

[but now you now you are making me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m54s)

[wonder](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h26m56s)

[uh yeah and so this this is yeah this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m08s)

[caution here if you implement async](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m12s)

[disposable but not disposable which is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m14s)

[exactly what I've done your app can](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m16s)

[potentially leak resources](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m18s)

[um and I think I think the reason for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m21s)

[that is the fact that the GC won't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m24s)

[automatically call async disposable](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m26s)

[because it assumes that most people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m28s)

[don't do what I've](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m30s)

[done which is implement it arguably](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m32s)

[incorrectly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m35s)

[um dispose](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m37s)

[method build and M both blah blah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m48s)

[blah](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m54s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h27m58s)

[uh public](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m00s)

[parameterless uh dispose method is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m02s)

[called implicitly and it await using](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m04s)

[statement its purpose is to free](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m06s)

[unmanaged resources from General cleanup](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m08s)

[and and to indicate that the finalizer](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m11s)

[if one is present need not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m13s)

[run uh free memory is because of this it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m15s)

[has a standard](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m20s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m23s)

[uh wasn't sure blah in other words the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m36s)

[yeah that says that delegates the dispos](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m55s)

[a core method that's all about](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h28m58s)

[implementing the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m00s)

[pattern that doesn't actually talk](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m02s)

[about know what we're going to test this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m17s)

[now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m19s)

[now one way to find out for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m20s)

[sure uh let's just do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m26s)

[it test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m32s)

[method look void](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m35s)

[Bo okay uh static void](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m39s)

[make](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m43s)

[stuff uh new test recorder](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m45s)

[app right so let that thing go in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m52s)

[there that guy gets built that guy gets](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m57s)

[thrown](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h29m59s)

[away make](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m01s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m05s)

[collect we're going to go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m08s)

[here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m11s)

[ask](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m14s)

[async I can't type async Tas please be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m16s)

[helpful](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m21s)

[wait ask](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m23s)

[delay make real certain and then we're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m26s)

[going to go in here and what I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m29s)

[expect what I think I know is that this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m31s)

[doesn't get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m35s)

[hit what I think I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m37s)

[know find out delay yeah well the delay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m41s)

[in here is just to make sure because the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m46s)

[garbage collector runs on a on its own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m47s)

[thread this is just to make sure it has](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m50s)

[ample time it should be more or less](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m53s)

[instant but I want to make sure I've got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h30m56s)

[ample time for it yeah this this isn't](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m00s)

[one that we're going to keep in this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m02s)

[case this food test is uh it's named Foo](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m04s)

[so I don't accidentally check it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m07s)

[in never hit my break point okay so if I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m11s)

[do wait using VAR](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m17s)

[right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m20s)

[this uh let's see I guess I need to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m22s)

[do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m26s)

[this oh I guess I I uh you have to type](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m31s)

[your syntax right if you want it to work](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m34s)

[this one](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m36s)

[here now obviously this is a a different](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m38s)

[setup and the delay is not really](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m41s)

[necessary](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m43s)

[here we're going to do one more test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m47s)

[after this is I want to set a Destructor](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m49s)

[on it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m52s)

[and sorry sorry D this is how you know](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m56s)

[that you that you're a proper developer](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h31m59s)

[if this kind of code is making you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m00s)

[twitch this one should hit my breakpoint](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m05s)

[yeah which not shocking it's in an a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m08s)

[weight using so it comes straight out of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m11s)

[here I love](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m13s)

[you uh okay so one other thing so now I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m15s)

[want to go](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m18s)

[back so that works the way I expect that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m20s)

[works the way I expect the last thing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m24s)

[that I want to do here is be real](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m26s)

[explicit and say if I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m29s)

[do yeah we're not we're no we're not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m32s)

[doing all that no no no no no no I just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m34s)

[want to confirm that I see that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m38s)

[hit but not for decades EXP](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m43s)

[because in this case I expect](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m52s)

[the the destructor to hit but not my](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m55s)

[dispos and then I feel like I can say](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h32m59s)

[with some some level of confidence](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m02s)

[that it will not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m07s)

[do the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m09s)

[thing aha so we do hit this break](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m12s)

[point they'll have the one in dispose](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m16s)

[sync which would have gotten called if](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m18s)

[this guy had been](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m20s)

[invoked it's okay I just need to drink](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m25s)

[another beer I will be okay it's okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m27s)

[we're gonna delete the code here in just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m30s)

[a second it's it's it's yes take take](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m31s)

[take a quick drink I'll down my Mountain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m35s)

[Dew we'll](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m38s)

[survive uh so yeah CarX to answer the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m41s)

[question uh yes I am now very confident](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m44s)

[that dispose a snc will not autom](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m48s)

[automatically be called by the garbage](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m49s)

[collector I think in a lot of cases it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m51s)

[does get called by the garbage collector](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m54s)

[when people actually implement](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m56s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h33m58s)

[um the dispose pattern as as it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m00s)

[intended to be done right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m03s)

[but in this case this is one of those](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m07s)

[cases where I I kind of did it wrong](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m10s)

[somewhat](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m13s)

[intentionally which is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m15s)

[uh yeah no thank you for for challenging](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m17s)

[it though like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m20s)

[that's sometimes sometimes that's a good](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m22s)

[thing I I I need to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m24s)

[uh I need to make sure that I actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m27s)

[know that I actually know what I think I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m30s)

[know like I was working with some](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m34s)

[colleagues the other day and they they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m36s)

[showed me some code and I and I told](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m39s)

[them I'm like yeah that doesn't work and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m42s)

[I I explained why why it didn't work and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m43s)

[then they ran the application and showed](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m46s)

[it to me working and I went NAB it I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m48s)

[like I hate this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m50s)

[because it's really hard for me to argue](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m52s)

[against you when you have when when you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m55s)

[have the code right in front of me and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m56s)

[it's working and I just finished telling](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h34m58s)

[you it doesn't work so it was it was a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m01s)

[nice little humbling](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m03s)

[moment uh let's see here so this gonna](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m05s)

[go through but I hate Time stuff yes yes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m08s)

[yeah in in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m12s)

[general uh in general I hate timing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m14s)

[stuff too the only time I found](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m17s)

[in my career where timing stuff was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m20s)

[completely unavoidable was when I was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m22s)

[doing some um interaction with hardware](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m25s)

[and there was legit like you sent a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m28s)

[command and you legitimately had no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m31s)

[other way to to do it but you know delay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m33s)

[check delay check delay check oh now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m37s)

[we're done right it was it's like there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m39s)

[was there was no other signal coming](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m42s)

[from in this case a stepper motor and it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m45s)

[was like I I guess like like that's that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m47s)

[I've only got a few a few signals to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m50s)

[play](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m53s)

[with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m55s)

[yeah yeah yeah looping Time stuff are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h35m57s)

[similar but things that that rely on it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m00s)

[like that that's also one of the things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m02s)

[that I I usually caution a lot on people](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m03s)

[with uh timing related things especially](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m06s)

[on tests or anything with task](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m10s)

[parallel because oftentimes what I see](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m12s)

[is people will put in the the delays or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m15s)

[similar it it works until they add some](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m17s)

[more completely unrelated tests and then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m21s)

[that starts to overwhelm the uh the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m24s)

[background worker queue and then things](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m26s)

[start taking longer it's like there's no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m29s)

[delay you can pick that you actually](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m31s)

[know will be long](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m33s)

[enough because you never know how fast](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m34s)

[the background worker uh is going to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m37s)

[able to go through and do okay I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m39s)

[this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m42s)

[one this one might just be an artifact](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m43s)

[of me picking Notepad](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m46s)

[yeah so this is stupid I think this test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m53s)

[broke because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h36m57s)

[Microsoft](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m00s)

[uh yeah this this test is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m03s)

[stupid over 60 got got over 40 years in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m08s)

[Dev](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m11s)

[dang props though and props for teaching](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m15s)

[the uh the youngans](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m18s)

[to to do things right I'm at a weird](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m21s)

[place where half the conversations I had](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m25s)

[at work today um were people calling me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m27s)

[the old guy and the other half were](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m31s)

[people calling me sunny and it was there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m33s)

[was no winning I'm somewhere between the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m35s)

[old guy in the room and the young guy in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m38s)

[the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m40s)

[room a very weird place to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m41s)

[be because as you can tell I'm not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m44s)

[60 a little under that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m47s)

[but I'm also not 20 I'm a little older](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m50s)

[than](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m53s)

[that okay so this thing here was all](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m55s)

[around just starting a process and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h37m58s)

[making sure](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m00s)

[that the the code for minimizing Windows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m02s)

[actually works](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m06s)

[properly because it's it's really just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m10s)

[here to launch something else and I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m12s)

[kind of wondering if maybe we just pick](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m14s)

[on something different in terms of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m15s)

[process](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m18s)

[what is this doing](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m21s)

[get process](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m23s)

[start wait](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m29s)

[for what is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m37s)

[this you make me feel young again](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m40s)

[thanks](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m43s)

[uh uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m47s)

[nice I'm now confused what the what the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m51s)

[heck this test was even supposed to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m53s)

[doing on start with minimize other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m55s)

[windows minimizes windows yes it's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m57s)

[supposed to minimize the other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h38m58s)

[windows like that I get right the the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m01s)

[whole test here is around making sure](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m04s)

[this property appropriately does what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m07s)

[it's supposed to do when you call start](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m09s)

[remote](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m11s)

[app that's that's its purpose in life](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m12s)

[and we process launch](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m19s)

[Notepad we wait for the notepad process](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m22s)

[to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m25s)

[launch we're basically just looking to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m29s)

[grab the notepad handle what is going on](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m32s)

[here do we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m36s)

[not okay I'm I'm](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m38s)

[curious curious where this thing is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m42s)

[where this thing is getting hung up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m44s)

[okay so notepad process refresh is there](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m52s)

[great has exited she hopefully be false](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m55s)

[great main window handle](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h39m57s)

[oh oh dang](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m02s)

[it main window handle is not useful](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m06s)

[so okay I don't think this is the right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m26s)

[answer here because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m30s)

[I I have I have a strange suspicion](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m36s)

[because I haven't looked at this test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m39s)

[since I don't know probably a year maybe](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m42s)

[more and I I think what happened](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m46s)

[happened is the notepad rewrite](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m49s)

[occurred okay no no no jump me out right](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h40m55s)

[so what was the point of doing all of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m02s)

[this return](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m05s)

[stuff oh because it's leveraging a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m09s)

[bu and then this asserts that it's not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m12s)

[going to be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m15s)

[here so I guess the question is if I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m18s)

[switch this to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m20s)

[handle right back this sucker](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m22s)

[up uh set next](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m24s)

[statement right is does](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m30s)

[this can I actually P invoke and get the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m34s)

[window](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m37s)

[placement from the process](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m38s)

[handle see I make a six digit and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m41s)

[Robotics do name that was not given to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m44s)

[me I earned it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m47s)

[yeah that actually sound what type of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m51s)

[Robotics DN if you don't mind me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m54s)

[asking yeah that's what I thought is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h41m58s)

[that's the wrong handle so we can't grab](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m01s)

[the window handle](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m04s)

[anymore that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m08s)

[disappointing um okay let's go here I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m11s)

[don't know that there's going to be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m16s)

[good way around this](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m18s)

[uh robotics in the dairy industry oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m20s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m22s)

[interesting that is very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m25s)

[interesting my wife grew up in Ohio](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m28s)

[around a lot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m31s)

[of uh dairy farms and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m33s)

[similar and it's been an area she's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m36s)

[wanted to go back to we're now West](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m38s)

[Coast United States so not a not a ton](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m40s)

[of them around here where I'm currently](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m43s)

[at but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m45s)

[we do North America okay](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m51s)

[cool that is that is a very interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h42m57s)

[thing I assume a lot of stuff related to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m00s)

[either like hurting cattle milking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m02s)

[related](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m05s)

[stuff there's been a lot of really cool](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m08s)

[demos](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m11s)

[of like especially with like the rise of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m13s)

[iot stuff all the cool things that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m15s)

[people can do I remember Microsoft](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m18s)

[showed one I remember who it was where](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m20s)

[they had](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m22s)

[put I I think it was bracelets on cows](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m23s)

[effectively to keep track of when a uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m26s)

[when a cow was about to give birth](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m31s)

[um and it was it was pretty interesting](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m37s)

[to be able to go through and do uh oh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m40s)

[Creator Inky oh yes I apologize so I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m43s)

[have unfortunately neglected my YouTube](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m46s)

[channel a little little bit um yes sign](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m48s)

[tool stuff for velop Pac should be in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m51s)

[and working so I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m54s)

[assume](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h43m57s)

[um that stream was around leveraging the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m00s)

[sign tool](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m04s)

[for uh Azure trusted signing and so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m07s)

[the uh on the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m12s)

[docks this guy here now](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m15s)

[um should now be working and there is a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m20s)

[new release of velop pack that dropped](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m23s)

[earlier](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m25s)

[today believe uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m27s)

[if I go and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m30s)

[look yeah nine hours ago so there is a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m32s)

[there's a new VPK new velop pack as of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m36s)

[nine hours ago](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m38s)

[so uh 1120 is the magical version number](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m40s)

[you're looking for um but yes that that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m43s)

[should be in and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m47s)

[and done it ended up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m49s)

[being not the version of s tool exe but](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m51s)

[the fact that it gave really bad air](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m55s)

[messages for invalid arguments um what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h44m57s)

[did it I'm trying to remember what it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m01s)

[was it was something along the lines of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m03s)

[the the way we were passing the tenant](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m05s)

[ID was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m07s)

[incorrect or or something of that nature](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m09s)

[and it it was we ended up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m12s)

[um kind of hacking our way through the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m15s)

[uh uh the dlls that sign tool loads for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m18s)

[uh trusted signing in order to track](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m22s)

[that down and get it working but uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m24s)

[these directions should be up to date uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m27s)

[there is a functional integration test](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m29s)

[that actually runs on our pipeline that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m31s)

[verifies all of this works so it'd be](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m33s)

[good to go but if you run into problems](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m35s)

[uh absolutely either log an issue or](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m39s)

[reach out on the Discord](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m41s)

[Channel yes and I apologize I I I think](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m45s)

[I've got like three or four videos](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h45m48s)

[stuff because it's kind of that nice](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m18s)

[part where like a lot of software you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m20s)

[build is kind of theoretical because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m23s)

[it's all digital and it's not real and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m24s)

[then you you pair it with something like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m27s)

[Robotics and it it instantly becomes a a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m29s)

[real thing it's it's a it's a different](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m31s)

[level of coding when you're building](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m35s)

[something with like you're writing code](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m37s)

[it's like this actually makes stuff in](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m40s)

[okay does this guy even launch and give](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m55s)

[me back](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h46m59s)

[a handle I think that's that's kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m01s)

[what I'm looking for here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m05s)

[grabbing of seen if we can actually get](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m12s)

[back a main window handle on any of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m14s)

[these things because at the end of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m16s)

[day the whole the whole idea here is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m19s)

[we're trying to reach across](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m21s)

[and verify that the code is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m23s)

[appropriately minimizing other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m26s)

[a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m38s)

[okay what can I go after that's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m40s)

[standard Windows XC I'm I'm almost](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m43s)

[tempted to to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m46s)

[because we launch with our own](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m49s)

[executable maybe I should launch](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m51s)

[that oh deian thank you very much I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m54s)

[appreciate the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h47m57s)

[sub uh what do you think about Blazer](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m00s)

[plus](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m03s)

[tar cool thank you um so I like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m04s)

[Blazer and I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m09s)

[the I should be a little careful here](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m13s)

[because I don't do a ton of web stuff](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m16s)

[but I absolutely](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m19s)

[love the things like Blazer that let a a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m21s)

[a muggle like me um kind of work my way](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m27s)

[in use the skills that I have to feel](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m32s)

[like a web developer um honestly Avalon](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m35s)

[I think is probably my pick for web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m39s)

[assembly front ends right which is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m43s)

[uh right like I realize it's it's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m47s)

[little off topic of what you were asking](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m50s)

[for but there there's a handful of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m52s)

[things Blazer Bean one avalonia Uno](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m54s)

[others that can can all output to web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m57s)

[assembly to effectively be able to run](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h48m59s)

[in the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m01s)

[browser um so it it is there and there's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m03s)

[been a number of projects](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m08s)

[that like the company I work for has](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m10s)

[done that have used Blazer we've also](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m12s)

[used Blazer hybrid um as a way of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m14s)

[uh there was at least one mobile project](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m19s)

[that we did that leveraged that uh just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m21s)

[because the team in question had a lot](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m25s)

[more web skills than like say zaml](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m27s)

[skills and so Blazer hybrid made for a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m30s)

[fairly uh useful bit and it meant that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m34s)

[they didn't have to think about a lot of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m37s)

[Maui stuff they focused almost entirely](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m38s)

[on the Blazer bits and it worked out](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m40s)

[great and it gave them components that](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m43s)

[they could share in the web and yada Y](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m45s)

[and it was it was is perfectly fine so I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m47s)

[think it is good I think the web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m51s)

[assembly stuff is one of those it feels](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m54s)

[like the next evolution of web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h49m57s)

[development but I the the thing with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m01s)

[like JavaScript and all that stuff is it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m05s)

[has a very very strong](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m08s)

[foothold um yeah Maui and Blazer are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m11s)

[better than avalonia and I could](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m14s)

[certainly see that for for certain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m15s)

[it for certain devs or certain groups I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m18s)

[think the the actual framework or Tex](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m22s)

[stack is better determined by who's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m25s)

[working on it rather than the text app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m29s)

[because there's pros and cons of of each](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m31s)

[but like the the team of ours that did](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m34s)

[the mobile app with um uh Blazer](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m36s)

[hybrid they were they were primarily web](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m40s)

[devs and so it g it it took a web dev](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m43s)

[and made made them feel like they were](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m48s)

[being very productive building a mobile](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m49s)

[application which is great right that's](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m51s)

[what you want is people feeling like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m53s)

[things seem seem like they expect and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m55s)

[work like they expect for me who likes](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h50m59s)

[his WPF his zaml I go the other](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m01s)

[direction it's like it t it takes me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m04s)

[from what is my my happy desk Toopy app](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m07s)

[feeling and makes me feel like a web dev](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m11s)

[because oh look now I can just compile](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m13s)

[and run into it so I think web assembly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m19s)

[probably move like I I think it's just](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m21s)

[going to continue to get better and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m25s)

[better and the fact that it will then](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m26s)

[allow people to uh come into web with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m28s)

[more familiar looking Frameworks um](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m32s)

[because the running joke with like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m35s)

[JavaScript Frameworks is there's a brand](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m36s)

[new one every three months and there's a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m38s)

[there are a diamond dozen there's tons](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m40s)

[of them out there you know you've got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m42s)

[your big ones your angulars your reacts](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m44s)

[uh want to say knockout that would be a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m47s)

[a bad one to get me thrown at me your](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m50s)

[views and those types of ones that you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m52s)

[know web developers work in and they](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m55s)

[love them a lot and they're](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m57s)

[great](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h51m59s)

[um but I think as web assembly gains](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m02s)

[more and more traction and it it will](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m05s)

[probably take a while for it to gain](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m07s)

[traction but in like 5 years I would not](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m11s)

[be shocked to find that web assembly is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m14s)

[more popular](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m18s)

[than uh doing things natively which I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m20s)

[mean natively gets to be weird right for](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m25s)

[a long time there was the debate about](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m27s)

[to jQuery or not to jQuery um like do do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m29s)

[you actually need you know the big](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m32s)

[heavyweight jQuery do you just write](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m34s)

[your your JavaScript uh and just do it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m36s)

[right the first time it's like well no](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m38s)

[like all that weight comes with benefits](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m41s)

[and then more and more things get built](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m43s)

[on it and it moves forward so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m45s)

[yeah I don't think there's anything](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m48s)

[wrong with blazer I think there are](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m50s)

[times at present where some people may](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m53s)

[have legitimate performance concerns](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m56s)

[about Blazer depending on how it gets](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h52m58s)

[used but I think that's more of an](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m01s)

[artifact of its age not of you know the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m04s)

[technology being bad or similar because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m08s)

[there was also a debate for a while](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m10s)

[because Microsoft put out Blazer and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m13s)

[there there was server Blazer a front](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m14s)

[end Blazer and the messaging just was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m16s)

[was bad um it got very confusing to](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m20s)

[people about what Blazer was because](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m23s)

[there was like three Blazers it's like](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m25s)

[ah stop it don't do this to me um I](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m28s)

[think they finally got that hammered out](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m30s)

[though and something that is a little](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m33s)

[more](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m35s)

[sane um I've even done a couple streams](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m36s)

[on blazer because there's a a very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m39s)

[simple](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m42s)

[app uh pointer star so we do](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m43s)

[uh scrum on a lot of our teams and so we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m49s)

[often do pointing poker and we got](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m51s)

[annoyed by the fact that most of the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m53s)

[pointing poker websites out there were](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m55s)

[either uh too slow or filled with ads](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h53m57s)

[and I got annoyed one weekend and said](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m01s)

[screw it I can build a pointing poker](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m03s)

[site really easily and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m06s)

[so right I I built a a very simple](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m09s)

[pointing poker site](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m12s)

[where everybody just comes in and you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m15s)

[know you can vote and all it it's a it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m17s)

[doesn't have a lot of features it's very](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m21s)

[simplistic but then you can just you](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m23s)

[know grab your room link and share it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m25s)

[with everybody and you're Off to the](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m26s)

[Races and it's all Blazer so](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m27s)

[specifically it's leveraging mud blazer](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m31s)

[for the UI](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m33s)

[stuff uh that's not mud Blazer that is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m38s)

[sink Fusion this is mud](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m42s)

[Blazer right because and and some of it](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m44s)

[was a as a way for me to go through and](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m47s)

[learn more Blazer stuff because I wanted](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m49s)

[to feel like I was making progress with](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m51s)

[it and mud Blazer looked cool and I was](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m55s)

[like sweet this looks pretty let's uh](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h54m57s)

[let's plug it in and see how it works](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m00s)

[and it it made a](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m02s)

[uh yeah for Blazer web app yeah exactly](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m06s)

[and so it it made a a person like me](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m10s)

[feel like I was being very productive](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m12s)

[and and built something and like we](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h55m15s)

[actually the reason why that's hard is](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h58m34s)

[I'm using protocol buffers over named](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=02h58m36s)

[what](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h05m28s)

[it's is this is execution skip non](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h05m29s)

[verion Channel LTS pulls 8 already](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h05m33s)

[installed pulls through and forwards up](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h05m38s)

[surprising that is kind of](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h06m02s)

[surprising okay well we'll let that guy](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h06m05s)

[roll I think given that it is a little](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h06m08s)

[past midnight here I might go and crash](https://youtu.be/Tv3R1L3Ct-c?t=03h06m11s)
