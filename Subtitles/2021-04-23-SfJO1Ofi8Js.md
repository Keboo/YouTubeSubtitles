[okay everyone welcome back](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m03s)

[um tonight i thought i would pick up uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m04s)

[where i left off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m07s)

[two weeks ago um playing around with uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m09s)

[win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m12s)

[and material design and xaml and just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m13s)

[seeing how much effort it's going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m14s)

[take](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m16s)

[i've gotten some feedback from people](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m17s)

[saying that this is something that might](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m18s)

[be interesting to them](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m20s)

[and so i wanted to at least start the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m22s)

[process of getting that work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m24s)

[into the main repo that way there's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m26s)

[something for people to work on and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m28s)

[build from](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m30s)

[so this is not a commitment to saying](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m30s)

[that there will be a win ui port](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m32s)

[there is no guarantee of that i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m34s)

[probably not going to guarantee it right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m37s)

[up until the moment i click the button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m38s)

[to push the nuget package](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m40s)

[so just be aware that this is not a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m41s)

[a guarantee of anything there um but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m44s)

[something that is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m47s)

[interesting and worth exploring so just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m48s)

[to just to be clear of where things are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m51s)

[at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m52s)

[and how that's going um but i did want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m53s)

[to get something in the repo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m55s)

[so that there could be something to work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m57s)

[from i know there's been a uwp](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h00m59s)

[thing that's been sitting in the repo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m01s)

[for a while never really got traction](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m02s)

[but i figured i wanted to do something](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m04s)

[kind of similar to see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m06s)

[if people were interested wanted to get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m08s)

[some traction behind this and help out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m10s)

[so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m12s)

[if if when ui is something interesting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m12s)

[to you and you want to help](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m14s)

[uh contribute to it uh please feel free](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m15s)

[hopefully after tonight](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m18s)

[the stuff is back in the main repository](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m20s)

[where everyone can see it look at it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m21s)

[play with it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m23s)

[um we'll go from there um and so if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m24s)

[there if there's enough feedback and we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m26s)

[get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m28s)

[something that at least meets some sort](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m28s)

[of kind of minimum viable product](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m29s)

[um sure why not we'll kick it out the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m32s)

[door see what happens](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m35s)

[so i just want to be aware of that part](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m36s)

[of the apprehension is anything that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m38s)

[ships](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m40s)

[i usually put myself kind of on the hook](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m41s)

[for keeping track of it and maintaining](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m42s)

[it to some degree](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m45s)

[obviously it's open source so no implied](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m46s)

[or expressed warranty or sla behind it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m49s)

[but i do i do try to make sure that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m52s)

[everything that goes out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m54s)

[um at least makes me feel good about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m55s)

[what what was built](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m58s)

[so that is where things are at um and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h01m59s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m02s)

[one second i'm gonna twist](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m04s)

[sorry i'm seeing a little corner in my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m09s)

[in my green screen and it's annoying me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m11s)

[i might have to real quick](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m13s)

[just just filter that guy down a little](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m17s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m21s)

[one more there we go boom crop that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m29s)

[okay perfect so let's let's dive back in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m33s)

[i also just for fun apparently had to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m37s)

[uh reclone my repository um because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m40s)

[something had gone wrong with my git](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m43s)

[index and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m45s)

[things were not happy so just as a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m47s)

[reminder of where we left off at let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m49s)

[fire this up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m51s)

[and we're going to go from there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m52s)

[so we had started off picking just on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m55s)

[the button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m58s)

[right we were going to go with something](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h02m59s)

[simple something straightforward that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m01s)

[was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m03s)

[easy to do right and the button is kind](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m04s)

[of the stereotypical](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m06s)

[starting point so we went with that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m08s)

[um and of course it's in the wrong spot](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m11s)

[but so we've got there is a bit of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m15s)

[and i i can't decide if i actually like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m18s)

[it or not right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m20s)

[so there's there's the speed of the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m22s)

[ripple which i i recall was part of the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m23s)

[thing right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m25s)

[um which was something to address](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m27s)

[we do have the nice little rounded](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m32s)

[corners there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m34s)

[though a little bit harder to see there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m36s)

[are it is somewhat rounded](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m42s)

[the the ripple is making it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m45s)

[difficult to tell right because the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m48s)

[ripple is not properly going away so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m50s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m52s)

[there's still work to be done on this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m52s)

[button but i think what i want to do is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m54s)

[pick this code up and bring it over into](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m57s)

[the the main library and then we can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h03m59s)

[continue work on it there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m01s)

[so this was sitting just in a local](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m02s)

[project that i i threw together](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m04s)

[and what i want to do is take the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m07s)

[the main project so let's let's before i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m10s)

[get too carried away let's create a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m13s)

[branch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m14s)

[so when ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m15s)

[experiment all right we'll just we'll](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m18s)

[throw something like that together](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m21s)

[right and so what i want to do is start](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m23s)

[with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m25s)

[this so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m27s)

[let's do a new project here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m31s)

[and this once again is going to be just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m34s)

[one more thing that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m36s)

[um adds to if people want to open up the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m39s)

[full solution it's yet](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m41s)

[one more thing you have to make sure you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m43s)

[have installed in order that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m44s)

[to compile the whole solution and this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m46s)

[is going to take it just a minute](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m48s)

[because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m50s)

[i blew away my entire repo so this is a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m51s)

[very clean very fresh repository](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m55s)

[as it were come on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h04m59s)

[last i checked add new project there we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m04s)

[go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m06s)

[thank you okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m07s)

[so i think that's probably the one i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m10s)

[want but let's let's go here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m14s)

[blank app](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m17s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m23s)

[i'm trying to decide what i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m28s)

[uh desktop app based on the win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m32s)

[three i kind of want win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m37s)

[three so that's what we're gonna](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m41s)

[build into](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m45s)

[i do wonder if i can get away without](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m56s)

[doing the packaging](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m58s)

[we'll see i don't know i don't know if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h05m59s)

[you can actually do that so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m01s)

[let's come into here um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m03s)

[oh so these we have been just keeping](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m07s)

[everything at the root](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m09s)

[uh so let's call it main demo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m11s)

[uh dot win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m14s)

[main demo dot ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m18s)

[and sure and we are going to go with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m23s)

[i i don't think that i kind of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m29s)

[i don't know if the windows 10 version](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m32s)

[is actually ultimately going to matter](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m33s)

[we might need something in it now i am](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m37s)

[curious can i get away with dropping](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m40s)

[this packaging because i don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m43s)

[actually care something in the back of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m45s)

[my mind is telling me that i wasn't able](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m47s)

[to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m48s)

[start this guy directly](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m49s)

[come on go go and find go and find your](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m52s)

[way through all of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m55s)

[oh this guy is probably unhappy because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h06m57s)

[these things likely contain yeah these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m01s)

[things contain package references](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m03s)

[and this is no bueno so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m05s)

[grab these guys and underneath my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m09s)

[solution items so we are using](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m12s)

[these guys uh centralized package minute](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m18s)

[with nougat](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m21s)

[just for those who aren't familiar with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m22s)

[it um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m24s)

[okay so microsoft](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m26s)

[elemento p](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m30s)

[yeah so we're gonna go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m33s)

[think like that and i think like that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m41s)

[which means](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m45s)

[then over here we simply drop the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m46s)

[version so now we don't have to think](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m50s)

[about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m54s)

[what version is actually installed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m55s)

[in the application right so that gets us](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h07m58s)

[to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m01s)

[there and that should hopefully make](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m01s)

[this guy figure out his dependencies is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m06s)

[my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m09s)

[thought let me just double check it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m09s)

[package reference right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m12s)

[package reference include name yeah so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m14s)

[it should be that simple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m17s)

[i'm going to unload and reload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m19s)

[unload reload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m23s)

[and hopefully it figures itself out and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m28s)

[is able to yeah it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m31s)

[restoring dependencies](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m32s)

[why are you why are you giving me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m36s)

[problems](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m39s)

[uh okay so we're going to turn those off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m44s)

[uh this version of project reunion](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m50s)

[requires winrt runtime version 1 2 or](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m54s)

[greater](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m58s)

[uh i'm sorry what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h08m59s)

[oh don't tell me you're gonna bite me on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m08s)

[that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m11s)

[oh come on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m13s)

[that's going to make me very very](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m18s)

[annoyed if you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m20s)

[don't support this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m23s)

[uh requires please update to net 506](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m33s)

[sdk or later so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m37s)

[uh or add temporary reference windows](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h09m41s)

[let's close this up uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m06s)

[install that sdk](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m11s)

[it's asking for a version that doesn't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m25s)

[exist](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m28s)

[i have to believe](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m30s)

[okay so what we are going to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m35s)

[uh well this thing was convenient enough](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m46s)

[to just give me the answer so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m48s)

[let's do this so we're gonna copy that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m51s)

[beast in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h10m54s)

[you're expecting to find a key file](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m31s)

[somewhere did the other one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m33s)

[up a directory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m38s)

[let's go up one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m42s)

[i don't really want to sign it with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m48s)

[anything i kind of just want to build it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m50s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h11m54s)

[uh where is the thingy that thinks that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m03s)

[it needs to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m06s)

[signed in the manifest](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m06s)

[no let's look at the properties](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m11s)

[why do you think i i'm i realize the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m14s)

[the um the packaged apps do need to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m18s)

[signed i just don't really want to sign](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m22s)

[this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m25s)

[can i get away without signing it is my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m27s)

[question](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m29s)

[sign assembly false will you compile](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m33s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m47s)

[it claims the nougat restore failed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m50s)

[nougat package restores failed please](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m56s)

[see airless window for detail warnings](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h12m58s)

[and errors](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m00s)

[and then there are times there are times](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m06s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m10s)

[okay so we've got a couple nullability](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m14s)

[warnings](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m16s)

[not a big deal address those later](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m17s)

[that seemed to launch okay now the big](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m23s)

[question](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m26s)

[can i just start you or do i actually](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m26s)

[need to package you i know it really](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m29s)

[wants to package it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m30s)

[yeah that's what i kind of wondered](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m36s)

[is ultimately at the end of the day i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m39s)

[think i actually have to go through the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m41s)

[packaging in order for this to work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m42s)

[which i kind of get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m44s)

[it's just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m48s)

[so let's build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m51s)

[um okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m54s)

[project needs to be deployed before we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h13m59s)

[can debug so deploy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m00s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m14s)

[come on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m16s)

[let's try that one more time](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m20s)

[okay so what is the air](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m23s)

[uh class not registered](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m27s)

[i don't really know how to proceed then](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m48s)

[part of me wonders if the reason this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m55s)

[thing is falling apart](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h14m57s)

[is due to the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m00s)

[cs prodigy bits here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m03s)

[right i'm wondering if it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m09s)

[not hip to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m13s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m14s)

[to some of the i'm wondering if one of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m19s)

[these libraries isn't loading the way it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m21s)

[expects](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m23s)

[therefore it falls over](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m24s)

[okay so let's go and look here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m32s)

[ah this is what oh this is why it was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m41s)

[wanting to sign](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m43s)

[this guy was doing it to me got it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m46s)

[okay that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m52s)

[explains it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m54s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h15m57s)

[where then is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m05s)

[so this is everything that's being](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m11s)

[specified lang version](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m12s)

[air reporting signing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m15s)

[what is in you is there anything that i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m19s)

[am](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m22s)

[worried](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m22s)

[so hang on i'm now a little confused why](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m31s)

[i didn't find the key](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m34s)

[ah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m42s)

[didn't find the key because it was up to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m46s)

[additional levels okay so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m49s)

[let's change this up then so this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m52s)

[here is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m56s)

[ultimately the problem let's go here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h16m59s)

[rather than turning off sign assembly](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m03s)

[we're going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m05s)

[just do that instead](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m09s)

[all right and then we will rebuild](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m12s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m30s)

[okay so that should be happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m39s)

[deploy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m44s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m50s)

[okay launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h17m54s)

[okay class not registered this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m00s)

[somewhat annoying especially since i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m03s)

[know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m06s)

[this is halfway working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m12s)

[so target platform might be an issue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m22s)

[so let's see here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m27s)

[this does set up some configurations](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m34s)

[is there a possibility that this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m38s)

[biting us](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m41s)

[uh this does have some configurations](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m44s)

[here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m48s)

[i am wondering](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m50s)

[let's just start uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m53s)

[just start eliminating some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h18m59s)

[possibilities](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m00s)

[right so relaunch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m02s)

[i also don't know to what level](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m10s)

[rebuild all right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m14s)

[rebuild i don't know which of these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m20s)

[things need to be rebuilt so we're just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m23s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m25s)

[go for it configuration debug](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m25s)

[x86 i do wonder if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m29s)

[that could have been biting me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m32s)

[okay so that didn't do what i expected](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m41s)

[deploy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m50s)

[that didn't get me where i was going](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h19m58s)

[uh oh so this might be a bit of a clue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m05s)

[the properties window here is just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m10s)

[blowing up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m12s)

[does that also occur if i look at it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m13s)

[over here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m16s)

[it does excellent i was worried that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m20s)

[that would have made sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m22s)

[um expected one value from configuration](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m24s)

[general output path but got](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m28s)

[six oh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m30s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m34s)

[i'm guessing that's because of this this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m38s)

[isn't quite how i wanted this to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m48s)

[going i wanted to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m49s)

[spend time building out that project and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m54s)

[not spend time](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m57s)

[futzing with this simply because it's in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h20m58s)

[the repo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m01s)

[but i do want it in the repo promo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m03s)

[grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m06s)

[grumble right just to confirm we did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m07s)

[test that this thing works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m09s)

[right yes works launches everyone's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m13s)

[happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m16s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m18s)

[still doesn't give me any useful error](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m25s)

[messages](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m29s)

[from target x86 we don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m36s)

[have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m39s)

[the only other thing i can come up with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m43s)

[is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m45s)

[so the configurations](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m48s)

[these are just for nougat packaging](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m53s)

[these are for signing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m55s)

[i wonder if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h21m58s)

[this guy is actually breaking us so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m02s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m04s)

[let's circle back here right so we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m05s)

[going to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m07s)

[this guy um does this one have any](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m08s)

[packages that matter](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m12s)

[that guy does have a package reference](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m20s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m22s)

[well let's grab both of you guys because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m27s)

[i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m30s)

[part of me is quickly wondering if the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m31s)

[centralized package management is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m34s)

[the problem but let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m36s)

[so we turn that off turn that off this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m40s)

[becomes package](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m43s)

[version right self closing tag there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m47s)

[self closing tag there come](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m52s)

[back to the deployment package drop the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m55s)

[version](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h22m58s)

[right drop the version](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m00s)

[and then rebuild that guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m07s)

[says c output window but that's not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m20s)

[really that helpful when it doesn't show](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m22s)

[it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m23s)

[yeah the design time builds are heaven](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m31s)

[having fun](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m34s)

[but okay so we rebuild](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m34s)

[that's fine finish real quick and then](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m38s)

[i'm gonna redeploy you and then i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m41s)

[you to run](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m43s)

[go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m48s)

[class not registered okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m50s)

[okay so here's my thought we put this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m53s)

[back](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m55s)

[i come up here to a property group](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h23m57s)

[and i grab my directory build props](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m00s)

[and i say this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m04s)

[becomes false right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m08s)

[because i because i'm immediately](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m15s)

[noticing that this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m17s)

[not the new sdk format bits](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m18s)

[so we're going to turn that guy off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m22s)

[because he probably wasn't working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m25s)

[anyway](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m27s)

[we're going to come over to here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m29s)

[turn that guy off right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m34s)

[this guy we need to grab our](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m38s)

[centralized package version on right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m42s)

[we need](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m44s)

[uh zero zero five](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m46s)

[oh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m53s)

[uh let's see i need 005](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h24m57s)

[and i need oh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m05s)

[same same exact thing okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m08s)

[then we rebuild you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m12s)

[okay so it does have all of those now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m26s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m30s)

[still not happy still](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m33s)

[not happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m37s)

[trying to think here what is the easiest](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m44s)

[way to try and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m46s)

[debug this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m48s)

[let's do something a little different](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h25m57s)

[so let's spin a new project because this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m01s)

[or this repo has a bunch of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m04s)

[implicit stuff in it and i don't know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m06s)

[how much of that is contributing so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m09s)

[let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m12s)

[build the project outside of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m12s)

[directory and then move it in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m14s)

[all right so we're going to go there i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m17s)

[going to put you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m20s)

[straight in my dev directory right and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m20s)

[then we're gonna still call you main](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m24s)

[uh demo when ui right we're gonna keep](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m27s)

[the naming](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m30s)

[sure defaults are great](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m32s)

[and i think that's what we'll do is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m40s)

[we'll build this outside](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m41s)

[make sure it works right and then](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m43s)

[work our way backwards](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m46s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h26m57s)

[ctrl shift b let's build this guy out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m02s)

[um so this guy is immediately blowing up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m07s)

[okay so that has nothing that bit of it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m10s)

[has nothing to do with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m14s)

[anything i have done](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m17s)

[there's no updates to any of these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m20s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m23s)

[okay so everything's on latest that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m24s)

[fine that's fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m27s)

[is it just the minimum version](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m32s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m39s)

[sorry i'm just checking to see if there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m50s)

[is anything](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m52s)

[i'm just surprised that last time file](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m57s)

[new project worked and this time it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h27m59s)

[doesn't which](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m00s)

[found conflicts between different](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m03s)

[i'm wondering if there is a difference](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m38s)

[in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m42s)

[and these ones between the one that i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m45s)

[did last time so let's just take a look](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m47s)

[all right i thought we just took](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m50s)

[defaults on them](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m51s)

[yeah that's all well and good](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h28m58s)

[this one enables no ability](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m04s)

[okay i don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m18s)

[don't immediately see a difference](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m21s)

[between these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m24s)

[but i do see that one of these reloaded](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m25s)

[its dependencies and the other one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m28s)

[didn't which](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m30s)

[is a little interesting to me so one of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m35s)

[you had a problem the other didn't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m37s)

[what would be going on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m42s)

[there's new preview just dropped 10](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m45s)

[hours ago](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m48s)

[do we install the new preview right away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m50s)

[immediately what could go wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m52s)

[right okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m55s)

[sorry just checking these values to see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h29m59s)

[if they match](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m01s)

[those are the same those are the same](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m03s)

[these things are just for what we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m07s)

[compiled which is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m10s)

[fine there doesn't appear to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m11s)

[any](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m20s)

[there doesn't appear to be any](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m23s)

[differences and yet this thing is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m24s)

[failing to restore](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m26s)

[so let's unload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m31s)

[reload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m35s)

[and i kind of want to see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m40s)

[package manager](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m45s)

[build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m49s)

[it is very interesting to me that it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h30m59s)

[squawking at this especially since so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m03s)

[the the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m05s)

[1.1 runtime](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m06s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m11s)

[includes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m19s)

[so it's almost like i launched something](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m31s)

[that loaded up a different value](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m33s)

[into my cache which the amount of things](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m35s)

[that i could have loaded into my cache](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m38s)

[is unfortunately rather large](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m39s)

[so let's try this nougat cache we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m42s)

[just going to get rid of all the ones](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m45s)

[that are giving me problems](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m46s)

[so d microsoft windows and sdk](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m49s)

[so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m52s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m52s)

[microsoft](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h31m58s)

[uh let's see oh m](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m00s)

[not w](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m03s)

[only a couple microsoft ones](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m09s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m13s)

[windows sdk netref](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m17s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m22s)

[microsoft project reunion uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m27s)

[project reunion get rid of that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m30s)

[so that would seem to imply that half my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m40s)

[problem was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m43s)

[i apparently loaded something at some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m45s)

[point which downloaded a bad](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m47s)

[thingy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m48s)

[okay so that seems to have made my life](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m52s)

[a little bit better](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h32m55s)

[no you're still finding hits](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m00s)

[where are you finding this microsoft](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m03s)

[windows sdk](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m06s)

[so this is coming down with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m10s)

[this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m13s)

[this version here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m17s)

[why](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m24s)

[i'm kind of tempted to just do win rt](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m34s)

[run time and add the nuget package in to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m37s)

[resolve the conflicts](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m39s)

[right so browse](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m42s)

[when rt runtime](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m46s)

[right uh apparently that's not a thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m49s)

[so this would mean](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h33m56s)

[this guy so let's copy this in again i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m03s)

[not happy about having to do this but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m05s)

[i'm going to do it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m07s)

[because last time it at least got us up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m09s)

[and running](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m11s)

[right so rebuild](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m13s)

[try](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m27s)

[so we're going to close and relaunch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m33s)

[this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m37s)

[uh just to see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m39s)

[we'll let that kick off a clean one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m45s)

[since i don't know how much it cashed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m46s)

[and we just blew away a bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m48s)

[out of the new get cash](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m50s)

[which is usually a great way to get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m51s)

[yourself into a broken situation](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m53s)

[okay do we build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h34m59s)

[file new project build is not supposed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m03s)

[to be hard](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m05s)

[build succeeded okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m13s)

[build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m16s)

[succeeded launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m20s)

[did note a couple things about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m29s)

[okay so that works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m33s)

[right did note](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m36s)

[something in this build thing about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m40s)

[installing project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m43s)

[reunion uh that's debug let's look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m44s)

[the build one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m48s)

[right checking whether required](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m49s)

[frameworks are installed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m50s)

[project reunion blah blah blah is not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m53s)

[currently installed not currently](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m56s)

[installed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h35m58s)

[great okay we have a running project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m01s)

[so let's pick it up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m05s)

[and move it right this is what i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m09s)

[this is what i want i want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m12s)

[copy i want to come over to my material](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m15s)

[design](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m19s)

[project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m19s)

[all right i want to probably close](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m22s)

[visual studio down before i get too](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m26s)

[carried away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m28s)

[i want to delete this folder](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m29s)

[and i would like to paste my other](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m33s)

[folder](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m36s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m38s)

[working app right we've got a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m41s)

[proof of it working outside the repo now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m45s)

[let's make it work inside the repo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m47s)

[all right so let's do relaunch this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m49s)

[that should hopefully get us working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h36m54s)

[and i think in the interest of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m02s)

[simplicity](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m03s)

[i'm probably just going to turn off some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m06s)

[of the centralized stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m08s)

[okay so we have all of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m10s)

[set a startup project right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m14s)

[build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m17s)

[start with the easy question do it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m21s)

[compile](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m34s)

[uh okay so this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m36s)

[is squawking about that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m40s)

[so let's first go through and turn off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m43s)

[centralized package management](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m47s)

[boom so this guy here becomes false](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m50s)

[right so we're going to turn that off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m53s)

[right rebuild this guy so these guys we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h37m57s)

[aren't going to use the centralized](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m01s)

[package management for we're going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m02s)

[just turn all that stuff off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m03s)

[project needs to be deployed sure deploy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m08s)

[the project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m11s)

[and then launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m17s)

[so something something has](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m26s)

[changed right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m29s)

[let's start with the obvious and assume](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m38s)

[that it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m41s)

[something inside of this property group](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m42s)

[right so we'll just comment everything](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m46s)

[out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m47s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h38m58s)

[okay so that didn't get me what i wanted](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m05s)

[rebuild what else is in here that might](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m09s)

[be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m12s)

[oh it's got this global](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m15s)

[but it does allow rolling forward you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m20s)

[know what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m23s)

[interest of simplicity we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m25s)

[empty those contents out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m30s)

[um trying to think what else is in here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m38s)

[that might be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m40s)

[directory based the fact that it works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m42s)

[in one directory fails in another is a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m45s)

[great sign that you have something](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m48s)

[directory based](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m49s)

[in here host policy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m51s)

[okay so let's stop let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h39m57s)

[clean let's rebuild](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m00s)

[well no it's clean you too clean](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m04s)

[rebuild just make sure that oh boy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m10s)

[got a lot of stuff open close](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m14s)

[down a lot of stuff okay is there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m17s)

[anything else in here that might be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m20s)

[directory based](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m22s)

[these three here clearly are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m29s)

[those are also the three that i know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m32s)

[about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m36s)

[there's nothing else inside of any of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m38s)

[these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m41s)

[that might do that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h40m42s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m01s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m04s)

[why would you fail over here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m09s)

[okay so other thing that could be doing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m17s)

[it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m20s)

[right is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m20s)

[this solution file is technically](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m24s)

[different right so if one of these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m28s)

[things is making assumptions](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m29s)

[about the solution directory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m31s)

[that could do it so let's let's fire up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m34s)

[this solution file so this should be the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m38s)

[same](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m40s)

[solution file with the same projects](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m40s)

[just living in a different directory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m45s)

[right should be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m50s)

[should be an easy win](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h41m54s)

[there were deployment errors continue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m08s)

[that's convenient](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m12s)

[deployment target local machine does not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m16s)

[support projects targeting arm 64](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m18s)

[platform](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m21s)

[that is correct oh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m25s)

[i wonder if that was set differently on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m36s)

[the other one too](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m37s)

[because this is not an arm device](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m40s)

[so it would kind of make sense that it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m44s)

[wouldn't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m47s)

[i wonder if i even see that drop down on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m49s)

[the other one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m52s)

[okay so that launches so this works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h42m57s)

[inside but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m00s)

[now i want it to work when i open this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m04s)

[solution](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m06s)

[because the ultimately the end goal is i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m10s)

[want to make a solution filter for win](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m12s)

[ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m14s)

[that's my end goal right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m15s)

[ah ha ha ha ha](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m21s)

[that oh that's dumb that's what's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m30s)

[probably inviting me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m32s)

[i dumb dumb that dumb so this drop down](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m36s)

[up here lets you change your](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m40s)

[target architecture and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m42s)

[apparently because of this thing it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m46s)

[shows you the configurations across](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m48s)

[all of your projects now with win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m51s)

[the any cpu isn't a thing right like we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m54s)

[saw in the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m57s)

[cs proj there it launches perfect okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h43m58s)

[so that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m01s)

[that ultimately was the issue okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m02s)

[so the the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m05s)

[the problem being that this drop down](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m08s)

[needs to be set according to your target](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m10s)

[platform](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m12s)

[mine wasn't right you can see the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m13s)

[uh target platforms that these guys are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m16s)

[set up on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m19s)

[here um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m20s)

[i don't think there's a way to set this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m24s)

[default i'm pretty sure it's user](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m26s)

[preference](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m27s)

[which is disappointing okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m28s)

[let's go ahead and start putting some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m31s)

[stuff back and make sure everything is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m33s)

[is happy so let's go back here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m36s)

[so a few things we're going to change so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m39s)

[global.json](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m41s)

[discard changes discard changes great](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m43s)

[we're going to delete this solution](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m46s)

[because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m49s)

[that is not a thing that we care about](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m50s)

[and then we will start we'll start](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m53s)

[putting stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m56s)

[back as we go okay so step one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h44m57s)

[launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m02s)

[make sure that okay still works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m05s)

[perfect i'm gonna just start putting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m09s)

[stuff back as we go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m11s)

[um directory build props let's turn this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m13s)

[back on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m16s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m18s)

[i think we can get away with this and i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m22s)

[think this guy still has](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m24s)

[let's put because this guy is going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m29s)

[be nested one level deeper](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m32s)

[i think we'll still allow it to sign](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m36s)

[we're just going to change this guy to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m39s)

[be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m41s)

[whack](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m44s)

[and ultimately i want to see if i can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h45m59s)

[get away with the centralized package](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m00s)

[management on top of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m02s)

[so i'm going to be picky i'm going to go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m05s)

[for gold](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m06s)

[okay so that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m11s)

[that not happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m15s)

[okay so let's get rid of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m18s)

[this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m22s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m27s)

[because this worked a minute ago but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m31s)

[that was without the directory props so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m34s)

[let's just turn](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m36s)

[signing off all right so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m36s)

[just turn that off and see how that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m46s)

[works i wonder if the signing is part of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m50s)

[what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m52s)

[is breaking it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m52s)

[so that is also breaking it so just to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h46m57s)

[confirm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m00s)

[i comment you all back out again](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m01s)

[right and then rebuild this guy it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m04s)

[should work again](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m08s)

[uh let's see here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m15s)

[let's do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m19s)

[yeah it's it's freaking out at the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m39s)

[moment because all of the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m40s)

[uh whenever i change that package lock](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m42s)

[stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m45s)

[thing goes crazy okay so it launches](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m46s)

[there so something in the directory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m48s)

[build props](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m50s)

[is causing this thing to blow up right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m51s)

[so let's do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m54s)

[let's bring this back in and let's pick](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m56s)

[on the obvious one right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h47m58s)

[so we're going to assume configuration](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m00s)

[or one of the signing settings](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m02s)

[is what's causing it because that would](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m04s)

[be the most logical](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m06s)

[so launch there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m09s)

[that would be what i would expect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m16s)

[and interesting so that is causing a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m26s)

[problem too](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m30s)

[okay so let's let's keep going](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m32s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m35s)

[those two right i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m40s)

[gonna be shocked if it's something like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m43s)

[lang version that wouldn't make a lot of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m45s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m47s)

[air report maybe](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h48m49s)

[okay so let's just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m01s)

[i mean i can't imagine copywriter](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m11s)

[company because those are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m13s)

[just for nougat packaging right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m15s)

[that would make more sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m29s)

[okay so it's that one okay so you are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m47s)

[the problem child so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m51s)

[start bringing some of this back right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m54s)

[so if i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m57s)

[undo those make sure it still works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h49m59s)

[so i'm wondering if this needs to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m04s)

[applied false on the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m06s)

[packaging one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m07s)

[that would make a lot of sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m12s)

[let's let's let's work our way backwards](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m15s)

[to it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m17s)

[okay there's that that's fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m20s)

[turn this on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m25s)

[i'm just gonna slowly add the stuff back](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m28s)

[in slowly add it in until i can confirm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m30s)

[exactly which one of these guys is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m33s)

[the problem and then we will work from](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m36s)

[there okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m39s)

[so that works let's turn configurations](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m40s)

[back on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m43s)

[all right and confirm that it really is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m45s)

[the centralized package management](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m48s)

[that's breaking this whole thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m49s)

[okay so that is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h50m56s)

[that is assuredly breaking](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m00s)

[me so if i take this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m03s)

[and i go here and i explicitly](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m06s)

[uh we don't want to put it there oh i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m11s)

[put it there last time i wonder if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m13s)

[that's what bit me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m14s)

[what if that's what bit me let's put it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m16s)

[here right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m18s)

[i'm going to set this guy to false](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m20s)

[um and i say shouldn't to put it here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m23s)

[because this one has a condition on it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m24s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m26s)

[and then we come back here and we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m30s)

[turn this guy on and we launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m34s)

[huzzah we are now working we are in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m45s)

[business](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m48s)

[finally okay so next thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m48s)

[i want to see if we can actually make](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m52s)

[this thing play nice with the other](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m53s)

[children](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m55s)

[so if we turn this back to true](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h51m57s)

[i want i should be able to delete this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m01s)

[right and delete these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m05s)

[right and it should still work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m11s)

[no it falls over](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m29s)

[okay centralized package management and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m33s)

[this is no bueno](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m37s)

[uh what is your problem here let me help](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m41s)

[you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m44s)

[unload reload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m45s)

[do your design time thing you happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h52m50s)

[back to a breaking project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m04s)

[wait a minute that's not what's supposed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m10s)

[to happen](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m12s)

[what if i should have been rebuilding](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m21s)

[before each of those steps](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m22s)

[if i'm getting a i got a false positive](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m25s)

[interesting okay so once again](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m42s)

[oh oh because i still have this turned](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m45s)

[on don't i dang it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m47s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m52s)

[i leave you commented out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m55s)

[does the problem go away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h53m59s)

[i wonder if there's some order of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m04s)

[operations going on here that gets](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m05s)

[so yeah okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m13s)

[so how about we do this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m16s)

[we'll conditionally add you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m21s)

[right so condition](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m24s)

[so if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m27s)

[so if the value is empty](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m35s)

[then set it to true right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m39s)

[see if i can get away with that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m45s)

[okay that seems to be good](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m55s)

[let's recompile this one more time wait](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h54m58s)

[wait](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m01s)

[so for those people unfamiliar with it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m02s)

[this is uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m04s)

[an ms build trick you can check the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m06s)

[state of a variable](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m08s)

[and only set it then and i don't quite](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m10s)

[recall the order of when](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m12s)

[the directory build props gets added](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m14s)

[right whether it gets put at the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m16s)

[beginning or the end because with ms](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m18s)

[build last in wins](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m20s)

[and i don't know where that one sits](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m24s)

[okay just to be absolutely confident](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m28s)

[okay so that works great right and i can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m34s)

[go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m37s)

[i can switch back to our regular wpf app](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m37s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m40s)

[fire that off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m42s)

[the fact that i have to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m45s)

[x64 or don't have to but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m48s)

[can't do anything else it's a little](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m52s)

[annoying](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m53s)

[we're gonna roll with it of course](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h55m56s)

[i'll put language parameter](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m04s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m10s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m14s)

[so this might be an interesting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m30s)

[so this seems to imply that it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m41s)

[downloading the wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m43s)

[version of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m44s)

[show me the xaml](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m48s)

[hence the compilation failure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h56m57s)

[uh let me look and see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m00s)

[i think one of these things actually has](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m03s)

[a better conditional sample](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m06s)

[oh that's why i didn't put ticks around](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m10s)

[it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m12s)

[that's probably what's wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m13s)

[because we want to check for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m16s)

[empty string so let's try that and see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m20s)

[if that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m22s)

[if that compilely better](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m24s)

[so i would hope that this guy figures](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m31s)

[out the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m33s)

[let's see packages](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m38s)

[there we go so now it's launching and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m41s)

[figuring out okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m44s)

[perfect so i can launch wpf](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m45s)

[i can launch when ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m49s)

[wait that was a little too challenging](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h57m55s)

[it's not supposed to be this hard to get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m02s)

[it to work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m03s)

[huzzah we got something running okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m05s)

[beautiful beautiful beautiful okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m09s)

[let's deal with a couple minor](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m11s)

[issues here so one this guy should be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m12s)

[declared nullable](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m15s)

[um going to rename him because i just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m20s)

[don't like the name of that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m23s)

[clean this up pun intended](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m25s)

[and did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m29s)

[make that a little cleaner so that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m36s)

[should make some of those go away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m38s)

[okay so just to confirm we didn't break](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m41s)

[anything and then we're gonna go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m43s)

[back to our original demo and we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m44s)

[gonna so the next goal](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m46s)

[is to bring forward our demo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m49s)

[right so this guy here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m53s)

[we did some stuff with right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h58m56s)

[so i want to add](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m03s)

[this to my app over here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m06s)

[so do to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m09s)

[right so we're going to do that rename](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m12s)

[you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m16s)

[like that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m18s)

[clean up all of that stuff great great](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m21s)

[great let's grab the xaml from this side](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m23s)

[right so we're gonna do something akin](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m30s)

[to this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m32s)

[and throw that away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m35s)

[and i think that's probably good](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m38s)

[okay so let's make sure we can click our](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m42s)

[button and see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m45s)

[oh this style isn't going to exist yet](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m46s)

[we'll get rid of that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m49s)

[bring the style back in a minute but for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m54s)

[now i just want to make sure we can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m56s)

[come in here and go click click click](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=00h59m58s)

[click click click click click](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m00s)

[right so that much that much works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m02s)

[perfect that's what we want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m07s)

[okay so next bit is rather than having](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m11s)

[the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m16s)

[styles well hang on before we get before](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m16s)

[we get too carried away we're going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m19s)

[make a commit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m20s)

[um getting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m22s)

[default when ui project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m25s)

[running right boom](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m29s)

[so that goes there let's see now if we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m32s)

[can spin](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m35s)

[a class library right because we showed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m36s)

[that before in our little example here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m40s)

[right we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m43s)

[we got through and got most of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m43s)

[working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m46s)

[and i would like to see if i can get the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m47s)

[rest of it working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m48s)

[that would be the goal now unfortunately](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m50s)

[there there's a tempting idea of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m52s)

[let's try and share code between the the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m55s)

[win ui and the wpf side](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m57s)

[i don't think that's going to be viable](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h00m59s)

[right i i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m01s)

[there's too many subtle differences um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m03s)

[i don't think that's going to work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m07s)

[so but we are going to new project this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m11s)

[beast](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m13s)

[and i want when ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m17s)

[so i want when ui 3](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m21s)

[right i want to build up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m25s)

[class library](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m28s)

[that's what i want next](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m31s)

[and we are going to call this material](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m35s)

[design in xaml](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m38s)

[when ui right that is that should line](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m42s)

[up with what we named the other](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m46s)

[uh no material design themes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m48s)

[right material design themes when ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h01m55s)

[good to me ship it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m02s)

[so i want to take and bring in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m06s)

[so the end goal here is i want to bring](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m09s)

[in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m12s)

[the same code that we did over on the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m12s)

[other side into this project but i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m15s)

[to look right so is this an sdk project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m17s)

[yes okay so step one can we compile it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m19s)

[before we do anything else](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m23s)

[right so it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m25s)

[it's completely flu barred right so we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m28s)

[need to go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m31s)

[back up to here but we've already kind](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m32s)

[of fought with this a little bit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m33s)

[right so we are going to turn off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m35s)

[centralized package management](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m37s)

[because for whatever reason](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m39s)

[this thing is just obnoxious](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m42s)

[right so centralized packaging](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m46s)

[management win ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m49s)

[not a thing right so this should that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m51s)

[should fix](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m54s)

[and then i'm going to unload reload](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m55s)

[because oftentimes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h02m58s)

[that kicks the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m02s)

[restore into gear](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m05s)

[right build it's an empty project with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m10s)

[nothing in it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m14s)

[of course it does okay so this guy here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m15s)

[is having the same issue that this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m18s)

[did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m19s)

[so be it we'll bring that guy down here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m20s)

[as well](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m22s)

[right not really clear what i installed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m24s)

[that broke this but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m28s)

[that should at least get that much](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m37s)

[working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m40s)

[right so perfect so that gets that guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m40s)

[to resolve](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m44s)

[everyone's back to being happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m45s)

[okay so we built an empty project huzzah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m49s)

[okay so now let's grab those files that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m53s)

[we need](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m56s)

[right so i want both of these guys](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h03m58s)

[uh open containing folder](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m01s)

[so let's see so i actually want to grab](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m05s)

[this this this and this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m06s)

[we'll make a copy of those guys](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m09s)

[jump up to my material design one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m13s)

[the win ui project and we're just gonna](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m16s)

[dump it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m18s)

[straight there i don't know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m19s)

[it's probably worth let's let's create a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m26s)

[new folder here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m29s)

[and go like this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m33s)

[all right so we're gonna move those guys](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m36s)

[underneath that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m39s)

[come over here uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m42s)

[change the namespace come over here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m45s)

[change the namespace](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m50s)

[right so those things should be fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m54s)

[uh duplicate template visual state](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h04m57s)

[attribute](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m01s)

[sorry what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m06s)

[that seems to imply that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m10s)

[you have attributes of unique](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m14s)

[which doesn't appear to be the case i am](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m17s)

[confused why](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m20s)

[that might be an issue but we'll ignore](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m23s)

[it for the moment](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m25s)

[let's check these guys here so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m27s)

[using this is incorrect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m30s)

[will you autocorrect for me no that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m33s)

[would be too easy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m36s)

[so this is going to be material design](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m37s)

[themes win ui right that should get me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m41s)

[most of what i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m45s)

[same with the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m48s)

[all right that should get me most of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m51s)

[what i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m53s)

[let's see if we can build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h05m55s)

[should be easy this code's already](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m02s)

[written and for whatever reason it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m03s)

[not happy with these attributes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m05s)

[i do not understand why](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m09s)

[the fact that it thinks those are dupes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m15s)

[okay we're gonna ignore it for the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m19s)

[moment i don't know if it's a big deal](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m21s)

[yet and right now we're just trying to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m23s)

[get this thing working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m27s)

[getting a nicely templated control will](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m29s)

[be a secondary objective](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m31s)

[okay so that's there we can actually](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m36s)

[actually clean some of that up because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m40s)

[uh c sharp nine all the things](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m41s)

[okay so that's that's there this guy is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m44s)

[now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m47s)

[built right so that's that's convenient](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m47s)

[um let's come up here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m51s)

[add project reference and i should be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h06m57s)

[able to add a reference down to the win](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m00s)

[ui project](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m01s)

[which is what we want right so that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m03s)

[that makes me happy now before](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m06s)

[these things just lived and we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m10s)

[brought](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m13s)

[in at the app.xaml right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m14s)

[yeah so we are gonna do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m18s)

[we're gonna do something akin to this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m22s)

[i think so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m26s)

[oh i guess we don't need all of that we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m30s)

[really just need these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m32s)

[but the kicker is going to be i want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m34s)

[do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m37s)

[this but i want my source to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m38s)

[elsewhere](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m40s)

[so using](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m42s)

[colon i think](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m46s)

[it's really not giving me a lot of help](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m55s)

[to work with here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m56s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h07m58s)

[i don't know how how it know to go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m03s)

[somewhere else i wonder if it follows](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m06s)

[the same](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m08s)

[pack strategy as this guy right so this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m10s)

[guy does](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m14s)

[pack urls](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m15s)

[let's let's give this a shot i i think](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m20s)

[it might work that way uh let's see so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m23s)

[rather than wpf this becomes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m26s)

[win ui and it picks](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m28s)

[up that right so same thing here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m32s)

[rather than wpf this becomes](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m36s)

[ui and it just works there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m40s)

[does that work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m43s)

[build](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m50s)

[kind of expect it to be a build failure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m52s)

[there's enough stuff in here a lot of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m55s)

[what they did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m58s)

[is uh performance improvements](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h08m59s)

[which is means a lot of this stuff can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m02s)

[get resolved at compile time which is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m06s)

[nice](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m08s)

[because most of the time you don't need](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m11s)

[it resolved at runtime](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m13s)

[uh unhandled exceptions so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m16s)

[this is more useful than the last one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m20s)

[cannot locate](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m22s)

[resource from pack](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m25s)

[xaml parsing failed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m30s)

[so how](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m35s)

[to reference that right because i don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m39s)

[know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m42s)

[what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m43s)

[what that's going to look like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m46s)

[so how do i get access to you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m49s)

[uh let's see here well let's just this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m56s)

[feels like a google](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h09m59s)

[problem when ui3](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m00s)

[reference saml from](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m04s)

[another](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m07s)

[project right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m11s)

[oh custom winner t uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m21s)

[maybe](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m28s)

[it's not quite what i'm looking for yeah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m30s)

[this is xaml islands](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m33s)

[that's not what we're looking for uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m35s)

[limitations and known issues who](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m38s)

[actually controls gallery this might be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m40s)

[oh this is both helpful and not helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m45s)

[um what is helpful is that this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m49s)

[has](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m53s)

[a library and i suspect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h10m56s)

[i'm looking for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m03s)

[might be in here theme dictionaries blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m08s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m11s)

[blah blah blah there is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m13s)

[literally not a thing in here okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m16s)

[that is not overly helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m21s)

[uh okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m24s)

[samuel controls resources i'm a little](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m35s)

[a little interested in how this thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m38s)

[works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m40s)

[i'm i'm not as familiar with these apis](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m45s)

[so this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m47s)

[definitely a stumble your way through](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m49s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h11m55s)

[so i guess while we're in here though](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m03s)

[what we can look up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m05s)

[is resource dictionary and see what the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m06s)

[sample is that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m09s)

[shows it to us uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m10s)

[let's see re-source](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m13s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m36s)

[microsoft windows i don't know which one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m41s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m44s)

[which one is it microsoft ui.xaml](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m47s)

[so i don't know which one is which this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m52s)

[one is the one i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m53s)

[so this guy here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m55s)

[i did today](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h12m59s)

[that's fine i want to see how to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m07s)

[reference it though](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m09s)

[blah blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m14s)

[key iterating](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m20s)

[xaml syntax source](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m23s)

[uh you do need to explicitly declare a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m27s)

[resource dictionary i'm going to go see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m30s)

[obviously](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m32s)

[and source otherwise you use this syntax](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m34s)

[blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m39s)

[the yeah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m41s)

[yeah that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m47s)

[i i kind of want to know source uri](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m52s)

[um okay so let's just break this down](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h13m56s)

[then if i want to be uber stupid simple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m00s)

[right it looks kind of like that i guess](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m06s)

[um what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m13s)

[is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m16s)

[that yeah the problem is i don't know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m20s)

[how to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m21s)

[i don't know how to reference the source](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m28s)

[that's what i that's what i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m31s)

[uh how about you or i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m35s)

[uh let's see the resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m40s)

[source represents blah blah blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m41s)

[can't have a key blah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m43s)

[i get it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m49s)

[this doesn't help me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h14m56s)

[but how do you know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m03s)

[oh did that work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m10s)

[really it's that simple huh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m14s)

[okay that's remarkably easy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m19s)

[okay so if that's the case](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m23s)

[right so that should launch to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m27s)

[how do it know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m34s)

[well it launched the the bigger question](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m45s)

[now is can i do my static resource](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m49s)

[right so can i get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m52s)

[right this to resolve now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m56s)

[because that's ultimately what i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h15m59s)

[looking for i want to have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m01s)

[my button auto work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m03s)

[more importantly i want to go and make](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m12s)

[an implicit style](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m14s)

[look at that we are back to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m18s)

[functional and it's in the app](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m21s)

[or in the repo okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m26s)

[so that gets me to there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m29s)

[okay we are now we are now working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m34s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m39s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m40s)

[okay this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m43s)

[makes me very very very happy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m47s)

[this gets us actually into a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m50s)

[usable state now okay so let's let's go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m54s)

[through and clean up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m57s)

[just a little bit of this so i want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h16m59s)

[create a defaults one that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m02s)

[next right that is my new](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m04s)

[my new thing so actually before we get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m08s)

[too carried away i think we can clean](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m11s)

[oh this actually did exactly what i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m14s)

[wanted](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m16s)

[so let's go and do a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m17s)

[add new item](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m21s)

[sure load your templates](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m25s)

[resource dictionary](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m31s)

[when ui 3. uh let's see so this is going](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m34s)

[to become](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m37s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m39s)

[theme defaults right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m43s)

[right wrong or indifferent this is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m46s)

[name that exists on the wpf side](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m48s)

[and so i think keeping the same](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m51s)

[will go a long way okay so what i would](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m55s)

[like to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m58s)

[is over here this guy should just have a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h17m59s)

[a list of implicit styles right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m03s)

[static](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m06s)

[target type button based on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m08s)

[static resource right material design](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m13s)

[raise button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m16s)

[right that is what we want so same with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m17s)

[and i i can't remember on the wpf side](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m21s)

[do we do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m24s)

[does ripple is it always implicit or is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m26s)

[that always](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m28s)

[explicit i think it's in generic if i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m29s)

[not mistaken](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m32s)

[so ripple is always](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m35s)

[which implicit a little wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m39s)

[so we're going to change that over here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m42s)

[because i don't like that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m45s)

[so x key](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m47s)

[material design](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m50s)

[ripple right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m54s)

[boom so we're going to change that up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m57s)

[and then on our defaults](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h18m59s)

[we're going to go boom boom and this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m01s)

[will become](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m04s)

[uh uh i want this to actually not be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m06s)

[nested i want it to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m10s)

[higher up local](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m12s)

[ripple right and this should be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m15s)

[ripple boom so that gives me that that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m21s)

[gives me that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m23s)

[that means up here in my app now i just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m24s)

[do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m27s)

[defaults right boom](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m28s)

[that should be all i need and then on my](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m31s)

[main window i can drop this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m35s)

[i can drop this hit f5 and it should](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m37s)

[just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m40s)

[load all my stuff should all just work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m40s)

[if it does we're doing a commit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m45s)

[and this will at least get that much](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m53s)

[work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h19m56s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m02s)

[xaml parsing failed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m07s)

[can you be any more specific](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m11s)

[apparently not okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m14s)

[something in the xaml parse failed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m18s)

[we don't know what but we do know it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m21s)

[here remove this qualifier so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m23s)

[start with the obvious so it got to here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m25s)

[did i mess something up in here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m33s)

[i don't think so so i think what we can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m36s)

[do is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m40s)

[if i comment both of these out right and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m40s)

[launch this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m44s)

[right it should work let's just confirm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m50s)

[that what i changed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m52s)

[here is what what did me under](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h20m56s)

[do you launch yes so this launches here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m06s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m10s)

[okay so that clearly solves that problem](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m11s)

[let's uncomment this so the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m14s)

[the logical place is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m17s)

[ripple x](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m21s)

[key x button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m24s)

[i wonder if because this guy doesn't oh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m28s)

[i bet you it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m30s)

[this guy is failing because this one](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m31s)

[needs to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m33s)

[um bring in the appropriate dictionaries](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m35s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m38s)

[so resource dictionary source uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m39s)

[oh come on really](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m45s)

[but this guy needs to bring these in so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m50s)

[that it has access to those static](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m53s)

[resources](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m55s)

[right and i bet you that's that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h21m59s)

[probably what's happening is the static](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m01s)

[resource is failing to resolve](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m03s)

[and there we go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m23s)

[that is the problem okay so like i said](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m26s)

[commit time so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m30s)

[getting resource library](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m36s)

[working with some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m39s)

[basic styles okay so we've got the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m42s)

[project set up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m45s)

[we've got](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m48s)

[now let's actually what's the upstream](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m51s)

[on this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m54s)

[setup stream origin when ui experiment](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m55s)

[sure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m58s)

[push that okay so we'll get that up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h22m58s)

[there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m01s)

[now i guess the question is what which](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m03s)

[problem do we want to address](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m05s)

[first to go after the ripple problem](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m06s)

[it's probably the biggest one to address](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m11s)

[let's go after the ripple problem i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m15s)

[guess](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m18s)

[i think that's probably the simplest](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m21s)

[yeah oop that's not what we meant to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m33s)

[open](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m37s)

[um let's so let's go back and look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m38s)

[what we've got](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m43s)

[and then i want to reorient myself](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m43s)

[with what the problem is right so we've](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m46s)

[got so there is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m49s)

[there is the issue of the focus](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m50s)

[rectangle and i don't know if we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m51s)

[if we try to address it right because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m53s)

[this button looks pretty good](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m56s)

[right we've got our kind of rounded](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h23m58s)

[corners going on which is fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m00s)

[but as soon as we click this you'll note](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m03s)

[we have we the the issue that we ran](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m07s)

[into](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m10s)

[at the end of the time before right is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m11s)

[figuring out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m13s)

[um is figuring out how to properly](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m16s)

[handle this because the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m20s)

[the structure that was done in the wpf](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m22s)

[relied on kind of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m24s)

[this end pointer events right um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m26s)

[and adjusting the the state right and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m31s)

[what we discovered before is we have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m34s)

[this problem of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m37s)

[capturing it right so here's here's the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m39s)

[note we left right we need to capture](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m42s)

[this to get the point of release event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m44s)

[but this also](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m45s)

[appears to prevent the click from](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m46s)

[propagating up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m48s)

[right so there's there's a double edged](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m50s)

[sword so if we put this in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h24m51s)

[thinking thinking thinking compiling](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m10s)

[compiling compiling](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m13s)

[come over here right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m19s)

[if we click it right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m22s)

[we can now see that we're actually](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m31s)

[getting it but it's only because we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m32s)

[capturing this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m34s)

[and so we're actually getting the the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m35s)

[released event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m38s)

[right which is which is coming into here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m40s)

[right and then this guy is doing a bunch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m43s)

[of work to know that the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m46s)

[that the pointer was either canceled](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m48s)

[capture lost or released right so that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m49s)

[that's what we are looking for um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h25m52s)

[the problem is we did this on pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m02s)

[pressed all right and so this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m06s)

[is ultimately what we need to look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m09s)

[because this resets us back to normal](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m16s)

[and then this goes us to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m18s)

[state of added](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m20s)

[i almost wonder if there's a better way](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m25s)

[of doing this where we don't need](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m27s)

[to just blindly register for this every](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m31s)

[single time](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m33s)

[right because capturing the pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m35s)

[seems](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m37s)

[seems wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m40s)

[right um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m43s)

[uh the end of a press action is not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h26m54s)

[guaranteed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m02s)

[so we actually want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m04s)

[let's dive into this guy a little bit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m07s)

[because this is i think what we were](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m09s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m10s)

[specifically the docs here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m12s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m16s)

[right so it specifically calls these out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m18s)

[now i believe](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m20s)

[highlight and press f1 should take us](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m22s)

[yes it works the way you would expect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m25s)

[all right so if you highlight an element](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m29s)

[in visual studio and hit f1](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m30s)

[it should take you to the right docs](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m32s)

[page](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m34s)

[which is exactly what we want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m40s)

[any of these interactions can produce a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m43s)

[released event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m45s)

[so we may want to take a look at this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m47s)

[handle pointer events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m48s)

[uh pointer cancel pointer capture loss](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m50s)

[don't rely](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m54s)

[on pointer pressed events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h27m55s)

[so let's take a look at this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m06s)

[uh users expect to be consistent](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m14s)

[intuitive and discoverable](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m16s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m18s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m19s)

[yeah yeah yeah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m27s)

[this is yeah yeah i get it for app](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m30s)

[developers that makes sense but we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m33s)

[legitimately building a library](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m34s)

[okay so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m37s)

[so pointer captured pointer enter](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m48s)

[pointer exited](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m52s)

[and so we were watching for which three](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h28m57s)

[here right so canceled capture](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m00s)

[lost and released and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m04s)

[cancelled capture lost released](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m09s)

[i don't think we want exited we don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m16s)

[want moved](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m18s)

[create the ui yada yada](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m26s)

[so what we are looking for is a way of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m32s)

[allowing that to handle handle pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m36s)

[events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m40s)

[uh we add the event to the event log](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m41s)

[and display the pointer details so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m46s)

[pointer pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m48s)

[so it's handling it target](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m49s)

[capture pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m53s)

[lock the pointer to the target what is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m56s)

[target here in this case](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h29m59s)

[target appears to be the rectangle in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m12s)

[question](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m16s)

[right it's probably defined up here yeah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m18s)

[so target is the black rectangle](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m22s)

[uh or i guess the stroke is black the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m25s)

[fill is red](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m28s)

[it's rgb so it's this guy here so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m30s)

[okay so given that the red rectangle is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m36s)

[capturing the pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m40s)

[and that guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m43s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m47s)

[single pointers of the first okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m56s)

[clicking the mouse button left arrow](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h30m58s)

[creates a secondary association](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m00s)

[moved event okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m11s)

[get it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m20s)

[so in our case when we did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m25s)

[capture right so this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m29s)

[is the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m33s)

[capturing it is that correct](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m36s)

[the problem is if the ripple captures](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m48s)

[the pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m50s)

[it's never going to reach the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m55s)

[appropriate](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m57s)

[control](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h31m58s)

[right because that i believe is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m03s)

[problem so even though this now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m04s)

[works in terms of the ripple getting the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m06s)

[appropriate events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m10s)

[it does not work in terms of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m11s)

[i'm not entirely clear why we have the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m20s)

[static hash set](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m22s)

[right so you'll note even though we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m25s)

[clicking and the ripple is now behaving](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m27s)

[the way we expect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m28s)

[we are not in fact getting the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m30s)

[click event to the button because this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m33s)

[guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m35s)

[has captured it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m36s)

[so i almost want to cue that differently](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m43s)

[and let](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m46s)

[is there a dispatcher or similar i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h32m57s)

[i'm wondering if i can like begin invoke](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m00s)

[my way around this problem](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m02s)

[uh dispatcher that's what i want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m05s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m10s)

[run async](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m15s)

[schedules to provide a callback on the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m20s)

[ui thread from a worker thread and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m22s)

[returns the results asynchronously](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m24s)

[um it's kind of what i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m32s)

[want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m36s)

[uh let's see because this call is not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m43s)

[awaited i suppose we can await this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m46s)

[the the big issue is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m48s)

[this is going to need to then be an](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m51s)

[async void method which is just all](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m53s)

[kinds of exciting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m56s)

[um what do you want you want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h33m58s)

[dispatcher](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m02s)

[priority so let's do this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m03s)

[give you a priority of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m08s)

[how about just normal i don't i'm not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m11s)

[familiar with these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m14s)

[so normal sounds great](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m15s)

[because i'm wondering if this will let](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m20s)

[the the click](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m22s)

[make its way all the way down before](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m23s)

[this guy actually gets captured because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m26s)

[if this gets scheduled on the ui](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m27s)

[i think the processing of the click](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m29s)

[should continue to propagate before this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m33s)

[action before this delegate can be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m36s)

[picked up](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m37s)

[that's the theory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m45s)

[uh object reference not set to the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m50s)

[instantness of an object](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m52s)

[so what exactly is null dispatcher is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m54s)

[known](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h34m58s)

[okay didn't see that one coming](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m01s)

[uh i hate doing this application](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m07s)

[current uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m12s)

[that wpf that would have a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m15s)

[uh okay so if that's not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m20s)

[a legit option](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m24s)

[uh who](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m41s)

[so that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m44s)

[okay so that is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h35m48s)

[foreign](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m08s)

[i'm somewhat tempted to automatically](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m10s)

[just not try to handle the long press on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m13s)

[this thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m16s)

[i i at least for an mvp i am somewhat](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m18s)

[inclined to go that route](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m22s)

[but what would that mean that would mean](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m26s)

[immediately firing this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m29s)

[and letting it go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m36s)

[should mean getting rid of all of these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m42s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h36m50s)

[the problem is you don't know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m02s)

[you don't know when the state transition](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m14s)

[ends](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m17s)

[right uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m18s)

[fairly confident you don't get to know](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m23s)

[that information](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m25s)

[um without putting in your own manager](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m27s)

[uh let's see so let's try just grabbing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m41s)

[these i'm just trying to see what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h37m44s)

[so that's the transitions so you could](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m03s)

[theoretically wait for those to be done](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m06s)

[current state changed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m10s)

[we could just change this up so rather](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m24s)

[than having these two](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m26s)

[separations of states it just always](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m28s)

[shows the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m31s)

[in and out and have it be a single state](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m32s)

[i just don't like that feels so wrong](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m37s)

[feels very very wrong so what makes more](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m41s)

[sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m44s)

[what makes more sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m46s)

[because it would be nice to be able to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m56s)

[get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h38m58s)

[both both events right so this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m00s)

[obviously not going to work](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m03s)

[the the issue being that this will not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m07s)

[if we look here the visual state manager](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m22s)

[here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m25s)

[we've got all these transitions right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m26s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m28s)

[that's fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m29s)

[mouse pressed mouse out right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m35s)

[and each of these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m39s)

[what's the transition times](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m48s)

[1.2 seconds 1.2 seconds](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m52s)

[0.5](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h39m58s)

[normal to mouse pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m03s)

[mouse out takes a little over a tenth of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m08s)

[a second](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m10s)

[i guess the question is what are we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m13s)

[ultimately trying to achieve](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m15s)

[we want to know when so this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m22s)

[going to be mouse specific that's the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m25s)

[problem is this was written for a mouse](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m27s)

[and in win ui we have a lot more than](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m30s)

[just mouse input](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m32s)

[so given that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m35s)

[if we have more than just mouse input](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m42s)

[does it make sense so if i'm using touch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m45s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m48s)

[and i tap on the button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m50s)

[i guess tap is the same as click](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h40m55s)

[so in either of these cases this is fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m01s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m03s)

[i basically want to know as long as i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m04s)

[being pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m08s)

[right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m10s)

[this let's just look at the events real](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m18s)

[quick do we have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m20s)

[any concept of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m22s)

[so double tap start dragging](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m26s)

[holding](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m35s)

[i'm wondering if we could leverage this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m44s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m46s)

[right let's look at what are the docs](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m48s)

[for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m51s)

[holding yeah sure fine sounds fine](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m52s)

[show me the docs on these](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h41m55s)

[touch can produce a holding action but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m03s)

[mouse devices generally](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m05s)

[can't ah](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m07s)

[right so this would occur if you were](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m22s)

[going to try to do a touch like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m24s)

[start the drag event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m26s)

[holding represents gesture pointer press](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m37s)

[is a lower level input event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m39s)

[okay](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m43s)

[let's look at this ra events and routed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m49s)

[events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m51s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m54s)

[i kind of want to know how to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h42m58s)

[observe an event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m02s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m09s)

[so this is kind of what we want right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m17s)

[we would like to we would like to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m21s)

[observe the event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m22s)

[and still okay so let's let's look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m28s)

[that because the only reason we were](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m30s)

[capturing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m32s)

[was because we wanted to get access to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m33s)

[an event so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m35s)

[add handler right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m36s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m41s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m42s)

[let's see and so we want things like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m44s)

[released uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m48s)

[pointer released event right so we want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m52s)

[that event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m54s)

[uh handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h43m56s)

[object handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m00s)

[um true](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m05s)

[i'm just wondering why that is an object](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m08s)

[and not like a delegate](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m10s)

[because i kind of want to pass it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m12s)

[let's look](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m15s)

[let's look at that handler i think it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m22s)

[supposed to be like a new routed event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m24s)

[handler instance](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m25s)

[a reference to the handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m29s)

[implementation](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m32s)

[add handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m37s)

[pointer event handler yes so it wants](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m41s)

[the delegate type for the event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m42s)

[okay so that's fine we can do that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m45s)

[um so what we want to do here is look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m48s)

[what this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m51s)

[is uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m52s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m54s)

[see uh i think we probably want a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h44m56s)

[separate instance for each call](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m00s)

[new routed event handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m03s)

[and we want to feed it end](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m07s)

[pointer event right we want to get all](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m10s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m13s)

[what is your problem](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m14s)

[routed event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m19s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m28s)

[pointer oh so this is actually](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m48s)

[pointer event handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m53s)

[there that's what that's what i was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h45m59s)

[messing up on so we want to do that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m01s)

[and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m04s)

[uh for now let's just test it this way](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m07s)

[right so we're gonna do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m11s)

[we're not gonna do any capturing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m13s)

[all right we're gonna just let that go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m16s)

[for the moment](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m18s)

[drop the async off of this guy and let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m24s)

[see if this works](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m26s)

[all right i want to basically without](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m28s)

[capturing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m30s)

[does this get me the event in wpf](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m31s)

[land it may or may not depending on who](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m35s)

[if somebody else captures right because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m38s)

[you can hijack](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m40s)

[but i don't know if i set it up this way](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m43s)

[if this will let me always observe it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m46s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h46m55s)

[no so that is not getting me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m03s)

[all the way in something else is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m06s)

[effectively](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m10s)

[grabbing this so let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m14s)

[events i don't think you will show me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m17s)

[you won't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m23s)

[uh let's see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m28s)

[visual tree](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m31s)

[give me that so i'm kind of curious](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m35s)

[uh live property explorer mount this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m40s)

[um is there like a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m44s)

[captured](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m48s)

[that's not really helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m55s)

[i was sort of hoping there was going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h47m58s)

[be like a is pointer captured or](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m00s)

[something to that effect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m02s)

[can be computed if it was is pressed is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m04s)

[pointer over that's kind of what i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m07s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m09s)

[does the ripple show](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m25s)

[ripple doesn't show any properties](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m36s)

[it's making me question this a little](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m41s)

[bit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m44s)

[the fact that these don't update is also](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m48s)

[making me question](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m50s)

[that gets me in but it's not letting me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m55s)

[have access to it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m57s)

[so i have to believe the button is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h48m59s)

[hijacking it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m01s)

[and not letting it get all the way down](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m03s)

[to the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m05s)

[that would be my working theory so we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m10s)

[can't just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m12s)

[well let's before before we say](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m16s)

[conclusively let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m19s)

[let's finish these out right let's get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m20s)

[the other two](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m22s)

[in here pointer event handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m23s)

[uh let's see pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m27s)

[uh canceled event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m30s)

[right and then](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m33s)

[pointer uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m36s)

[what was it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m42s)

[i don't know if capture lost actually](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m47s)

[makes sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m49s)

[uh the other thing that i'm wondering](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m51s)

[about is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m55s)

[in wpf land](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m56s)

[you could shoot yourself in the foot](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h49m59s)

[with this by](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m01s)

[not holding a reference to the delegate](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m03s)

[i don't think that's what's happening](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m07s)

[here but](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m09s)

[let's just make sure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m11s)

[all right so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m18s)

[let's just see if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m22s)

[that gets me anywhere](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m25s)

[closer and then we just dump](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m29s)

[foo there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m32s)

[through there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m36s)

[there all right we'll give this one more](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m39s)

[shot](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m50s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h50m57s)

[show me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m02s)

[let's take a look here and see what this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m09s)

[is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m11s)

[so nothing making it back](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m14s)

[what does the move event handler do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m22s)

[relative position](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m42s)

[so this one is probably never hitting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h51m55s)

[either](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m00s)

[because i don't think it's well let's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m02s)

[put a break point down here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m04s)

[i don't know if it's possible to hit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m06s)

[this condition](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m07s)

[right because the move is not firing for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m11s)

[outside the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m14s)

[so i can't so this is this is not really](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m25s)

[relevant](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m27s)

[so this is likely this is more like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m29s)

[a pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m33s)

[left or exited](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m38s)

[yeah so this is more like pointer exited](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m43s)

[all right so this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m47s)

[the elvis has left the building point so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m51s)

[let's go down here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m54s)

[this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h52m56s)

[so where did it go](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m00s)

[pointer exited and so i want to grab](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m03s)

[these things and i think we're just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m07s)

[gonna we can clean this up a lot i don't](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m09s)

[think i don't think we need](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m12s)

[any of this stuff right because if this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m15s)

[event fires](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m18s)

[for a given ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m19s)

[we can just right we can just change](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m24s)

[state we don't need to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m27s)

[right this makes it a little bit easier](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m32s)

[because if the mouse leaves we expect](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m39s)

[the ripple to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m41s)

[to stop rippling](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m42s)

[which is effectively what that move was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m48s)

[attempting to accomplish we can just do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m50s)

[it easier now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m51s)

[right all that code goes away because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m54s)

[the move won't trigger](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m55s)

[so it starts we move away](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h53m57s)

[right so it stays there until i move off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m01s)

[right the the problem being is that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m16s)

[so that gets us a little better i am](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m34s)

[noticing that when i press](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m37s)

[hold and move off it's not the same as](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m39s)

[if i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m42s)

[as if i do that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m51s)

[which i think that goes back to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m55s)

[handle pointer inputs](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h54m58s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m12s)

[don't really care to follow those](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m15s)

[don't really care to follow those](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m19s)

[query pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m22s)

[visual feedback right uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m40s)

[buh storyboard transition](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m44s)

[style ellipse style so what is this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m50s)

[doing here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m52s)

[right so there's a style it's on an](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m54s)

[ellipse](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m56s)

[has a storyboard has some transitions](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h55m58s)

[see and part of the issue here is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m27s)

[is i want to observe the events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m34s)

[um let's look and see do they have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m38s)

[one oh focus visual sample i would love](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m43s)

[to see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m47s)

[a focus visual sample](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m49s)

[i would love to see this because that's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m56s)

[something else to change](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m58s)

[too is that um that one around it so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h56m59s)

[what did they do here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m03s)

[just start with that so scenario](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m04s)

[visual state groups yada yada yada did](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m08s)

[some stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m11s)

[split views](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m13s)

[am i missing it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m24s)

[i don't see it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m32s)

[hyperlink button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m35s)

[probably in the scenarios custom](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m44s)

[custom focus visuals that's what i would](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m47s)

[like to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m50s)

[nothing in the setters use system vote](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m54s)

[focus visuals set this to false oh so we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h57m58s)

[can just turn it off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m01s)

[oh well that's that's remarkably easy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m04s)

[so let's go to our buttons](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m08s)

[and we're just going to turn it off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m12s)

[right and that should get rid of the big](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m15s)

[white rectangle that we've been looking](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m17s)

[at this whole time](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m19s)

[all right and we'll do it in a style](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m21s)

[setter so if somebody wants to turn it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m22s)

[back on they can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m24s)

[it's not a big deal](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m26s)

[i do want to figure out how i can](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m34s)

[observe](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m36s)

[the mouse up event on the ripple inside](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m40s)

[of a button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m43s)

[so you'll know we don't have our little](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m48s)

[white thing anymore so that's nice](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m49s)

[okay so that that was a useful sample](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m53s)

[um use our interaction mode let's look](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h58m57s)

[at the c](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m00s)

[sharp side of things uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m01s)

[scenario basic sure so what do you do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m04s)

[here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m08s)

[uh this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m10s)

[not what we were looking for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m14s)

[uh basic input this looks better](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m18s)

[c sharp uh input events pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m22s)

[properties](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m25s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m27s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m28s)

[let's do input events too let's look at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m30s)

[both of these real quick](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m33s)

[so scenario two page](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m35s)

[canvas so it's it's watching all of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m38s)

[these things](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m41s)

[on the canvas itself](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m42s)

[all right corner exit pointer released](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m46s)

[wheel changed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m49s)

[blah blah blah gift point of properties](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m51s)

[get mouse properties](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=01h59m57s)

[just fine right this is all good stuff](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m00s)

[but this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m02s)

[what i want to know is when if the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m09s)

[button is released](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m12s)

[press target](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m17s)

[pointer pressed pointer released right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m22s)

[so this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m26s)

[royal blue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m32s)

[so this is fine right but this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m38s)

[literally doing exactly what the doc](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m41s)

[said not to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m43s)

[right rely on the ones i guess this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m45s)

[isn't technically relying on it right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m48s)

[it doesn't fire you don't end up with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m51s)

[the the background being said](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m53s)

[but the problem is is we are not getting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h00m58s)

[the end events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m00s)

[what is the best way to handle that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m03s)

[so we capture the pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m13s)

[let's take a look at this what else do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m21s)

[we have access to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m23s)

[intermediate points is handled](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m25s)

[original source](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m28s)

[pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m34s)

[it's on the pointer itself](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m36s)

[and contact is in range right because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m41s)

[there is that concept of hovering](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m44s)

[um that's not going to be overly helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m52s)

[key modifiers is generated](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h01m56s)

[i don't think we care about either of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m05s)

[those](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m07s)

[and i am somewhat interested in handled](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m10s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m12s)

[let's let's check that what does edot](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m16s)

[handle look like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m19s)

[when this thing fires](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m21s)

[if we come in here click and i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m38s)

[interested in knowing what e dot handle](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m41s)

[is has it been handled no](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m43s)

[i am interested to know if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m50s)

[the so in wpf there's the concept of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m55s)

[bubbling versus tunneling and i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h02m58s)

[i'm not sure if that same thing exists](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m02s)

[here or not](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m05s)

[it doesn't really appear to right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m09s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m12s)

[typed event handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m16s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m26s)

[would be buried under the routed events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m28s)

[winner pressed event right so what is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m33s)

[um](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h03m54s)

[this is using a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m00s)

[lazy which is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m07s)

[here which is a weak lazy instance](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m10s)

[which is getting set up where](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m14s)

[must be in here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m17s)

[wave a](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m25s)

[ui element](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m30s)

[which would be this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m35s)

[okay which is fine except for this feels](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m39s)

[very recursive](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m42s)

[because if this guy gets instantiated](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m44s)

[there and this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m46s)

[just does weak dot lazy doesn't that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m49s)

[just loop me back around to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m52s)

[here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m54s)

[to know which one it is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h04m57s)

[again that's fine it just was leaving me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m02s)

[with more questions than answers](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m05s)

[so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m07s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m08s)

[come down here we can do something like](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m11s)

[pointer](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m15s)

[pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m18s)

[all right which is getting me right back](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m22s)

[into where i started](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m25s)

[so i guess that's the question right is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m27s)

[do these routed events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m30s)

[have a concept of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m31s)

[bubbling or tunneling or any of that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m37s)

[right so if i do this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m40s)

[yeah there's basically nothing on them](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h05m43s)

[which makes me wonder if it would be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m01s)

[better to change the way this thing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m03s)

[works all together](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m05s)

[rather than having the ripple rely on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m12s)

[getting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m15s)

[pointer information instead](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m17s)

[have the parent control dictate to it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m21s)

[the current state that it should be in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m24s)

[i'm wondering if that makes a little bit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m27s)

[more sense](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m29s)

[because then the button itself](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m31s)

[could track it let's look](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m35s)

[so if we did it up here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m38s)

[right the the idea would be that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m43s)

[this guy's visual states would](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m47s)

[i guess that's the question how can i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m54s)

[get the default](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m56s)

[states for the button right so i want to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h06m58s)

[go to button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m01s)

[i want to get](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m04s)

[i want to know something about his](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m09s)

[visual states](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m12s)

[so if i just do button right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m14s)

[that one right can i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m19s)

[get any information about what](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m23s)

[his default states look like so i wonder](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m29s)

[if i can do this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m31s)

[so win ui three](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m33s)

[github right in theory](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m36s)

[[Music]](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m40s)

[in theory this lives in here right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m47s)

[because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m50s)

[what i would love to see is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m52s)

[feature proposal upgrades](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h07m58s)

[source code structure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m03s)

[yes that's it's sort of helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m07s)

[but not all the way helpful](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m11s)

[common it's what i'm ultimately looking](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m17s)

[to find](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m21s)

[is where the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m22s)

[templates exist for these things](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m27s)

[is there any xaml in here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m31s)

[all right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m35s)

[proj items](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m41s)

[so how about this when ui3](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m50s)

[default control templates right if i](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m53s)

[wanted](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m57s)

[i wanted to re-template](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h08m59s)

[blank app](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m03s)

[yep this is this is fine this is how you](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m06s)

[create a control template](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m09s)

[right so define it do all of that jazz](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m10s)

[but what i'm really interested in seeing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m15s)

[is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m17s)

[is where the the actual templates](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m22s)

[live](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m25s)

[where microsoft docs](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m30s)

[this is the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m33s)

[this is the docs page for what we just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m37s)

[looked at](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m40s)

[this is that page](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m41s)

[only for c plus plus](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m45s)

[not helpful when ui3 templates](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m48s)

[this is what we want](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m52s)

[buh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h09m58s)

[let's see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h10m17s)

[this is windows template studio](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h10m29s)

[uh let's see this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h10m33s)

[that's just the issue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h10m48s)

[this doesn't there's a lot here i was](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h10m58s)

[looking for](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m02s)

[the problem is is what we're doing with](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m07s)

[this is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m09s)

[a little bit different](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m12s)

[see this is quite](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m18s)

[yeah i might have to poke around and see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m29s)

[it's not overly helpful because i am](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m33s)

[wondering if maybe the solution to this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m35s)

[problem is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m37s)

[to stop making the ripple control its](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m38s)

[own state](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m39s)

[and have its state handed down to it](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m41s)

[instead](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m44s)

[because then the button could notify the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m46s)

[ripple of what state the button was in](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m48s)

[and the ripple could just respond](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m51s)

[accordingly right the ripple would no](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m53s)

[longer need to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m54s)

[uh pay attention to things like hit](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m56s)

[testing and whatnot right it could be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h11m58s)

[completely transparent for all effective](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m01s)

[purposes and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m04s)

[it wouldn't matter anymore right because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m06s)

[right now this thing is having to be](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m10s)

[transparent simply for the case of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m12s)

[it needs to be hit test visible right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m15s)

[and if we look at the button right the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m19s)

[button has this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m22s)

[ripple and it's got this set up here and](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m23s)

[things have to flow in and out](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m26s)

[and i think that's part of the problem](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m30s)

[is it's making it increasingly](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m32s)

[difficult to know so let's let's just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m36s)

[narrow down some](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m38s)

[some bits real quick i think i'm i'm](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m39s)

[just about out of time](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m41s)

[but i am i am interested in knowing](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m43s)

[uh pointer pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m46s)

[all right so let's do that uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m50s)

[pointer released right so new event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m55s)

[handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m58s)

[all right so we'll spin a couple event](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h12m59s)

[handlers there](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m01s)

[and in both of these cases let's just](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m03s)

[dump inside right so we're going to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m06s)

[uh debug](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m10s)

[right right line](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m15s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m18s)

[button pressed right come down here we](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m21s)

[will do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m25s)

[button released](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m28s)

[right so those two guys there will exist](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m32s)

[copy that guy and let's go into the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m36s)

[ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m38s)

[right and i want to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m40s)

[not there i want to go to the handler](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m44s)

[i want to do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m47s)

[uh ripple pressed](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m52s)

[all right and then we're gonna copy this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h13m58s)

[guy and we're gonna go up here](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m00s)

[and do](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m02s)

[all right so we're gonna just gonna undo](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m08s)

[that guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m10s)

[then launch](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m15s)

[because i'm imagining what's happening](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m22s)

[is all of these events i think are](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m26s)

[bubbling](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m28s)

[well that wouldn't make sense if](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m31s)

[everything bubbled then how would i have](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m32s)

[received the press](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m40s)

[all right so let's go here we're going](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m42s)

[to take this guy](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m44s)

[clear the output window and just pin him](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m46s)

[to the bottom so we can keep an eye on](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m48s)

[him](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m49s)

[right](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m52s)

[of course we hit a break point so we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m54s)

[gonna](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m56s)

[continue](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h14m57s)

[interesting we're only getting](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m04s)

[we are only getting ripple pressed we're](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m10s)

[not getting any events](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m12s)

[from the button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m15s)

[that's unusual](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m22s)

[why would no events make it to the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m27s)

[button](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m34s)

[that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m39s)

[that's a little unusual in my mind](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m43s)

[uh let's see e dot handled](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m46s)

[all right i think we're going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m50s)

[explicitly turn that off](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m52s)

[i'm just surprised that nothing's making](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m56s)

[it up to the button level](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h15m58s)

[which is really really shocking to me](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m05s)

[so that doesn't do anything so](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m29s)

[ultimately we're still fighting the](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m31s)

[issue of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m33s)

[we're pressing well i think i'm going to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m34s)

[wrap this up for now tonight because](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m37s)

[it's getting late](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m38s)

[uh trying to](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m40s)

[get the ripple](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m43s)

[effect right and i think what what is](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m46s)

[i think what's coming from all of this](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m50s)

[is the understanding that](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m52s)

[this needs to be rethought on how it's](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m54s)

[working](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h16m58s)

[and more accurately rethought in terms](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m00s)

[of](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m03s)

[how win ui has this structure](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m04s)

[i'll have to think on that but for now](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m08s)

[i'm going to say happy coding we'll see](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m11s)

[everyone next week bye](https://youtu.be/SfJO1Ofi8Js?t=02h17m13s)
