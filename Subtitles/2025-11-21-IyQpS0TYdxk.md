[people who are unfamiliar with it. It is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m06s)

[an installer updater framework that I am](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m08s)

[uh one of the uh contributors on. So we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m11s)

[are going to get some updates done](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m15s)

[there. We'll discuss it a little bit but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m17s)

[first updates.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m19s)

[Gitcon is coming. So this is a free](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m22s)

[online conference from Git Kraken. Uh, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m25s)

[immediately love it already. Uh, there's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m28s)

[This is a completely free event, so cost](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m35s)

[you nothing to sign up. Uh, online,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m37s)

[virtual, um, at least my sessions](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m40s)

[pre-recorded. I think most of them are.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m42s)

[Um, I don't know that for a fact though.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m44s)

[Um, but they have some giveaways, uh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m46s)

[depending on what you are doing and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m50s)

[depending on who you are. There's kind](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m52s)

[of two separate days where one is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m53s)

[focused a little more on the developer](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m56s)

[builders. Um, and then uh part two is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h00m57s)

[kind of focused a little bit more on the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m01s)

[the leadership data and and delivery](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m02s)

[type thing. So not saying one is you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m05s)

[know developers and the other one's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m07s)

[leadership but that's kind of how things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m08s)

[are broken down a little bit. Um if you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m10s)

[are interested. So day one building](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m12s)

[there the ship smarter not harder beyond](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m15s)

[commit with all of the practical getit](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m18s)

[kraken workflows. I was really excited](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m20s)

[to put this one on. I hopefully it comes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m22s)

[through. I I felt like I had to rush it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m26s)

[because I was on a time limit for how uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m28s)

[long I could go. So, if I'm talking a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m30s)

[little fast during it, just know I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m32s)

[watching a clock trying to keep it uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m34s)

[under the max time that I was given. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m36s)

[but I was really happy with uh the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m39s)

[demos. I think I hit every single](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m42s)

[awesome AI feature in Get Kraken, plus](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m44s)

[cloud patches, work trees, and kind of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m47s)

[some of the stuff that maybe we'll we'll](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m50s)

[see a little bit of being done tonight.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m52s)

[Um, I was also building an app while](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m54s)

[using set app for the presentation. It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m57s)

[was just inception level awesome. I was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h01m59s)

[tickled to death. I came away really](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m01s)

[excited about it. So, if you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m03s)

[interested, uh, gitcon.com](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m04s)

[has all the happiness. Let me drop that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m07s)

[in. Um, and definitely register. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m11s)

[it is going to be well worth it. Next](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m15s)

[thing coming up, uh, Spokane.net user](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m18s)

[group. Once again, hey, look me. Um, if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m21s)

[you are not sick of me, Izzy, merry](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m24s)

[Christmas. You're up early today. Good](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m26s)

[to have you. Um, this is a talk on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m28s)

[everything.net 10 C14. So, there is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m33s)

[ton of cool stuff that all got released](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m37s)

[and launched. Um, I've been putting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m40s)

[together kind of my itinerary for it and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m42s)

[there's more content than I have hours.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m46s)

[So, we're going to be busting through](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m48s)

[what I think are the the biggest, most](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m51s)

[um important announcements. Um, I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m54s)

[trying to bias it towards the things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m57s)

[that are going to have the broadest](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h02m58s)

[applicable audience um because there's a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m00s)

[lot there. Um, the C stuff is cool. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m03s)

[.NET 10 stuff is cool, but there's also](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m06s)

[Aspire, EF,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m08s)

[um, all kinds of stuff. And I might even](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m10s)

[throw in some VS 2026. Like this year,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m13s)

[Microsoft dumped a whole bunch of stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m16s)

[on us all at once. Like we got all the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m18s)

[things revving this year, which was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m22s)

[cool. Lots of neat stuff. Um, so if you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m24s)

[are interested, this is a hybrid event](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m27s)

[both in person and online. if you are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m29s)

[interested. Um the if the time slot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m31s)

[doesn't work for you, i.e. someone like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m35s)

[Izzy, who I know, uh 5:00 PM Pacific is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m36s)

[hopefully sleeping hours for sane](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m40s)

[individuals, um it will be up on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m42s)

[Intellletch's YouTube channel. Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m45s)

[sometime within like a few days](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m49s)

[afterwards. So in single digits of days](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m52s)

[of December, it will probably be be live](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m55s)

[if you want to catch the recording as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m57s)

[well. um if you can't do it live. Um and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h03m59s)

[you can always find me here if you have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m02s)

[follow-up questions. That's the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m03s)

[disappointing part about doing it uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m04s)

[from the recording is you don't have as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m07s)

[many opportunities to ask questions, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m09s)

[if you're watching this stream, you know](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m10s)

[where to find me. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m12s)

[there's that. Uh let's see. Need extra](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m15s)

[time to unload and de ice the car today.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m19s)

[Oh, don't do that, Izzy. Uh did a career](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m20s)

[talk yesterday and showed off the Enigma](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m23s)

[bits and some 3D prints. Awesome. That](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m25s)

[is very cool. I started playing around](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m28s)

[with different 3D tools to see what what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m30s)

[I could do. So I I was um GDAU Go dot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m35s)

[and Unity I started playing with just a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m40s)

[bit just to try to get my I wanted to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m42s)

[try to get a little bit of a handle of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m44s)

[what's possible with each just just to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m45s)

[see um because I I wanted to try to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m49s)

[learn. I don't I didn't get very far. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m52s)

[was kind of just going through some of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m54s)

[the getting started tutorials, but I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m55s)

[figured I want to at least do that much](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m57s)

[so I so I make a good decision. We may](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h04m58s)

[end up back at that very first library](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m01s)

[you you sent to me. I don't know. We're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m04s)

[again I'm trying to I'm trying to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m06s)

[understand it so I can do a good thing,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m07s)

[but we will circle back to that Enigma](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m10s)

[stuff. Um, okay. So, couple things. One](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m11s)

[of the things that happened](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m17s)

[on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m19s)

[umn](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m21s)

[net comp time frame or at least it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m23s)

[happened that week. I don't know if it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m25s)

[was intended to be launched then system](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m26s)

[command line. Some of you who have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m28s)

[watched this channel for a very long](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m30s)

[time know that I was involved in that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m31s)

[for many years. Um there was a bunch of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m34s)

[stuff that happened at Microsoft](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m37s)

[especially during layoffs and shuffling](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m39s)

[and rep prioritizing all this stuff. It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m41s)

[kind of felt like it was abandoned a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m43s)

[little bit. However, however, let me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m46s)

[because one of the biggest complaints](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m52s)

[about it was, "You've not g it. You've](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m54s)

[not g it. It's been in preview here for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m56s)

[years. When are you going to G8?" Well,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h05m58s)

[guess what?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m00s)

[I have an answer now. We skipped 1.0 and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m03s)

[went straight to 2.0.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m06s)

[I haven't been involved in it the last](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m09s)

[few months. I can't speak to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m10s)

[rationale behind that, but the important](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m12s)

[part here is it is gone GA. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m14s)

[awesome. So, uh, this is now out. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m19s)

[apparently they don't put their Nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m23s)

[package as part of their artifacts, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m25s)

[it is out on nougat.org. We can now pull](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m26s)

[this in. Like look, look, it's me.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m29s)

[Yay. Um, so yeah, I've done a little bit](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m34s)

[of on on this project and so hopefully](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m38s)

[this um gives people some asurances that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m40s)

[it is now a full thing. It's a real boy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m44s)

[It is a GA project. Have at it. Start](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m47s)

[having fun. So Velopac has been sitting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m50s)

[on the preview bits for ages. That was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m54s)

[one of the things that got me going. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h06m58s)

[I won't say that it has been a great](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m00s)

[experience. like there's been a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m02s)

[stuff going on here. So, I want to dive](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m04s)

[in um because I turned C-Pilot loose on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m06s)

[doing the update and now we have to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m10s)

[actually like make it real. So, I let it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m12s)

[go through and rev the package and start](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m15s)

[updating the code so it can do quite a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m17s)

[bit of it. Um, one of the demos I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m19s)

[actually considered for Gitcon was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m22s)

[actually revving a different library I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m24s)

[have on the system command line because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m25s)

[copilot knew quite a bit in terms of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m27s)

[what the refactors needed to be um, and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m31s)

[worked its way through quite a bit of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m34s)

[the rename. So the biggest thing here if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m36s)

[you are looking to change your system](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m38s)

[command line reference there was some um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m40s)

[back and forth in the library where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m45s)

[there was a lot of debate between](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m47s)

[whether something could be called option](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m49s)

[or whether it needed a CLI prefix of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m52s)

[option and this was a big debate between](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m54s)

[the umn net review board because there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h07m57s)

[was talk of potentially trying to get it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m01s)

[uh bclified and all of that jazz. um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m03s)

[which didn't happen but the after a lot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m06s)

[of discussion it was decided that we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m10s)

[needed the CLI prefix this then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m12s)

[necessitated a whole bunch of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m14s)

[refactoring well a lot of that got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m16s)

[rolled back to a much more stable state](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m17s)

[where and I kind of like just the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m21s)

[regular name the the argument against it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m23s)

[was well options too common there's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m25s)

[going to be other things where options](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m27s)

[exist like I option is another you know](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m29s)

[common net type but once this thing was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m32s)

[agreed to ship as a nougat. I assume](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m35s)

[that that prefix argument kind of died a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m37s)

[little bit on site. So, one second. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m40s)

[got a foot here a little bit. I got foot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m42s)

[pedal. I found one of my very first](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m45s)

[soldering projects](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m49s)

[where I disassembled a just a standard](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h08m51s)

[real easily accessible and I just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m05s)

[soldered wires onto the pins to line up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m07s)

[with whatever keys I wanted. So I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m10s)

[literally have a foot pedal to be my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m12s)

[control key. So yes, when you see me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m13s)

[struggling for copy and paste or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m15s)

[otherwise, yes, it's now so that I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m17s)

[have to use my pinky, that's the level](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m19s)

[of laziness that we are talking about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m21s)

[here. Okay, so control shift E. We're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m23s)

[going to cut pop Visual Studio. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m26s)

[installed the latest preview right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m27s)

[before this stream because why not? We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m30s)

[we got to do all the the updates because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m33s)

[I haven't been sitting at this machine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m35s)

[for the last two days. So I I didn't get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m37s)

[Tuesday's update. Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m42s)

[CMake support with this workspace. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m47s)

[don't think I want actually to do that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m49s)

[because the CMake stuff is for the Rust](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m51s)

[bits and for this we are just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m53s)

[be focused on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m56s)

[the VPK CLI tool. So that is that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h09m58s)

[what we are going to be focused on. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m02s)

[let's just set our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m04s)

[set our startup project there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m06s)

[Um, and then what is targeting net six?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m10s)

[So, we may we may have a handful of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m13s)

[things to go through and rev and do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m15s)

[Okay, I'm going to ignore the build one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m17s)

[because that's the other thing I want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m20s)

[go and address is I want to get the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m21s)

[Velopac build project up and and ready](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m24s)

[to go. So, but this one here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m28s)

[um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m33s)

[we're going to just drop net six out of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m36s)

[the list.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m37s)

[because that is likely not relevant.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m39s)

[There we go. Okay, so we're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m43s)

[ignore the other error and then let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m46s)

[just build this and I want to go through](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m47s)

[and double check and make sure](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m49s)

[this thing continues to run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m52s)

[appropriately. I don't know how well](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m53s)

[we've got tests over this area because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m55s)

[this is a CLI app. We've got tests over](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h10m58s)

[the code that it invokes, but I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m00s)

[think we have tests over the CLI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m03s)

[invocation itself.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m05s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m07s)

[uh, and if it looks like your eyes are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m12s)

[blinking really fast, that's your new AI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m14s)

[powered face recognition to swap camera](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m16s)

[view modes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m17s)

[That would be cool. No, that's more](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m20s)

[likely, uh, hopefully it doesn't look](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m21s)

[like that,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m24s)

[but it would it would be cool. I I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m26s)

[will say I have I have both been loving](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m29s)

[and hating AI based coding recently.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m33s)

[Like there are days co-pilot just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m36s)

[impresses me with what it's able to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m37s)

[and then like two days ago while](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m40s)

[refactoring some C# code in a file that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m43s)

[was unrelated to what it was working on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m45s)

[it swapped out an open PN for a period.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m47s)

[Now shockingly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m50s)

[that's not possible to do in C# and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m52s)

[still have it compile. So uh yeah that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m54s)

[that didn't work. those like uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m56s)

[co-pilot. No, I don't what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h11m59s)

[I don't know what you've Yeah, I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m03s)

[know how you got yourself wrapped around](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m05s)

[the axle on that one. Okay, so this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m06s)

[actually just built. So that's that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m08s)

[kind of exciting to me. Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m11s)

[I just want to check what this ended up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m15s)

[being because it looks like a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m17s)

[these are just literal white space on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m18s)

[the end of these files. So, we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m21s)

[to go through and I just want to I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m23s)

[going to back Sorry, I'm going to back](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m26s)

[my zoom level up. I'm sorry. I need to I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m27s)

[need to be able to see a little bit](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m29s)

[better here. Um, let's just go path and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m30s)

[we'll do these one at a time. So, this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m33s)

[one I need to keep. This is just whites](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m35s)

[space. We're going to discard. I don't I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m38s)

[don't want a bunch of stuff with just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m40s)

[it. Like I realize the the new line at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m41s)

[the end is what the formatter wants, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m43s)

[I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m45s)

[I want to do this without like this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m47s)

[already going to be an annoying change](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m50s)

[for Kaylin to review. So I don't want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m52s)

[make his life any harder than it needs](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m54s)

[to be. So we're going to just keep it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m56s)

[simple, straightforward,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h12m59s)

[and get this thing ready to rock. and he](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m02s)

[may end up wanting to block it until](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m04s)

[after the MSI stuff merges because there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m06s)

[are CLI changes on the MSI branch as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m08s)

[well. So, this is this is pretty much](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m11s)

[guaranteed to cause conflicts,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m14s)

[which is the name of the game, but I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m17s)

[think the conflicts are going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m20s)

[simple enough where AI resolution](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m21s)

[uh that's a Linux thing to have a new](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m25s)

[line before eof. Um, I think in this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m28s)

[case it's actually something we put in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m31s)

[our editor config, but we don't ever run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m33s)

[a full dot like like this one here for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m36s)

[example, right? Like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m39s)

[there's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m41s)

[and I'll see if I can do this right.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m42s)

[Like it added this new line here, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m44s)

[there was already a blank line. Like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m48s)

[it's kind of like So I think this was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m50s)

[co-pilot trying to be helpful um and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m53s)

[being stupid. Um, but I am aware that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m56s)

[we've got some formatting stuff in our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h13m59s)

[editor config. So, it would not shock me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m01s)

[to find that it messed messed things up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m03s)

[a little bit. So, I'm just going to keep](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m06s)

[resetting these ones that are all just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m08s)

[trailing new lines because these are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m11s)

[probably not overly relevant. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m12s)

[why with AI coding, you should always](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m15s)

[review its work. Watch it like a hawk](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m18s)

[because it will it will do things and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m21s)

[not always good things. Okay, so these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m24s)

[this one is obviously something worth](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m26s)

[reviewing, something worth reviewing,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m28s)

[not worth reviewing. So that's that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m30s)

[basically what we're doing is worth](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m32s)

[review, not worth review, and then we'll](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m34s)

[go through and check it because that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m36s)

[that is what we want.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m39s)

[I am](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m42s)

[I wonder if there's an easy way.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m44s)

[I wonder if I recompose commits if Git](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m47s)

[Kraken's AI would do this for me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m50s)

[because it it oftentimes groups like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m54s)

[changes together.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m57s)

[Uh let's see. I'm going to just uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h14m59s)

[well, we're going to we're going to keep](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m05s)

[it because there's an actual functional](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m06s)

[change in there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m08s)

[Yep. Those are just type name changes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m12s)

[Type name changes. Okay. Now we've got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m14s)

[Now we've got legitimate stuff in here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m18s)

[Net format plus editor config. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m21s)

[And that is it's one of those I need to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m24s)

[apply it down at this level and just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m27s)

[rerun it because I'm not confident in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m29s)

[our setup for it because we do have our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m32s)

[editor config set, but I also know that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m34s)

[it's a little dated. Um CLI options.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m36s)

[See, I undid something that I shouldn't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m39s)

[have undone.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m40s)

[I missed one of them. That's fine. Easy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m42s)

[fix. Easy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m45s)

[fix. Okay. And then I want to look and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m47s)

[see what I've got for tests though](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m49s)

[because I don't think I have a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m53s)

[CLI parsing test. But maybe I do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h15m59s)

[Uh let's see. Options mapper tests.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m03s)

[Okay. So we've got a handful of these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m07s)

[things in here that are good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m09s)

[Um, but we do not have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m13s)

[great coverage on all of these.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m17s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m20s)

[let's at least run these tests and make](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m22s)

[sure we're good to go there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m24s)

[We'll run those ones](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m27s)

[because this will at least guarantee a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m33s)

[minimum level of functionality is good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m34s)

[Okay, so that that much that much isn't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m38s)

[bad. Um, and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m40s)

[I'm trying to decide if I want it to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m46s)

[more or not.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m48s)

[What What are we actually testing here?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m53s)

[parse result](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h16m55s)

[a necessary assignment of parse result](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m00s)

[because this is actually not overly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m08s)

[relevant to what it's doing. It's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m10s)

[parsing the CLI but then not asserting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m12s)

[anything of value on the actual parsed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m14s)

[result. But I was wondering if we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m17s)

[going to run into this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m19s)

[folder with path parses value because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m27s)

[these are just the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m29s)

[derived ones from the base ones. Uh I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m31s)

[on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m35s)

[you are on line 22. Yeah, the so this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m37s)

[one up here is doing the parse results.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m40s)

[it up and I think Kayn did this cuz I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m48s)

[don't recognize it. Could have been me,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m50s)

[but I don't think it was. Um, this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m52s)

[abstract is the base for both the Azure](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m55s)

[download and the Azure upload. And then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h17m58s)

[it's just testing these ones here. But](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m00s)

[really, it's just validating the prefix](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m03s)

[of the command.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m05s)

[Oh, I guess without this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m09s)

[Get required default options.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m14s)

[Well, the easiest thing to do is just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m17s)

[torch it and see what happens. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m18s)

[because of how this is being parsed. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m20s)

[th this is one of the things that Kalin](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m24s)

[restructured on the CLI stuff just to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m27s)

[make sure it was all working is to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m29s)

[ensure that these ones actually parse](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m31s)

[correctly. So, I think what I'm going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m33s)

[do instead is I'm just going to do an](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m34s)

[underscore as a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m37s)

[as a way to make sure that it's clear](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m39s)

[that hey, we are just not parsing these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m41s)

[ones all the way through. Um, trying to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m43s)

[decide if it's worth adding in the extra](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m46s)

[because we could turn this sucker loose](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m50s)

[on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m53s)

[doing quite a bit.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m55s)

[I could let co-pilot actually add a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h18m58s)

[bunch in for me.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m01s)

[I'm not sure if I want that or not. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m04s)

[don't know that I do. I think what we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m06s)

[going to do is we're going to send this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m09s)

[as is pack command test. Oh, we never](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m10s)

[even implemented this because this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m14s)

[OSX,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m15s)

[which I will say is a limiting factor](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m19s)

[for me because I don't have a Mac. So, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m21s)

[do rely heavily on Kalin to do all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m24s)

[the OSX testing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m28s)

[Um, let's see. So assert true. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m31s)

[one in an assert equals.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m34s)

[That way you get a much better thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m36s)

[What are you?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m40s)

[Oh yeah, and it's and this is why you do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m42s)

[assert equals so that the analyzer can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m44s)

[flag you when you get expected and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m46s)

[actual wrong.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m48s)

[That's what you want there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m50s)

[There we go. That's better.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m53s)

[Boom.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h19m57s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m00s)

[Okay. So, I think this is probably good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m02s)

[I'm going to commit this after I make](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m05s)

[sure that this much runs and then we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m07s)

[going to jump on to the other side of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m09s)

[the fence because the other side is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m10s)

[and the other side I mean the build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m13s)

[package is the one that most interests](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m14s)

[me and get this thing going. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m16s)

[stage all changes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m20s)

[Grab that. go back to tree mode because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m23s)

[I like to be able to collapse these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m25s)

[things to see them in this manner.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m27s)

[And then we'll we'll see if we want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m29s)

[uh let's see um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m32s)

[DA2](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m39s)

[release. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m42s)

[Move that onto a new line.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m46s)

[Do a little bigger so I can see it all.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m48s)

[Let's just let's uh you did okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m51s)

[magical AI. Okay, great. Commit,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h20m55s)

[push, and submit. And then we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m01s)

[to jump back to my other work tree. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m04s)

[then here, I want to jump onto the build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m07s)

[project update. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m09s)

[which means I close this instance of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m12s)

[Visual Studio and grab](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m15s)

[Oh.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m18s)

[My Visual Studio installer is wanting to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m23s)

[think about doing something and I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m25s)

[wanting to see what it's wanting to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m26s)

[Oh, it's apparently going to go and push](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m29s)

[an update on me. Lovely. I must have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m31s)

[clicked a button and not realized I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m33s)

[hadn't run it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m34s)

[Okay. Well, while this guy's thinking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m37s)

[about what he's doing, just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m38s)

[launch into VS Code and I can continue](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m42s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m45s)

[We can code in two situations. Here we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m47s)

[go. Give me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m50s)

[clear that out. So, what we are doing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m53s)

[here is the I'm going to move my head to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m56s)

[the right for a moment. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h21m59s)

[the project here, at least underneath](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m04s)

[the solution as Oh, shut up. I I know](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m06s)

[you're you're busy restoring all the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m09s)

[things. Go have fun.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m11s)

[There are several different things that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m13s)

[make up Velopac in and of itself. There](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m18s)

[is a client library which is what you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m20s)

[end up referencing inside of your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m23s)

[application which has we've got various](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m26s)

[language supports like you can see C++,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m28s)

[C#, Node, Python, etc. There's the VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m30s)

[CLI tool which is the net global tool,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m34s)

[which now if you haven't seen it,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m37s)

[um I just updated the docs the other](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m40s)

[night. Uh let's see here. I showed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m42s)

[I think it's in the getting started one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m48s)

[Um when you go to run,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m53s)

[when you go to run the global tool, you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m55s)

[can actually use the the fancy new DNx](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h22m57s)

[uh tooling that is released in net 10.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m01s)

[So you can just do DNx BPK and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m05s)

[you're off to the races. This version](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m08s)

[here is the version of the global tool,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m10s)

[not the version of your library or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m12s)

[otherwise. Be aware of that. But you can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m14s)

[now do this with any um any of the net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m16s)

[tools. So Microsoft added in shorthand](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m20s)

[support because this DNx is short for I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m24s)

[think it's net tool.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m26s)

[um I I think is the the subcomand or you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m31s)

[can just type dnx much shorter. It's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m34s)

[only three characters. I don't think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m36s)

[anyone's going to type the long one. Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m38s)

[but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m40s)

[we go did it finish already](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m43s)

[is already done. Oh. Um but in this case](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m46s)

[what we are looking to update is the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m50s)

[vellac build project. So, this is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m53s)

[project that adds](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m56s)

[uh MS build support into Velopac. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h23m58s)

[and some people are going to hate me and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m02s)

[some people will love me, but the idea](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m04s)

[is rather than needing to do any of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m06s)

[like you still have to do this step here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m11s)

[because I don't know inside of your app](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m14s)

[where you want to do the Velopac app](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m17s)

[build run. Um, and you still have to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m19s)

[the update checks because again in your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m22s)

[app, I don't know how you want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m24s)

[update checks. Um, I've contemplated](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m26s)

[putting together kind of some helper](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m28s)

[libraries where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m29s)

[some common use cases like you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m32s)

[building a WPF app with my net template,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m34s)

[right? Like I can prean in a way that I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m37s)

[like to do updates in my WPF template](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m40s)

[and then if you like it, keep it. If](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m43s)

[not, throw it away. Put your own stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m45s)

[in. Um, because it really depends on how](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m46s)

[you want to do it. Most of the time I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m49s)

[literally will just have my apps update](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m50s)

[on startup and just prompt to push it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m52s)

[through, but you can have them do it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m56s)

[whenever.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m57s)

[Um, but rather than needing to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h24m59s)

[through and do the net tool install and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m01s)

[the um the VPK pack and then followed by](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m05s)

[the VPK publish, the dot or the Velopac](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m10s)

[build project aims to just do MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m14s)

[support so that when you run um net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m16s)

[publish, it does the needful for you.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m19s)

[You don't have to think you're off to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m23s)

[the races, good to go. That's kind of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m24s)

[the goal of what we want, right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m26s)

[So given that what we would like to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m29s)

[um and this branch here that we are on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m34s)

[is where I've I've started down this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m36s)

[path of of building this out and you can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m38s)

[see it's it's gone I let co-pilot start](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m41s)

[and it uh jumped off the deep end but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m45s)

[before what we did is we tried to uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m48s)

[when you make a MS build task there's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m52s)

[actually not a single framework work you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m55s)

[can target because you get a different](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h25m58s)

[runtime whether you're uh being targeted](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m00s)

[by a project run inside of Visual Studio](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m02s)

[or if you are run from the NET CLI. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m05s)

[so most of the time when people build MS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m09s)

[uh build tasks which is like uh well for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m12s)

[example here's the publish task right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m16s)

[which is deriving from my own task which](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m18s)

[derives from um theirs. You end up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m20s)

[having to build a package that targets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m23s)

[multiple net frameworks. You can also do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m27s)

[netstandard 20. You might be able to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m29s)

[21 now. I don't recall. Um, but often](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m32s)

[you'd either target net standard 20 or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m35s)

[you'd have to multi-target in order to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m37s)

[be able to build something appropriate,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m39s)

[right? That was the way it worked. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m42s)

[and the problem was is that meant that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m45s)

[every assembly that this thing called](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m47s)

[had to have something equivalent and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m50s)

[that was biting us on a lot of our other](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m52s)

[Velopac libraries. And so rather than](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m55s)

[fighting with this, what we decided is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m57s)

[okay, we can work around this by just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h26m59s)

[having the Velopac build project do the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m02s)

[needful by executing um VPK for us.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m05s)

[Because really at the end of the day,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m10s)

[what we're looking to do is build up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m11s)

[that VPK command and then just run it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m14s)

[Because when you reference this project,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m17s)

[you end up picking up this build props.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m19s)

[Oh, dear heavens.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m22s)

[Did not format that nicely. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m24s)

[see here. There, that's better. Um, you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m28s)

[pick up this build props and this build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m31s)

[targets file, which is what does all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m33s)

[the actual work. So, uh, when you run,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m35s)

[um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m41s)

[net publish, we can actually register up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m42s)

[our targets with the appropriate](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m46s)

[conditions to run as part of that MS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m48s)

[build task,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m50s)

[which is pretty cool, right? It it means](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m53s)

[that magically things just appear and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m55s)

[you're off to the races, right? I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m57s)

[immediately noticing one problem here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h27m59s)

[Uh, that that ain't going to work if we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m01s)

[don't change that to an eight.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m04s)

[um because that is no bueno. Now I'm a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m06s)

[little paranoid and I just want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m09s)

[search net 6 because I want to make sure](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m11s)

[that we've actually](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m13s)

[those net six references I think are all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m17s)

[perfectly fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m20s)

[Yeah, because all of those are for um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m26s)

[like we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m30s)

[uh for people using the library inside](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m32s)

[their app which is great or boot or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m34s)

[trying to bootstrap with it also fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m36s)

[Okay, so what we have here is Copilot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m39s)

[went and built out these publish tasks](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m42s)

[for us which was ever so nice of it um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m43s)

[and kind of obnoxious. Um the really the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m46s)

[big thing that these tasks are doing is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m50s)

[they are getting the VPK tool and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m52s)

[wanting to actually invoke it. And so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m55s)

[now now we got to clean up the mess that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h28m58s)

[AI has made. So it got me a chunk of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m00s)

[way there. Now we tell it, thank you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m03s)

[very much. Shut up. Let the real](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m05s)

[engineers work. Um so we're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m06s)

[start with pack I think and we'll just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m10s)

[go through this straightforward. The one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m11s)

[nice thing that it did do is it did go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m14s)

[through and build up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m16s)

[all of my options for me because that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m19s)

[was going to be a rinse repeat problem](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m22s)

[and I I like that much better. Um there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m23s)

[is almost assuredly some common code](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m26s)

[that can be pulled out here because both](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m29s)

[of these are doing effectively the exact](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m32s)

[same thing. So we probably need to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m34s)

[consolidate those together. I do want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m37s)

[look at how these things are actually](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m39s)

[working](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m41s)

[um to make sure that I agree on where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m43s)

[this is going to go. And of course, it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m46s)

[doesn't know how to use um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m48s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m53s)

[what do you Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m55s)

[substring can be simplified. I know it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m58s)

[can be, but can it be simplified? It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h29m59s)

[probably can't be simplified on all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m02s)

[targets, can it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m04s)

[Why aren't you? I know the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m07s)

[simplification. It's the range operator.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m09s)

[Range it. You're going to complain that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m12s)

[now it can't be. Yeah. Okay. So, that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m15s)

[the problem. Trying to remember when the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m18s)

[range uh class was added to the BCL. Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m20s)

[Okay. So, we're going to just come in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m24s)

[here. Come in here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m26s)

[And then this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m29s)

[you can be static.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m32s)

[And then I want to look at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m35s)

[net tool runner because what is this guy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m39s)

[actually doing?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m41s)

[So this is actually taking and this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m47s)

[where I'm not confident if I like this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m49s)

[solution or not because this is allowing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m52s)

[it to look at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m55s)

[and run VPK from either if you've got it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h30m58s)

[added as a local tool or bringing it in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m00s)

[as a global. And I don't really want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m03s)

[that because at the end of the day, what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m07s)

[I want this to be is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m09s)

[uh singular you add this package and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m12s)

[then you're done. We don't need extra](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m15s)

[stuff. So I'm kind of questioning if I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m18s)

[want this tool runner to actually be a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m21s)

[thing or if I just want to in embed VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m23s)

[inside of it. Because if we go out and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m27s)

[look, let's take a look here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m30s)

[If I go and pull nougat.org or DK,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m32s)

[right? And we look at the tool,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m36s)

[right? Because this is a this is a tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m39s)

[thing. And we just open it in package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m41s)

[explorer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m44s)

[Back over on the left.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m46s)

[Come on. Download. Run.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m49s)

[Right. So this guy here comes in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h31m54s)

[and this requires having](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m01s)

[this guy set up. I'm just wondering](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m07s)

[can we build a Nougat package that take](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m11s)

[that has a dependency on a tool package?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m13s)

[I don't know what that does. Let's test.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m18s)

[I I honestly don't know what happens if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m22s)

[you bring in a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m25s)

[nougat package or if you bring in a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m28s)

[tooling package as a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m30s)

[uh let's see got to clear my terminal](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m37s)

[boom okay so mkdur](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m40s)

[pool test](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m43s)

[right uh net new console will be fine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m46s)

[bum Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m51s)

[all right. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h32m58s)

[actually what I really want is this open](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m02s)

[in code.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m03s)

[So, let me just do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m06s)

[uh No, stop it. Go away. Uh, explore.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m09s)

[Where are you?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m16s)

[way over on the wrongs.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m18s)

[There we go. So, I'm curious if I add](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m24s)

[VPK as a Nougat pack, what is that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m28s)

[actually going to do?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m31s)

[That's not the way you are supposed to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m33s)

[do. If I go here, does it I can't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m35s)

[imagine that they they filter. If I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m39s)

[this and I install you as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m43s)

[the Nougat package, I think I just get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m48s)

[the package down, don't I?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h33m50s)

[as a package type of .NET tool that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m00s)

[not supported by project tool test.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m02s)

[So it does get a little unhappy if you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m10s)

[end up trying to reference one the wrong](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m12s)

[way. Okay. So we may want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m15s)

[we may want to just package VPK inside](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m21s)

[of this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m24s)

[I may just want to package this in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m29s)

[directly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m31s)

[that way. That way it just works.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m34s)

[I think that's what I want to do. I I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m40s)

[don't know that I want to do anything](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m42s)

[different.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m44s)

[Trying to decide if I would ever go a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m49s)

[different direction.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m52s)

[And I don't think I do. I think I I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m56s)

[to just bundle in the tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h34m58s)

[and bring it in because I think at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m02s)

[end of the day what I'm looking to see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m03s)

[is a package. We go out to nougat.org](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m05s)

[and look at the one that's out there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m09s)

[now. And so for reference if you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m10s)

[using Vellopac build don't um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m12s)

[it's the the current state of it is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m17s)

[little broken. Um which is why we've not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m20s)

[released a full package version of it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m23s)

[yet.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m26s)

[because it is not ready for that. It's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m27s)

[still pre-release.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m31s)

[It got released here with this one. But](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m32s)

[I think what we want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m35s)

[is we want to act I think I just want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m37s)

[put a tools folder in and just literally](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m39s)

[pull in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m42s)

[I I think I just want to pull it in and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m45s)

[do that. I I think that's probably](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m47s)

[better.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m49s)

[I think that's I think that's exactly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m55s)

[what I want. I'm now questioning if I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h35m57s)

[that, is there a reason why I don't just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m01s)

[pull in?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m03s)

[There's a reason I don't just pull in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m08s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m11s)

[pack DL directly and run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m13s)

[because they are all just public. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m19s)

[could just reference this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m21s)

[The issue being that then I have to net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m28s)

[467 this library](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m30s)

[or 472 that library because this is this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m33s)

[is the part of the this is what was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m36s)

[making it difficult before is we had](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m38s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m40s)

[472 dependency floating throughout the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m42s)

[code and we wanted to break it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m44s)

[and I think that's the way we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m48s)

[to end up doing this. I think we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m50s)

[going to break this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m52s)

[Guess I I guess I still have to do the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m55s)

[CLI invocation. Okay, so we want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h36m57s)

[change this up. Let's let's get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h37m00s)

[ourselves back into a compiling state](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h37m02s)

[first and then I think we're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h37m04s)

[change up this tool like this tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h37m06s)

[resolver is going to die because we are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h37m07s)

[Um, okay. So, what do we got here?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m11s)

[Is just dead name spaces. So, we're just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m15s)

[going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m17s)

[Why are you unhappy that this logging](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m20s)

[doesn't exist?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m23s)

[It exists on one of them.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m25s)

[Something really](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m29s)

[I don't know why it's refusing to clean](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m32s)

[up. If I do that,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m34s)

[oh, it's clearly there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m38s)

[Um, okay. Wait a minute. Why do I have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m40s)

[net five or greater?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m42s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m46s)

[net six. Hello. And actually, I think we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m48s)

[just bumped this to eight, didn't we?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m52s)

[Yeah. So, net eight.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m53s)

[But we're going to go there for a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m57s)

[moment.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h38m59s)

[Um, eight because it uh Oh, and this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m00s)

[pulled this guy in. Start redirecting.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m05s)

[Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m08s)

[minute. This is because I file it. Hold](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m09s)

[up. Hold up. Hold up. Undo all changes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m11s)

[in this file.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m14s)

[This one we want to ignore and we want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m17s)

[to because I just I I pulled it in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m18s)

[because we had some process stuff that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m20s)

[looked like it was going to be helpful](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m22s)

[and I think I just rejected that idea.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m24s)

[We are going for running state first or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m28s)

[compiling state first and then we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m31s)

[going to go break this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m33s)

[because I think we're we're just going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m37s)

[to delete the mode. We're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m39s)

[change all of this up because I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m42s)

[think we're going to allow](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m44s)

[we're not going to allow setting the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m47s)

[VPK tool source, tool mode, tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m50s)

[version. All of that's going to die. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m53s)

[let's see here. Argument builder.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h39m59s)

[yeah. So, let's just do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m06s)

[this for the moment. We're gonna just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m10s)

[We're going to just do this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m12s)

[Whack that out just to get that going.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m15s)

[And then we're going to return double](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m18s)

[empty for the moment. And then we'll get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m22s)

[this thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m23s)

[Yeah, you're going to flag me all over](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m26s)

[on the configure awaits no reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m28s)

[thing. Great. Great. Lots of warnings to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m30s)

[be yelled at about. Got it. I get it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m32s)

[You're unhappy. You don't like me. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m34s)

[deleted a file you wanted to keep, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m36s)

[we're changing up. We're changing up,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m39s)

[Copilot. I'm sorry. Going to have to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m41s)

[just accept the fact that I'm the real](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m43s)

[engineer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m44s)

[Yes, Copilot. I'm going to do things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m47s)

[slower and dumber than you. Get used to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m49s)

[it. Okay. Argument builder test. Well, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m51s)

[deleted that file so the test class can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m54s)

[go with it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m56s)

[Oh, that that's a good sign because that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h40m58s)

[means we are down to just that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m01s)

[Boom. Okay, we are compiling. Good,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m14s)

[good, good, good. Let's make us not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m17s)

[compile anymore. Okay, so step one mode](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m18s)

[enume tool mode itself is just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m21s)

[die. That's not going to be a thing that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m23s)

[exists.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m26s)

[Um, in fact, I think can we kill this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m28s)

[whole thing? Yeah, we can kill this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m31s)

[whole class because we're not going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m33s)

[have any like we're going to bundle the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m35s)

[tool in. Um, let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m37s)

[Resolve tool. This is going to go away.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m42s)

[So, this whole file dies. Then we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m44s)

[going to see how much of a mess that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m46s)

[makes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m48s)

[Okay. So, a little bit of a mess.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m51s)

[Harsh tool mode. That dies.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m54s)

[Has to be the right answer. Deleting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h41m59s)

[code is almost always the right answer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m01s)

[Uh, let's see. Tool mode, pre-release,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m05s)

[tool source, skip tool, install. We're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m08s)

[going to just get rid of all of that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m10s)

[Actually, I want to hunt](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m13s)

[this string before I nuke it. And I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m16s)

[going to nuke it because I think I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m19s)

[to kill off all usages, which is almost](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m21s)

[assuredly going to lead me down a path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m25s)

[of clearing out more stuff. So this guy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m27s)

[here is all dead.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m30s)

[This guy here is all dead because pilot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m32s)

[really really likes to duplicate stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m35s)

[because reasons,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m39s)

[right? Two classes that have a common](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m41s)

[base. Why would it put it in the base](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m43s)

[class? That would make too much sense.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m45s)

[It would not be the way of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m47s)

[co-pilots. Okay. So then these ones](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m48s)

[here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m51s)

[I think we skip all of these.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m54s)

[None of those need to exist.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h42m57s)

[Uh, and then down here, all of these go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m01s)

[away.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m04s)

[And same with here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m06s)

[we go. Okay. So, that gets us to there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m09s)

[Ideally, I want to go through and plug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m13s)

[this into one of my apps to see it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m14s)

[actually work. Okay. And then this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m16s)

[going to clean up some stuff here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m18s)

[Uh, let's see here. Auto. Auto. Auto.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m22s)

[This](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m26s)

[Like dear heavens co-pilot like this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m27s)

[no no this is not no like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m30s)

[bad co-pilot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m35s)

[I'm going to ban reflection calls](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m38s)

[keep you from doing stupid stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m41s)

[um because you do not test by](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m45s)

[reflecting in on the private functions.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m49s)

[Okay, so that's obviously going to leave](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m52s)

[us broken. But let's see how broken,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m56s)

[I think. Then we want to go and take a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h43m59s)

[look at what is what we're doing here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m01s)

[Here we go. Okay, config doesn't exist](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m05s)

[in current context. Okay, so the idea](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m06s)

[here before was it would resolve the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m09s)

[tool and then it would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m11s)

[do this net tool runner. I think what I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m13s)

[want to do instead](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m17s)

[is I think I want to just rename this to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m21s)

[VPK tool runner](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m23s)

[and then we're just going to beat this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m26s)

[thing into submission. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m28s)

[is it it's the one that has run tool and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m32s)

[so I think I just want run tool to take](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m35s)

[in the relevant like command line](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m38s)

[configury bits and I don't want it to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m40s)

[anything.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m44s)

[I want VPK lowercased. Um so let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m47s)

[So I don't think we need the resolver at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m52s)

[all.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m54s)

[I don't think this is going to be a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m56s)

[relevant thing. The the resolution of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h44m58s)

[where the tool is found is going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m00s)

[handled in that other class. This is all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m03s)

[about finding it in the global versus](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m06s)

[local tool. So, yeah. So, we're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m07s)

[just burn this class to the ground, too.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m09s)

[Uh head is in the way. That's why I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m12s)

[can't see it. Okay. Uh delete.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m14s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m18s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m20s)

[So, resolver is going to die.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m22s)

[tool's going to die.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m26s)

[And then we're going to rename you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m28s)

[uh to VPK tool runner, I think, is going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m31s)

[to be the thing. And then the the key](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m34s)

[part here is we're going to need to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m36s)

[package this guy up so that the VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m38s)

[output ends up inside of this guy. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m42s)

[we're going to end up with a dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m44s)

[on those, which is fine. We can we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m47s)

[add that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m49s)

[Okay. Okay. Yeah, because this guy has](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m52s)

[all the process start stuff. Blah blah](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m53s)

[blah. Great. That's kind of what what we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m55s)

[want to get to. Um, update tool async.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h45m58s)

[See, this is going to die.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m01s)

[Don't need any of this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m04s)

[We don't need install tool. Like, we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m07s)

[just going to get rid of a bunch of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m09s)

[stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m10s)

[Bunch of stuff. Run tool. We want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m12s)

[keep. Um, we won't need tool name](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m14s)

[because that's just going to be VPK. Get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m17s)

[installed version. We won't need that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m19s)

[The installed version is the one that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m21s)

[installed. Great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m23s)

[Okay. So, what do you want? Primary](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m25s)

[constructor. Sure. Primary constructor.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m28s)

[That beast. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m30s)

[do that. Do that. And then I don't need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m35s)

[to worry about that. Okay. So, that gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m38s)

[me to there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m41s)

[I like that a lot better.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m43s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m46s)

[we may not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m53s)

[may not care too much about that because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m55s)

[we are going to have a small amount of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h46m57s)

[and this is why I was looking at our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m00s)

[core one for our process stuff. I may](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m02s)

[want to split that file and still bring](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m04s)

[it in because we do have this process](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m06s)

[extensions because this is the file that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m09s)

[I had file linked in before because it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m12s)

[does have some useful stuff for like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m14s)

[starting process](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m17s)

[uh redirecting output watching it,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m19s)

[appending command line arguments, doing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m22s)

[all of that stuff in a nice manner](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m23s)

[because we polyfilled some of the things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m27s)

[in to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m29s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m31s)

[bring us nice support for actually](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m33s)

[running processes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m35s)

[So I think we may end up want the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m39s)

[disadvantage here is this guy has this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m42s)

[line right here. Um so we may end up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m45s)

[needing to split this file across two](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m48s)

[um and then file link in the bits that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m52s)

[we want. That way we can file link this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m55s)

[without the backlogger because I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h47m58s)

[want to pull this as well. There's no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m00s)

[real reason for bringing this one in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m03s)

[because this is a public facing thing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m04s)

[and this is going to be all internal. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m06s)

[we may end up doing that. But let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m08s)

[let's get ourselves compiling again](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m11s)

[before we get too carried away.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m14s)

[Doesn't exist in current context. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m19s)

[So log message](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m23s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m29s)

[executing VPK pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m31s)

[with args. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m36s)

[Uh we need to change run tool to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m39s)

[we'll leave the VPK there. We don't need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m44s)

[the is local anymore. That's going to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m46s)

[away.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m48s)

[Um, and I think we may be setting the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m50s)

[we'll leave working directory for now. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m55s)

[don't think we actually want it though.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h48m58s)

[No, because we want to run in the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m01s)

[context of be of wherever started from.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m02s)

[So, we're going to get rid of that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m06s)

[Uh, let's see here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m08s)

[Whack that. Whack that. Whack that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m11s)

[We're just We're just going to cruise](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m15s)

[right on through this. uh because I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m16s)

[don't think I actually want any of that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m18s)

[bit in there. So, this guy running.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m21s)

[Let's see. So, what is that environment](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m25s)

[variables?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m26s)

[I don't think we I'll I'll leave the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m28s)

[environment variables there, but I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m31s)

[think we have a reason to need those.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m32s)

[Um it wants configure a weight. Great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m36s)

[Um this is mildly needed for the net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m39s)

[framework stuff for people who are conf](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m42s)

[uh confused about this configure weight.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m44s)

[Um, when you hit an async and an await](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m47s)

[is out of C#, everything that follows it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m50s)

[gets kind of bundled into a promise or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m53s)

[an continuation or a callback or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m55s)

[whatever terminology makes sense in your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h49m58s)

[language. Um, and the question is who](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m00s)

[executes that? What what thread? Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m03s)

[configure await true says, hey, if the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m07s)

[calling thread actually had like UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m09s)

[context, the continuation should also be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m12s)

[back on that same UI context. If it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m15s)

[didn't have any um execution context,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m17s)

[yeah, or uh synchronization context,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m19s)

[whatever, right? Anyone can pick it up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m22s)

[And because there are some cases where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m24s)

[you might have one of those specifically](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m27s)

[in net framework configurate false is um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m29s)

[a performance boost because it says I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m32s)

[don't care who runs my continuation.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m36s)

[First guy available gets to do it. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m38s)

[that's what the analyzer is flagging](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m41s)

[there. It's saying hey we'll let anyone](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m43s)

[do it. Great. Okay. So that guy is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m45s)

[there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m49s)

[continue on our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m50s)

[quest to to murder all the bad code. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m53s)

[that's going to go there. It's got this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h50m59s)

[idea that there's environment varss](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m01s)

[there. Um, let's see. This is BPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m03s)

[publish.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m08s)

[I don't think we need that. Do that. We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m09s)

[aren't going to use the is local. We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m12s)

[said we were going to kill the working](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m15s)

[directory. So, that much is going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m16s)

[work. It wants the configure weight](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m17s)

[false again.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m19s)

[Put that in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m21s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m23s)

[Squawking about these.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m26s)

[Um, if it's not null or whites space,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m29s)

[possible null reference exception. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m32s)

[yes, but no. Um, the reason it's it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m38s)

[flags this as potentially null even](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m41s)

[though we explicitly have a null or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m43s)

[whitespace check here is because this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m46s)

[a property. So the the getter is invoked](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m48s)

[here and then it's also invoked again](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m52s)

[here. So it's technically the getter](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m54s)

[could return two different values](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h51m58s)

[practically. No. So we're just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m00s)

[null suppress. I don't even know if this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m02s)

[is how we want to end up doing it, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m04s)

[we'll just no suppress for the moment to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m09s)

[to get it to shut up. We'll come back to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m10s)

[it when we need to.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m13s)

[Okay, working directory does not exist.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m18s)

[Correct. So, let's see. We are runn net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m21s)

[command.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m25s)

[See, we're going to ax working directory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m27s)

[out of here and then exit out of here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m29s)

[Then we're going to exit out of here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m32s)

[Okay. Um, this is obviously going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m35s)

[need to be renamed.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m38s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m41s)

[yeah. So, we're going to just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m47s)

[run BPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m50s)

[and we're going to change this to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m53s)

[BPK.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m56s)

[uh do get full path because we are going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h52m58s)

[to need to find the the appropriate one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m02s)

[to grab.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m04s)

[Um and we may it may end up actually](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m06s)

[still needing to be a net command.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m08s)

[We'll we'll we'll check. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m14s)

[don't know that I can assume that it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m18s)

[won't be,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m19s)

[but I've got GitHub runners, so we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m21s)

[we can run it on different platforms and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m23s)

[find out.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m25s)

[Okay, so that gets me to there. Gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m26s)

[gets me to there. Compile again.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m28s)

[Make sure we're in a building state and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m33s)

[then we'll work backwards from there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m34s)

[Looks like tests are next. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m36s)

[see. So, this test is complete garbage](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m38s)

[now because we got rid of it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m40s)

[Configuration should allow setting all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m43s)

[properties. Worthless test. Uh, let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m44s)

[see. Actually, VPK configuration tests](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m48s)

[are complete trash as well. So, we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m50s)

[just going to kill those. Resolve tools](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m53s)

[is probably trash as well. The whole](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m57s)

[file is trash. Great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h53m59s)

[Look at this. So much less code.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m02s)

[Oh, so true is really meaning something](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m09s)

[like I want to return to the same](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m11s)

[thread, which likely to be UI thread.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m13s)

[I've been using that all wrong. Uh, so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m17s)

[close, Izzy. And this is one of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m19s)

[things that always hates me. There's so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m21s)

[much nuance around this. Configure await](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m23s)

[true says return back to the calling](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m26s)

[synchronization context if present. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m29s)

[it doesn't guarantee that you're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m33s)

[back. It all depends on who calls you.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m35s)

[So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m38s)

[likely going back to the so it was added](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m39s)

[because of things like WPF, Windforms,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m42s)

[etc. where there is a UI thread and it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m46s)

[makes a lot of sense to say, hey, when I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m49s)

[click a button, I want to go do this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m50s)

[asynchrony thing and then afterwards I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m52s)

[want to update my UI and so if it if the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m55s)

[thing after the await didn't come back](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m57s)

[to the UI thread, you couldn't touch](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h54m59s)

[your UI problem.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m00s)

[Um, which is why it was there, but it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m03s)

[also uh a performance bottleneck when](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m07s)

[you say my continuation really needs to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m09s)

[be run by the UI thread. Therefore, I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m11s)

[going to wait until he's ready. um even](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m13s)

[if somebody else is available, another](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m16s)

[thread is available to process me right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m18s)

[away. Which is why configure weight](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m20s)

[false is preferable when the thing in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m22s)

[the continuation doesn't actually care](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m25s)

[about which thread picks it up, right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m28s)

[So true means it might go back to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m31s)

[the original thread if there was um a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m34s)

[synchronization context to go back to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m38s)

[because if if you hit that await with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m40s)

[configure weight true and you're on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m42s)

[background thread already and the caller](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m43s)

[was a background thread, there is no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m45s)

[synchronization context to go back to.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m48s)

[So configure await true just doesn't do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m49s)

[anything. So that's that's the kicker.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m51s)

[It's back to the original when it has a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m53s)

[synchronization context. Background](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m57s)

[threads from the thread pool don't have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h55m59s)

[one. UI threads do. So depending on who](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m01s)

[the caller was, you may or may not get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m04s)

[back to the original,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m07s)

[which is it's kind of expected though.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m09s)

[Like the longer I sat and thought about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m12s)

[it, it's like well that's kind of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m13s)

[behavior I want. But it's it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m15s)

[confusing. As soon as something goes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m18s)

[wrong and you have to like mentally do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m20s)

[the gymnastics to understand why this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m22s)

[thing is right or wrong, it then gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m25s)

[much more interesting.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m28s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m30s)

[requires CLI and network access. Oh dear](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m32s)

[heavens, co-pilot,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m36s)

[you are a fascinating exercise in dear](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m38s)

[heavens. What the heck have you done?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m42s)

[Yeah. Yeah. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m45s)

[we're just going to murder this. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m48s)

[we're not. No, we're we're not doing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m51s)

[that. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m53s)

[Yeah, that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h56m58s)

[uh I may still be using it uh wrong. Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m01s)

[may explain why some of my apps seem to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m04s)

[have UI stalls. Yeah, it's you certainly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m07s)

[can be and it is a way to cause a UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m09s)

[hang with a configure await true. like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m12s)

[it absolutely is. So, usually what I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m15s)

[tell people to do is set it to configure](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m18s)

[await false always and see if you get a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m21s)

[cross thread exception. Like often times](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m25s)

[that's how you're doing it. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m28s)

[especially if you're in an MVVM setup,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m29s)

[most of the time if you're inside of a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m33s)

[view model, you probably don't care](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m35s)

[because if you're just updating a simple](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m38s)

[property, the binding handles the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m40s)

[synchronization back to the the UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m43s)

[because when the binding updates the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m45s)

[property, that effectively sets a dirty](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m47s)

[flag on the UI to say on the next paint,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m49s)

[this thing needs to be updated. So you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m53s)

[don't on a regular binding you don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m55s)

[even have to worry about the UI thread](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m57s)

[that much. Observable collection is one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h57m58s)

[of the few cases where that's not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m01s)

[entirely true. Um but there is the uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m03s)

[under the binding operations class](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m07s)

[there's a static method called enabled](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m09s)

[collection synchronization to work](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m11s)

[around that. So effectively you give it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m13s)

[your own object to say hey here's the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m17s)

[thing that we're going to synchronize on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m19s)

[so that if you touch this from](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m21s)

[background thread or I'm touching it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m23s)

[from the UI thread we both agree on what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m24s)

[object we're going to lock on to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m27s)

[synchronize to be able to interact with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m28s)

[this. Um in MVVM I just use the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m30s)

[messenger send messages back to the UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m34s)

[thread. Yeah, that certainly works. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m36s)

[only thing you do have to be a little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m39s)

[careful of is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m40s)

[when you do that messenger send um it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m43s)

[with the like the MVVM framework those](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m47s)

[message sends are synchronous calls. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m50s)

[if you are doing a messenger send and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m52s)

[the receive message on the other side](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m55s)

[does a lot of work that can potentially](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h58m58s)

[be problematic and it's one of those](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m00s)

[weird things because you don't really](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m02s)

[want the sender to have to think about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m03s)

[that. And usually what that means is I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m05s)

[will do like on the UI thread like a uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m08s)

[on the receive I'll do like a dispatcher](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m11s)

[begin invoke. That way the UI can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m13s)

[receive the message. But the begin](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m16s)

[invoke cues up a handler to actually do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m18s)

[the UI updates uh on the next pass](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m20s)

[around because you can also set um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m24s)

[dispatcher priority where you can say](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m26s)

[okay cue this call back to run on the UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m29s)

[thread but honestly I don't need it at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m31s)

[the highest priority because I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m33s)

[dispatcher priority normal is about in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m35s)

[the middle if I remember correctly with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m37s)

[like user input being right near the top](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m40s)

[or that kind of thing. So you can kind](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m42s)

[of decide what level of priority does](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m44s)

[this UI call back need to be done at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m47s)

[that level. And once you're on um like a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m49s)

[code behind or similar for that receive](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m52s)

[like you've got full access to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m55s)

[dispatcher and anything you need to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=00h59m56s)

[Okay, there's that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m00s)

[Okay, so we are back compiling. So then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m06s)

[let's go through and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m08s)

[I would like to get this thing building](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m11s)

[properly. The code is all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m14s)

[all kinds of wrong but I need to be able](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m17s)

[to test this to know that we are running](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m20s)

[properly. So I would like to look Do we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m24s)

[not have our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m28s)

[Oh, there's my build demo. I was like I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m30s)

[I thought we had all of our stuff in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m32s)

[here. Oh, but we don't have our our full](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m34s)

[thing in here. So, let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m37s)

[Oh, what did I just do? Give me back.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m40s)

[Um, I would like to add in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m43s)

[GitHub folder. I would like to add in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m47s)

[uh nope, not new item, existing item.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m52s)

[Add existing item](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m55s)

[GitHub.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h00m58s)

[I think I want to do workflows as well](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m00s)

[because I think I just want to add all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m02s)

[of these in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m04s)

[I like to be able to search these from](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m06s)

[Visual Studio. It doesn't matter as much](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m07s)

[in other IDs, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m10s)

[GitHub workflows and then give me all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m13s)

[these. Give me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m16s)

[what the current open solution file. Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m21s)

[is build.yml YAML inside of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m24s)

[GitHub.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m30s)

[Oh, look at that. Okay, so I'm going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m32s)

[remove this one because I actually would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m34s)

[prefer it nested in the relevant thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m36s)

[Uh, get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m40s)

[there. There we go. Now, now we can now](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m44s)

[we can talk. Okay, so build packages is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m47s)

[going to be inside of here. Inside of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m50s)

[here. download Python.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m52s)

[And really what I'm looking for is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m56s)

[uh the Velopac build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h01m59s)

[uh cuz where does it actually grab it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m03s)

[Build samples](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m10s)

[of pack.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m15s)

[I have a strange feeling we're picking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m18s)

[it up by accident by virtue of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m20s)

[probably a net pack or something at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m24s)

[solution level.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m26s)

[Yeah, that's kind of what I was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m31s)

[wondering.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m33s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m39s)

[Let's see. Uh let's see. I mean I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m41s)

[processor whatever uh it's actually](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m43s)

[called. I use that to do inter thread](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m46s)

[messaging and usually the hander just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m48s)

[reroutes the context vi messenger. Ah](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m50s)

[okay. Yes. Yes it is. Though I processor](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m52s)

[is pro or I process is probably your own](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m55s)

[or another library. I don't recognize](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m57s)

[that as a built-in type.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h02m59s)

[But yes it's very common to see that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m02s)

[pattern set up somewhere. I'm surprised](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m04s)

[this doesn't show me what I expected.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m08s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m11s)

[load core bins pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m14s)

[pack.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m17s)

[I am wondering if this is actually if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m21s)

[it's been dropped](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m24s)

[already. Download VPK. Download lib.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m27s)

[Check out](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m32s)

[generate release.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m34s)

[Like Kayn did some exceptional work on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m37s)

[all these pipelines.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m39s)

[Uh, let's see. Public nougat packages.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m42s)

[Yeah, see this is what I was worried](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m44s)

[about is we've got something of this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m45s)

[nature where it's where it's ripping](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m48s)

[through all of our packages and grabbing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m50s)

[them.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m52s)

[Um, and we are probably picking this up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m54s)

[by virtue of the fact that it is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h03m58s)

[just grabbing all of these. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m01s)

[let me look out on the repo real quick](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m08s)

[because I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m11s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m14s)

[I think this is probably not.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m18s)

[I think this is probably not adding in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m31s)

[the job summary.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m35s)

[Uh because this isn't going to be a I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m39s)

[need a build off of main](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m41s)

[uh branch or I guess a build off](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m44s)

[develop.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m47s)

[I need to look at the artifacts here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m51s)

[but this guy is expired, so I don't have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m55s)

[one to look at. Dang it. Okay, I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m57s)

[it's been dropped. I think it's been](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h04m59s)

[dropped and I think we just do net pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m02s)

[on the solution if I remember correctly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m05s)

[and because of that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m08s)

[because of that we don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m13s)

[um end up with any of these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m17s)

[because looking at this there's nothing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m21s)

[uh workflow build packages is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m26s)

[and this guy here I believe has to have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m30s)

[Python Rust because I don't even see the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m34s)

[VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m37s)

[npm pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m42s)

[like where is the VPK pack because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m45s)

[obviously that's going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m48s)

[and I don't see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m50s)

[Oh, I bet you this is it. I bet you it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m54s)

[got pack- on build set. I bet you that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h05m57s)

[what's happening is we're running](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m00s)

[I bet you that's how it's doing it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m03s)

[Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m07s)

[pack on build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m11s)

[I see the name pack as tool.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m15s)

[I don't see pack on build being set, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m20s)

[let me just search because I believe the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m23s)

[MS build property is called pack-on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m26s)

[build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m28s)

[Um, but I have to believe it's this line](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m32s)

[right here that's doing it that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m34s)

[getting us there. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m37s)

[is this guy does have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m42s)

[the build props that's got to be set on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m47s)

[here? It's got to be set on one of these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m49s)

[um output path before path map products](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m51s)

[and assembly blah blah blah doing the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h06m57s)

[versioning. Let let me just look at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m00s)

[output directory and let's see if we see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m03s)

[the Nougat package there because I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m06s)

[want to be able to run the command](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m08s)

[locally.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m09s)

[Wrong screen. Um and actually get the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m12s)

[the output.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m16s)

[So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m19s)

[release does that have all the packages?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m21s)

[It does have all the packages in it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m23s)

[That has it there. And under debug,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m27s)

[I see a whole bunch of build packages in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m30s)

[here. So, and if I do date modified,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m33s)

[yeah, look at that. There it is. So, it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m37s)

[is it is packaging these things up on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m39s)

[build. Okay, perfect. Because 953, that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m42s)

[was probably the last time I had a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m46s)

[successful build. Perfect. Um, and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m48s)

[I need do I have nougat package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m52s)

[I don't think I have it. Okay. A](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h07m58s)

[wonderful little app. Wind get search.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m00s)

[Uh let's do nug get uh package.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m04s)

[We'll find it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m12s)

[Find me or get me close to the name.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m15s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m19s)

[not it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m22s)

[Search nougat. There is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m28s)

[why is the only hit coming from the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m30s)

[store?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m34s)

[Really?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m37s)

[That really I I could have sworn there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m39s)

[was a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m41s)

[Sorry, I'm searching the Windows Store](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m47s)

[really quick because I want to see the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m49s)

[store listing for this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m50s)

[Look at that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m52s)

[It is in fact the app that I'm looking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m55s)

[for. Claims installed. Okay. Or it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h08m57s)

[claims it's it is owned by me.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m00s)

[Okay. I I guess we could always use the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m04s)

[maybe that's why we don't have it is you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m06s)

[can use the browser based one here as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m09s)

[well. I guess to do it right is I can go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m11s)

[here browse and then I can grab my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m14s)

[I can grab my Velopac one this way.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m19s)

[and get to it. So, if I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m22s)

[this,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m27s)

[right, and I go build and I go debug,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m29s)

[um, I can come in here, date modified,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m33s)

[and grab this is the the s the symbols](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m36s)

[nougat package. We want this one,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m40s)

[right? And that's probably why I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m43s)

[see the app is they just favored the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m46s)

[browser based one. So, this is fine that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m49s)

[it's got the build stuff, right? It's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m51s)

[got We can look at the files inside of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m53s)

[each of these, which is goodish. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m55s)

[not quite what we want to get to. We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m58s)

[want to kill off a good chunk of these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h09m59s)

[and get them down a lot smaller. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m02s)

[but the good part is now we've got Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m05s)

[so all I have to do is compile and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m07s)

[load the Nougat package to test. Great,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m09s)

[great, great, great, great, great,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m12s)

[great, great, great. That is what we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m13s)

[would like. So inside of here, what are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m16s)

[my dependencies?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m20s)

[I don't know why it is still picking up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m24s)

[the other Velopac stuff because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m26s)

[pack build is down to just that. So, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m31s)

[think I just need to clean my output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m34s)

[and then repackage because what I was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m37s)

[seeing is all of the extra](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m39s)

[um bell pack libraries in here like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m43s)

[packaging shouldn't be there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m46s)

[So, this guy I think we just need to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m49s)

[clean him up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m52s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m54s)

[just whack all these two.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h10m57s)

[We go. Okay. And then we're going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m00s)

[rebuild and see if those things go away](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m02s)

[because I have a feeling it was just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m05s)

[grabbing all the assemblies um from](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m07s)

[around there. Okay. So now if I come in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m12s)

[here, great. New package. We're off to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m14s)

[the races. File open. Do you remember my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m18s)

[last path? Of course you don't. Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m21s)

[let me grab the store app because this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m25s)

[is going to get annoying beyond belief.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m27s)

[Uh, open local package. Actually, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m29s)

[think I can just drag drop if I remember](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m32s)

[right. I think I can just literally go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m33s)

[and do that there. Much easier. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m37s)

[we have build 472. Okay, we are down to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m41s)

[something that resembles a lot smaller](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m45s)

[than what we had before. And we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m47s)

[probably get this even smaller than that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m50s)

[when all is said and done.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m54s)

[Okay, because we probably won't need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h11m56s)

[half this stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m00s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m03s)

[get this all the way down.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m06s)

[Great, great, great, great, great,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m08s)

[great. Okay, but the rest of those I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m10s)

[not as concerned with.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m11s)

[Uh, I got to close that dialogue to move](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m14s)

[my browser. Okay, so we've got all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m16s)

[these because some of these are going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m19s)

[be coming from the build utility stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m20s)

[Great. Fine. Whatever.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m22s)

[Okay. So, next thing we want to do is we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m24s)

[want to get in the the VPK tooling. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m26s)

[we want to take the output from VPK and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m31s)

[we want it embedded inside of the tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m36s)

[folder in uh inside of here. So, I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m40s)

[going to let Copilot loose on this so I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m44s)

[don't have to figure out the syntax. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m45s)

[I want the Nougat package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m48s)

[generated](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m52s)

[from Velopac build to include the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h12m54s)

[compiled output from the Velopac VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m00s)

[project inside of the tools](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m06s)

[in my Nougat package.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m11s)

[Get copilot impress me make it so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m16s)

[because it should be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m18s)

[like I know roughly what I'm looking to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m21s)

[see. I'm looking to see the dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m23s)

[get added and then a handful of MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m25s)

[stuff explicitly mapping with a globbing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m27s)

[pattern](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m30s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m31s)

[that uh the output from Vellopac VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m33s)

[into here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m37s)

[project dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m41s)

[that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m44s)

[that may or may not be okay](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m47s)

[do a project dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m50s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m53s)

[equals net 6, net 8, net 9. We don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h13m58s)

[need all of these.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m02s)

[And I'm cur I don't think this project](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m08s)

[reference works for the 472.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m11s)

[So like this is kind of what you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m14s)

[close copilot, but I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m17s)

[going to compile.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m19s)

[Uh let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m21s)

[Great. Now, let me run a build. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m24s)

[good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m26s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m28s)

[conditionally for the net 8 target.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m31s)

[That's fine, I think, because I think it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m37s)

[will be okay if we just reference it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m41s)

[that way.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m44s)

[Um because Velopac build is 472 and 48.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m46s)

[So we don't ever need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m50s)

[verify compile successfully. Yeah, I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h14m59s)

[sure you did. Thank you. Now shut up. Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m01s)

[keep and then let me let me edit this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m04s)

[No, shut up. Keep](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m09s)

[that keep. I now just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m12s)

[I just wanna](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m15s)

[Okay, so let's rebuild this guy and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m18s)

[retest him.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m21s)

[I want to see what that ends up doing. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m23s)

[think I think once we rebuild, I can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m26s)

[literally just go reload.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m28s)

[Or am I getting the I might be getting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m31s)

[the MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m34s)

[um output app confused here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m36s)

[Close.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m40s)

[Come on.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m48s)

[Though I realize that now that there's a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m52s)

[project dependency, every time I go to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m54s)

[buildac](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m56s)

[build, it is going to have to do all the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h15m57s)

[dependencies. Okay. So, we immediately](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m00s)

[have problem one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m02s)

[is it ain't in there. So, that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m05s)

[problem one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m09s)

[Uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m12s)

[Before targets generate noug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m15s)

[um I think we actually only](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m20s)

[because I'm not sure that this is the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m34s)

[right target to do this in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m36s)

[I don't know that we we don't think have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m40s)

[many examples, but actually the build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m44s)

[targets file is probably the closest.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m48s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m51s)

[but these are triggering on the publish.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h16m57s)

[So, let's just pull open the MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m00s)

[log on this, I think.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m04s)

[Yeah, I think that's the way we do this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m08s)

[Uh, let's see here. So, CD](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m11s)

[private uh villa pack. Uh, let's see. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m15s)

[think it's uh yeah, CD source.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m19s)

[Uh, let's see. CD.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m24s)

[I think this is where it is. Nope.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m30s)

[Where are you located?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m33s)

[Oh, it's under the VPK directory. Got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m37s)

[it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m39s)

[VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m43s)

[develop](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m45s)

[build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m47s)

[uh net build and then hyphen BL for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m50s)

[binary log.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m53s)

[I want to see what this thing ends up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h17m58s)

[doing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m00s)

[Yeah, because once you reference VPK,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m10s)

[um, you pick up all the downstream](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m13s)

[dependencies, which is pretty much the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m15s)

[rest of the, uh, the library. Why are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m17s)

[you flagging me here?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m20s)

[Still want to update again? Okay. Wow.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m23s)

[Didn't you have enough fun with your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m26s)

[updates? Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m27s)

[show me the bin log. Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m31s)

[I not have that tool either. I've got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m34s)

[the structured log viewer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m37s)

[must not be registered as the handler](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m50s)

[for that file type. That's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m52s)

[Looks like it is.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m56s)

[Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h18m59s)

[what we do here, so for those people who](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m03s)

[haven't seen this, this is how you debug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m05s)

[your MS build stuff. Um, so we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m06s)

[to one start with this target here and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m09s)

[just hunt it to see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m12s)

[our target didn't run, which that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m14s)

[probably a pretty good indication as why](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m17s)

[it didn't work. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m19s)

[which means the generate new spec target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m23s)

[that it tried to bind to probably](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m26s)

[doesn't exist.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m28s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m31s)

[okay. So, that kind of works.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m37s)

[Uh, let's see. Generate new spec depends](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m42s)

[on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m45s)

[uh all of these things here. But I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m47s)

[curious where the generate new spec](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m50s)

[depends on actually gets consumed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m54s)

[pack depends on generate new spec](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h19m58s)

[target generate new spec. So let's see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m04s)

[this guy ran.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m07s)

[So, how come our target didn't get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m10s)

[picked up for this?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m13s)

[Let's see. Is newer](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m19s)

[because this target was selected. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m25s)

[which means ours should have been](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m29s)

[included.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m32s)

[I guess the question is was target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m36s)

[framework net 8 at the point it got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m38s)

[here. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m40s)

[and it probably wasn't.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m46s)

[It probably wasn't.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m51s)

[Um, but I think we don't need to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m54s)

[condition](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h20m57s)

[here. I think we just want this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m01s)

[And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m05s)

[I'm kind of tempted to just whack this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m12s)

[con this guy here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m14s)

[is the only reason for having this um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m18s)

[is we're not referencing the output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m26s)

[assembly. So we won't get a dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m27s)

[there. private assets. It's setting it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m29s)

[up completely as private.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m32s)

[Um I don't know what Oh, visible. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m42s)

[it's hiding it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m44s)

[What is visible false doing here? This](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m47s)

[isn't bringing anything in my item](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m49s)

[group, is it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m52s)

[Like I realize visible false is useful](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m55s)

[for hiding things but I don't think it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m57s)

[relevant here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h21m59s)

[So I think now if we do this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m02s)

[build again](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m06s)

[this should](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m08s)

[just work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m11s)

[Okay. So let's go here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m17s)

[Okay, we got that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m23s)

[Uh, file, close.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m26s)

[Bring that in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m32s)

[Not there. So, that's still no no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m36s)

[workie. Come here. We go F5.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m38s)

[Reload it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m44s)

[And then this guy down here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m47s)

[Generate new spec.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m51s)

[Where is Why would it not pick this up?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h22m59s)

[Why would it not load our build?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m06s)

[This guy here came in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m15s)

[Okay, so it's before target generate new](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m25s)

[spec.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m28s)

[That feels right.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m30s)

[Oh, I wonder if it's because it Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m36s)

[I bet you it's this one here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m44s)

[that because we don't have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m48s)

[this generate new spec depends on.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m52s)

[I bet you this guy is exp. Okay, I bet](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h23m56s)

[you it's it is being set and then it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m00s)

[being overridden. I bet you that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m01s)

[what's happening.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m04s)

[Um, so I think what we want to do is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m06s)

[something slightly different. We want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m11s)

[take](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m14s)

[that guy there. And I think I want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m17s)

[generate](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m21s)

[new spec.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m24s)

[Grab this because I don't want to I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m26s)

[don't want to botch this. I think I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m28s)

[to do depends on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m29s)

[then I want to grab the current value](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m32s)

[that's in there and I want to just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m34s)

[append me to it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m37s)

[because I bet you what's happening is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m40s)

[because we are just registering up we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m42s)

[are probably getting overridden. Let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m44s)

[try this again](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m46s)

[because what I expect to see is my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m51s)

[target being invoked](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m53s)

[before](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m56s)

[uh generate new spec gets invoked](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h24m58s)

[because when you do a before targets MS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m02s)

[build figures out the dependency tree](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m05s)

[between all of your targets and goes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m07s)

[okay I got you and then promptly invokes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m09s)

[and so typically I would expect to see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m12s)

[mine up here. Now, you're not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m14s)

[guaranteed. Wait a minute. I am right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m15s)

[here. I am here. I am being picked up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m18s)

[Huh?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m26s)

[This guy had Why is this one not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m32s)

[Why is it grayed out?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m38s)

[Why is this one grayed out?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m46s)

[And honestly, I guess why does it need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m54s)

[to be in a target?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m56s)

[We could just bring it up here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h25m59s)

[because this is effectively doing the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m06s)

[exact same thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m08s)

[Kind of wondering if I if I care.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m15s)

[Let's Let's F5 because we just ran](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m21s)

[again. So, it is it is picking up my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m24s)

[target. I missed that. It was in there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m26s)

[Okay, so it is skipped. Why? Navigate to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m32s)

[where the target was built initially.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m37s)

[Okay, so it did run this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m40s)

[So it was skipped because it was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m44s)

[previously done. Okay, that's totally](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m45s)

[fine. Totally fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m47s)

[So the question then ishuh.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m53s)

[So let's close this out and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h26m59s)

[let me grab the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m04s)

[output one because the latest change is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m08s)

[10:25 which was 2 minutes ago but it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m10s)

[doesn't have anything in there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m13s)

[So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m17s)

[why](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m22s)

[does it not have anything in there?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m25s)

[I am confused.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m31s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m38s)

[I kind of want to look at the sets of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m46s)

[items](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m49s)

[and see why](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m51s)

[why it wasn't why it was dropped or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m54s)

[otherwise.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m57s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h27m59s)

[here we can see the add items. None that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m03s)

[have a package path put on here. I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m05s)

[just looking to see if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m08s)

[there's all of those](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m13s)

[of where they got brought in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m16s)

[Target add nougat vendor libs.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m20s)

[Where is that target?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m38s)

[Did I Am I just missing something?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m41s)

[Um, there is a target in here somewhere](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m48s)

[that I am clearly overlooking.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m51s)

[That's It's not there. It's not there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m54s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h28m58s)

[there an extra props](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m01s)

[self-contained.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m04s)

[That's not it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m08s)

[Where the heck is that target?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m11s)

[So this one here, if I doubleclick it,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m13s)

[private Velopac source directory build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m21s)

[targets.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m23s)

[Oh, look at that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m28s)

[This is adding in all the vendor stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m32s)

[Aha.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m43s)

[Package vendor libs. If it's true.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m49s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m53s)

[the Izzy just got to my coffee shop. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m56s)

[I progress thing is I think is what I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h29m57s)

[meant. I think it was something you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m01s)

[introduced me to when reviewing my media](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m03s)

[finder app. Ah, that does kind of sound](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m04s)

[like me.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m07s)

[So this is added in here. Oh, but this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m14s)

[is occurring before build because we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m16s)

[doing pack on build. Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m18s)

[got it. So what probably needs to happen](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m24s)

[is this needs to be for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m26s)

[build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m30s)

[I'm just wondering](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m37s)

[this should be fine in this order. We'll](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m40s)

[just need to test it from a clean slate](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m43s)

[because I do I do wonder the order of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m46s)

[operations here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m49s)

[right? We go through and we build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m51s)

[this. I just need to make sure.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m55s)

[Yeah, because VPK build should be done](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h30m58s)

[first. Now, if I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m01s)

[uh close](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m06s)

[and grab the latest](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m10s)

[still no bueno, still no bueno.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m16s)

[This guy here is going with build this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m28s)

[file](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m31s)

[directory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m34s)

[and then grabbing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m36s)

[I'm wondering if I if I should be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m48s)

[grabbing it from the build output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m50s)

[directory now](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m52s)

[because I think that might actually be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m54s)

[what I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h31m57s)

[I do want this. And I think I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m22s)

[uh add nougat vendor libs. Add nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m25s)

[VPK. I think this is actually what I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m29s)

[want to do here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m31s)

[And then Velpac package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m34s)

[uh VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m38s)

[this. We're going to come over to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m43s)

[I don't know. Actually, I don't think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m56s)

[this is where I want to do it. I think I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h32m58s)

[still want to do it in the project, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m00s)

[I think I want to then reach up higher.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m01s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m05s)

[because I think I want to reach higher](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m09s)

[need to go up one, two, three,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m22s)

[and then into build. So let's start with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m27s)

[two, three.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m33s)

[Build. And then we want configuration.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m35s)

[slash that's what I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m51s)

[I believe.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m56s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h33m58s)

[Try this again.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m03s)

[Now we should now we should be getting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m06s)

[useful stuff out of here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m08s)

[Now so I'm only compiling from the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m12s)

[command line so I can sele specify the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m14s)

[binary logger switch. I just find it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m17s)

[easier to do on the command line.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m19s)

[You can go through in Visual Studio and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m23s)

[specify optional command line arguments](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m24s)

[and there's something in the project](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m26s)

[properties to specify binary log as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m28s)

[well. So you can get it out that way. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m31s)

[just find it easier to do this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m33s)

[Um, we are going to hope for the best.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m36s)

[We are going to close and we are going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m39s)

[to grab this guy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m41s)

[This guy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m44s)

[Boom. Then back to here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m47s)

[Here. Oh, back.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m51s)

[Aha. Tools. Net8. There we are. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h34m56s)

[That was way too hard. Way too hard. But](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m00s)

[now we've got VPK inside of our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m04s)

[directory. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m06s)

[what that means is we should be able to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m09s)

[invoke](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m11s)

[regardless of which version of MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m13s)

[comes in, we can find VPK because it is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m16s)

[bundled alongside of everything that we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m20s)

[need.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m22s)

[Now I am wondering if I need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m25s)

[anything else.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m30s)

[because the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m34s)

[go look at because VPK I believe looks](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m36s)

[for vendor](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m40s)

[packages and so I'm I'm intentionally](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m44s)

[trying to structure this so it looks](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m46s)

[real similar I yeah so it's underneath](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m48s)

[tools net version oh but it wants net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m52s)

[any and then it wants to be inside of it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h35m55s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m00s)

[that's kind of where we're going is I is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m03s)

[I want to grab](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m06s)

[I want this to be the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m08s)

[the same idea only with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m12s)

[that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m17s)

[migra. No, I don't think it is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m21s)

[because I was I was briefly considering](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m25s)

[going through and doing the idea of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m27s)

[having the VPK changing the dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m29s)

[order have VPK take the dependenc](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m32s)

[conditionally take the dependency on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m35s)

[build and then just generate a separate](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m37s)

[NUBAT package but I think that's harder](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m39s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m42s)

[believe that's harder but I don't think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m44s)

[this matters matters.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m48s)

[I don't think that matters.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m53s)

[You just might have to check like the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m56s)

[MSI building to make sure they can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m57s)

[appropriately find Wix. I think it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h36m59s)

[actually going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m01s)

[be okay because from here it's going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m04s)

[go up one, two, and then look for a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m07s)

[vendor folder up to and over.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m10s)

[Whereas this one, it is going to go up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m15s)

[one, two, and look for a vendor folder.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m19s)

[I think it's okay in both cases. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m23s)

[it works.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m26s)

[Um, and then it should be fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m28s)

[That is the game plan. Okay, so we've](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m34s)

[got it bundled in. Now that we have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m37s)

[that, um, let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m40s)

[I think the easiest thing for me to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m43s)

[is grab one of my projects.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m45s)

[That way, we can just reference this and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m50s)

[bring it in. So, let me I don't need you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m52s)

[anymore.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m56s)

[Let me just grab this was the project I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h37m57s)

[was playing around on.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m00s)

[And let me just swap it out.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m03s)

[Um because I do also want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m10s)

[I do also want to make sure we get a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m17s)

[downstream package dependency on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m18s)

[bellow pack which right now there are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m22s)

[big heads in the way right now there are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m26s)

[no downstream dependencies and I want it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m29s)

[to have a downstream dependency on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m31s)

[Velopac because the idea is that I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m33s)

[to be be able to replace this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m36s)

[with this and just be done. That's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m39s)

[that's the game plan. And then have all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m42s)

[of the everything just work. So I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m45s)

[if I just go and add a package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m51s)

[dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m55s)

[um add project reference. And if I just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h38m57s)

[add a project reference here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m01s)

[um, I don't really want to the if I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m07s)

[the project reference, I'm going to get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m10s)

[all of the Oh, wait. No, no, I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m12s)

[have to. I don't have to. What I can do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m13s)

[is add project reference. I can do the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m16s)

[same thing that we did up there, but I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m19s)

[can do it just like this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m23s)

[Um, except for I don't want the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m27s)

[condition on this one, but I pretty much](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m29s)

[want everything else.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m32s)

[So, I want to go here and I want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m35s)

[bring this guy up. And then I want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m37s)

[bring this guy across for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m40s)

[uh project](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m44s)

[uh reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m48s)

[day. And then I want to grab this stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m50s)

[because I don't want any of this to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m54s)

[referenced, but I want it to build a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m57s)

[package that has a dependency.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h39m59s)

[Build that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m03s)

[because I want it to have a a downstream](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m05s)

[dependency on it and just pull in the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m07s)

[relevant](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m10s)

[bell pack one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m11s)

[Okay, so that got me to there. Good,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m19s)

[good, good, good, good, good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m21s)

[Close. And then this should in theory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m24s)

[didn't add the dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m30s)

[probably because it doesn't know it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m36s)

[needs it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m38s)

[I think this is wrong, but I I want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m43s)

[confirm that this that if I just package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m45s)

[reference it, it'll work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m47s)

[Um, let's let's pack there. There is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m53s)

[like in ye olden days before we had good](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h40m58s)

[packaging tooling, we used to have to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m01s)

[generate the new specs and do all kinds](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m03s)

[of wacky stuff to make the dependencies](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m05s)

[work and show up the way we wanted.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m08s)

[Nowadays, the net tooling should do it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m11s)

[for us. Yes, my package got bigger.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m14s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m19s)

[close. I think these are the same file](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m20s)

[names. If I E80,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m22s)

[it's going off the commit hash. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m25s)

[still no dependency,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m30s)

[which bothers me a great deal. I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m33s)

[have any libs in here, which is fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m36s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m43s)

[how do I get the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m48s)

[copilot?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m52s)

[I want the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m54s)

[fellow pack build nougat package to have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h41m56s)

[Yeah, do that. Make that happen.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m09s)

[Yeah, that's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m24s)

[Uh, package reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m33s)

[H](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m41s)

[no no no no no no no no stop](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m43s)

[no what I mean](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m47s)

[oh both packages are built](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m50s)

[from within this repository](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h42m55s)

[pack the bellow pack.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m03s)

[It also](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m08s)

[creates the fellow pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m10s)

[between these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m21s)

[Stop.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m28s)

[Yeah. Thanks, Copilot. You are you're a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m33s)

[real pal.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m36s)

[What we started with.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m38s)

[Okay. It went private. Oh, it went](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m43s)

[private assets. None. Oh, did I just get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m45s)

[that backwards?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m48s)

[We need to ensure the project reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m53s)

[is set up correctly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m55s)

[that might have configuration. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h43m58s)

[When private access is set to anything](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m04s)

[other than all, it will become a package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m06s)

[dependency. However, the version needs](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m08s)

[to be resolved. Let me look at how](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m10s)

[versions are managed. Nerdbank](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m12s)

[versioning blah blah blah. Great, great,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m14s)

[great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m16s)

[Me update the project reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m18s)

[correctly.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m19s)

[Uh, when you use a project reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m24s)

[with private assets not set to all.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m26s)

[Okay. So the issue was I brought in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m29s)

[private assets all then I think is the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m31s)

[answer here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m33s)

[Okay. Go copilot go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m38s)

[saved me from having to look that up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m45s)

[assuming you aren't lying to me. Oh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m46s)

[that's not helpful.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m50s)

[all in this sentence.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m55s)

[Why is that one hyperl](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h44m57s)

[and then not to anything of usefulness?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h45m00s)

[that for a moment.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m11s)

[We can look at while it's while it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m22s)

[thinking about its life um and all the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m25s)

[mistakes that it's made and why it sucks](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m28s)

[and nobody likes it. Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m30s)

[you can go through and look at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m34s)

[generate new spec](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m38s)

[because this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m41s)

[like this is what's actually building](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m48s)

[this up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m50s)

[And I am curious if we see the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m52s)

[dependencies in here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m55s)

[because this is the information that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h46m58s)

[actually passed into the task](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m00s)

[that is going to generate the Nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m04s)

[package.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m06s)

[Just looking to see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m10s)

[if there are any dependencies in here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m14s)

[uh project references with versions.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m22s)

[So, it knows there's a project reference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m26s)

[with the version,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m29s)

[which I assume would be what it does](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m33s)

[is it would leverage that to build out](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m37s)

[the dependency list. That would be my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m40s)

[theory.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m41s)

[That is a theory and one that I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m45s)

[know if it's accurate or not.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m47s)

[project re because I would assume that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m51s)

[that has](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m52s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m55s)

[what have you done copilot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h47m57s)

[converted it to a nougat package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m02s)

[development dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m13s)

[allow package dependencies Jeez](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m16s)

[keep](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m21s)

[is that is that what's doing it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m26s)

[Find out. It claims to have done a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m30s)

[thing. I'm going to build on my own so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m32s)

[that I get the binary log in case I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m34s)

[to look at it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m37s)

[and we will](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m40s)

[see if it's lying to me.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m42s)

[Okay. File recent load](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m46s)

[still no dependency. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m52s)

[the copilot. This is why no one likes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m55s)

[you is we think that you're lying to us](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h48m57s)

[because you're lying to us.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m01s)

[You you claim that you did it, but I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m04s)

[disagree](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m07s)

[mostly because I would have expected to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m11s)

[see things.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m13s)

[Um, that looks to have done](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m15s)

[the needful](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m19s)

[package files. Like it's got the list of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m24s)

[all the things to pack and where to put](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m26s)

[them. And that looks fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m28s)

[It's just the question of what which one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m32s)

[of these things generates](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m35s)

[We're going to go We're going to go on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m51s)

[little spelunking adventure. We are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m52s)

[going to go on a little spelunking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m55s)

[adventure](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m57s)

[that involves](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h49m59s)

[Wait, that's not where I want to be.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m01s)

[Um, that's where I would like to be.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m07s)

[We're just going to borrow this assembly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m11s)

[real quick and go looking at how it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m13s)

[works](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m15s)

[because I do not understand what is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m17s)

[going on. And rather than trying to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m20s)

[guess from the inputs, we are just going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m22s)

[to feed in the assembly and go take a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m25s)

[look ourselves. Okay. So the theory is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m28s)

[that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m31s)

[uh project references with versions is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m33s)

[what does it. So but for MS build task](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m35s)

[the the key thing to note here this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m40s)

[the pack task it is pointed here these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m42s)

[are the parameters passed in. So if we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m45s)

[go into this guy here task one of these](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m48s)

[things is probably going to have pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m51s)

[task. Hey look there it is.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m52s)

[Found you.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m55s)

[Okay. So when this guy executes pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h50m57s)

[commandr runner](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m00s)

[um get pack args.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m03s)

[Take a look quick look at that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m07s)

[Oh, of course it's interfaced off. Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m10s)

[you love this stuff way too much, don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m14s)

[you? Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m16s)

[where would you come from?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m23s)

[Well, maybe we just hunt the usages of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m28s)

[that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m30s)

[property. Then we assumed it was this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m32s)

[one. Copy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h51m34s)

[deedful. Okay, well that's not helpful.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m29s)

[So let's go back into our pack task on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m33s)

[our execute](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m35s)

[and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m37s)

[pack task logic is what we are hunting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m40s)

[for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m42s)

[almost assuredly here. Get pack arcs.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m44s)

[Okay, so let's start here and we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m48s)

[going to just do this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m50s)

[Uh so if it has items converts them to a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m53s)

[dictionary project versions great hashet](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h52m56s)

[populate project and package references](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m04s)

[this guy here because uh add dependency](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m07s)

[groups.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m11s)

[So that certainly sounds like what we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m13s)

[looking for. Um but it's coming from](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m15s)

[these key value pairs which is coming](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m17s)

[from this dictionary. This dictionary is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m19s)

[here. Um, initialize](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m21s)

[package dependencies here. So, what are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m25s)

[you doing? Sorry, I just realized that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m28s)

[kind of small font. Uh, let's see. Zoom](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m30s)

[I don't know. Can I type in here?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m36s)

[20. We go. There we go. That's a little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m38s)

[bigger. Uh, okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m42s)

[So, what are we doing? Uh, dependencies](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m44s)

[by framework, project ref,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m47s)

[dependencies by framework is immediately](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m51s)

[catching my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m54s)

[thought because we might need to go back](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m56s)

[look at where those come in from. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h53m59s)

[let's see. Frameworks with suppressed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m01s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m07s)

[I think I can just take this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m19s)

[um and we're going to go here context](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m24s)

[explain how the package dependencies](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m30s)

[get populated. did in this code.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m35s)

[Welcome. Uh well, right now I am on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m41s)

[mission of fertility and hating](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m45s)

[uh code, but the actual thing that we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m49s)

[are working on is Velopac. So, I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m52s)

[know if I've shown this before. Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h54m55s)

[so,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m00s)

[you can just go vellipop.io. Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m02s)

[that'll work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m04s)

[So this is a installer updater framework](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m06s)

[that I am one of the founders of.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m10s)

[It is a free and open- source one that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m13s)

[lets you build and ship uh or I should](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m18s)

[say ship and update your your uh apps](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m21s)

[fairly quickly. Um and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m24s)

[we absolutely love it. Um, and I'm right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m28s)

[now I am trying to fix a library on it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m32s)

[because we have MS build integration](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m37s)

[that I built a while back that has been](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m39s)

[broken for a little while. Um, and it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m41s)

[was broken for dumb reasons. So, working](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m44s)

[on trying to fix it so that when you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m47s)

[reference it in a project, you can just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m50s)

[type in net publish enter and be done.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m52s)

[That's the goal is build and ship](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m56s)

[updates to your application with one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h55m59s)

[command. That's that's the end result](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m00s)

[that we're looking for. Um let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m03s)

[Package spec project references maps](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m08s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m19s)

[let's see. Can I go copy sub tree? Ha.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m22s)

[Or wait.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m25s)

[sub tree or children. I don't know which](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m26s)

[one's going to give me what I want. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m27s)

[I have this in my MS build logs,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m32s)

[but no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m37s)

[is added. Why?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m42s)

[There. Figure it out. Copilot, go tell](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m48s)

[me what I what I'm missing because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m51s)

[decompiled source is hard to dig through](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m55s)

[at times. Um, nope. Not where we want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h56m57s)

[be.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m00s)

[Still not where I want to be.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m01s)

[I'm trying to see what it would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m05s)

[because ultimately we get down into this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m09s)

[for the message data.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m14s)

[is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m21s)

[what did you come up with? Uh root cause](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m24s)

[the project reference develop pack is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m26s)

[literally](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m40s)

[private assets none fine I will let you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m42s)

[have your way but you tried this a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=01h57m44s)

[so now I'm wondering if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h04m18s)

[No, it didn't have the dependency before](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h04m38s)

[see once again, co-pilot, I only mostly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h06m33s)

[that seems like I agree with you. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h06m49s)

[Let me check if there is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m14s)

[Nougat pass handles include build output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m19s)

[project has velop pack self-contained](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m24s)

[true, this is probably triggering a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m27s)

[behavior where all dependencies get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m30s)

[suppressed. Given that that's my own](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m31s)

[property, I'm going to disagree with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m34s)

[you. Copilot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m35s)

[uh is to tell the pack test to not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m37s)

[suppress dependencies for this project.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m39s)

[Now rebuild the problem is that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m43s)

[framework was being populated with all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m45s)

[suppress.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m48s)

[So effectively this is doing an items](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h07m55s)

[set of items remove that set of items.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m01s)

[So it's effectively clearing it. Did you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m04s)

[add that in already? Is that what you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m08s)

[did?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m11s)

[Suppress dispendies when packaging. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m14s)

[but try but try this approach first.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h08m18s)

[GR.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h09m48s)

[Well, let's check and see if we still](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h09m52s)

[have because the the premise may still](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h09m54s)

[hold. Does the target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h09m57s)

[still have those parameters set?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m02s)

[Uh, yeah, both of those are still there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m08s)

[Both of those are still there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m11s)

[I mean, I'm really tempted to just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m15s)

[Okay, where who is populating this?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m22s)

[Like, where does this guy get populated?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m25s)

[Add items.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m27s)

[Okay, walk each target per framework.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m30s)

[So, this guy is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m36s)

[doing an MS build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m38s)

[frameworks with suppressed dependencies](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m43s)

[projects.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m48s)

[Sure.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m51s)

[Build project reference is false. Build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m53s)

[in parallel.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m55s)

[Great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h10m57s)

[That's fine. Both of those things build,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m01s)

[but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m04s)

[like I'm I'm confused. So projects with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m05s)

[TFM no build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m11s)

[task parameter target output.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m15s)

[So these guys get invoked](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m20s)

[hitting this specialty](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m23s)

[target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m26s)

[and then those outputs make it into](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m28s)

[here. So this target got invoked inside](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m30s)

[of here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m34s)

[which is this guy here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m36s)

[suppress dependencies when. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m41s)

[this guy includes when this is true,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m45s)

[but this should have been false](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m50s)

[because we just blindly set this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h11m55s)

[press dependencies when packaging.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m00s)

[Why didn't we explicitly change that to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m03s)

[false?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m07s)

[The why.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m09s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m12s)

[Prepare to have your head hurt, which is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m14s)

[pretty much how this is going to go. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m17s)

[now I'm wishing I had popcorn.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m19s)

[Does sound really good right now. But](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m22s)

[it's it's 11:12. So 45 minutes and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m25s)

[I can make waffles because midnight](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m28s)

[waffles are the best.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m30s)

[How does this work?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m34s)

[How](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m39s)

[pizza not popcorn is that works for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m41s)

[people who are in very different time](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m44s)

[what's bothering me? So what's bothering](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h12m58s)

[me most is what I think I know about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m00s)

[MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m04s)

[is not holding true right now. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m06s)

[that's what's bothering me. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m08s)

[I'll just explain when you call net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m12s)

[build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m16s)

[what that ends up invoking it is is MS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m18s)

[build on your projects and MS build gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m20s)

[all of these targets and it goes looking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m23s)

[for a target named build and then it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m26s)

[finds all the dependencies of that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m29s)

[target and executes them in any order](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m31s)

[that satisfies the begin after](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m34s)

[constraint. Right? So it fs builds the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m36s)

[dependency graph. everyone's happy and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m38s)

[the the default SDK says that well if if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m40s)

[no explicit target is specified the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m44s)

[build target is the well-known name of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m45s)

[the one that we're going after in this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m47s)

[case this guy here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m49s)

[is calling MS build on the projects](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m53s)

[because the the magical syntax with the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h13m58s)

[at symbol here says the oh uh foot pedal](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m00s)

[there uh the at symbol is kind of like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m06s)

[an iterator to to rip around through all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m08s)

[of the projects with the TFM. And so we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m12s)

[can see which projects are passed in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m14s)

[which are both of the ones we would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m16s)

[expect](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m18s)

[projects with TFM no build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m21s)

[like is the issue that this target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m25s)

[itself is being invoked](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m26s)

[I don't think it can be walk each target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m29s)

[per framework](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m32s)

[because it invokes all of these. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m35s)

[projects with TFM.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m37s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m40s)

[Projects with with no TFM.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m41s)

[I'm a little confused as to how both of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m44s)

[these are are making it in here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m47s)

[Are these How are these populated? It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m54s)

[does just add everything to it. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m56s)

[let's see. Additional properties.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h14m59s)

[Oh, so it literally just rips through MS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m04s)

[build project full path additional](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m08s)

[properties target framework. So yeah, so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m09s)

[it's just ripping through and Okay, so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m12s)

[it's guaranteed to populate these this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m14s)

[way because I'm targeting two](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m17s)

[frameworks. Great. Fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m18s)

[So it builds those up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m22s)

[invokes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m24s)

[build output in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m27s)

[what are these other ones outputting?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m31s)

[target outputs. Yeah, build outputs and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m38s)

[package. Okay, so it's building all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m41s)

[these up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m43s)

[Those are all fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m46s)

[Like there's the package files,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m50s)

[right? Like it's it's figuring all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m53s)

[this stuff out by looking at the output.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h15m55s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m02s)

[I'm with you so far.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m03s)

[Frameworks with suppressed dependencies.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m09s)

[This target here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m22s)

[get frameworks with suppressed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m27s)

[dependencies. The press dependencies](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m29s)

[when packaging it is checking for true](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m32s)

[and so it has to be equal to true. But](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m35s)

[the only way that makes sense is if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m38s)

[something else set it before us.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m41s)

[But like this is a top level entry](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m45s)

[point.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m47s)

[Like entry targets.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m50s)

[This is the entry point. Like who set](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m53s)

[that to true?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h16m55s)

[like that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h17m00s)

[No, no, no. That's I I want it without](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h17m04s)

[Okay, so one of you guys is changing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h17m11s)

[this value.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h17m13s)

[This is going to true.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h17m20s)

[If it's just my build project, I'm gonna](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m22s)

[be a little annoyed at past Kevin.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m24s)

[It is literally just my build project.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m28s)

[So, if I turn that off,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m33s)

[um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m44s)

[that should in theory Oh my word. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m49s)

[I've been stymied myself by what Past](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m52s)

[Kevin did. Why did Past Kevin do that?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h18m54s)

[Past Kevin probably did that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m02s)

[because before we were referencing the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m05s)

[other DLS and bringing them in directly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m08s)

[and now](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m12s)

[and and that would avoid those](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m14s)

[That's probably why](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m20s)

[I did that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m24s)

[Hallelujah. There we go. That's what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h19m27s)

[I don't actually want the build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h20m04s)

[not all.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h20m12s)

[Velopac references. Hallelujah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h22m48s)

[Uh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m04s)

[yeah, that's not going to work. We do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m05s)

[not want a lib folder. Anything in the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m07s)

[so we want to not have, which is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m21s)

[probably why we had this in here in the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m25s)

[I think that's what I want is that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h23m40s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m05s)

[Show given that now we go back to here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m08s)

[what I would like to do. So, this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m11s)

[just a little app that I was building](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m14s)

[for automatically typing because I had a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m17s)

[particular project I was on that made me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m22s)

[sign into a particularly obnoxious VM](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m24s)

[where you had to have a long complicated](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m27s)

[password, but they banned the ability to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m29s)

[copy and paste from password manager,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m32s)

[which annoyed me. And so, what did I do?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m34s)

[I wrote a little app that can read off](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m38s)

[my clipboard and type in the characters](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m40s)

[that it sees. Was that potentially the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m42s)

[hardest solution I could come up with?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m45s)

[Yes. Does it work? Also, yes. So, that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m47s)

[net global tool is out there. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m51s)

[there's a little guey application as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m52s)

[well because reasons. Um because I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m54s)

[needed a guey application here. I can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h25m58s)

[show it real quick. It's a very simple](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m00s)

[one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m02s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m07s)

[Uh where did it go? What monitor is it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m09s)

[on? There it is. Okay. So, for example,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m12s)

[uh let's see. Charles 8, which AI are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m16s)

[you using? So, I am currently favoring](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m20s)

[GitHub Copilot though. Uh the backing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m22s)

[model that I like at the moment is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m27s)

[Claude Sonnet 45. So at least for fornet](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m30s)

[related stuff I I feel like I get the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m35s)

[best results out of the the cloud](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m38s)

[models.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m40s)

[Um but I do bounce between like GitHub](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m42s)

[copilot isn't just a single product.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m45s)

[Like even though it's all under the same](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m47s)

[name, they are different kind of client](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m50s)

[applications when it comes to how you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m52s)

[interact with it. So like the one in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m54s)

[Visual Studio has slightly different](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m56s)

[tools available to it than the one in VS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h26m58s)

[Code for example. Uh but anyway, it it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m00s)

[a very simple thing. Like for example,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m03s)

[if I click this, I've got one second to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m05s)

[come over here, click into my uh little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m08s)

[chat box, and poof, it typed it in and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m11s)

[pressed enter for me. Auzzah, right? So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m13s)

[it it kind of cool. Or like if you want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m18s)

[to do uh something like this where it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m20s)

[does a big long co-pilot command, right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m23s)

[It just types out all of this. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m25s)

[spoiler, if you want to know what I use](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m29s)

[this for, go to Gitcon.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m31s)

[I should probably I should probably plug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m34s)

[that again. People who haven't seen it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m35s)

[lot of builder deviated stuff. And more](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m47s)

[importantly, this session here, not that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m49s)

[I'm biased, is going to be completely](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m52s)

[awesome.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m54s)

[Hypothetically speaking, um I have the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h27m56s)

[and the content will be awesome.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m03s)

[So if you are interested,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m06s)

[but it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m10s)

[my favorite uh conferences.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m14s)

[Anyway, so this thing is using Velopac](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m17s)

[to push out the releases because if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m20s)

[people want to play with it, there is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m23s)

[act like I'm actually hosting it out on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m25s)

[my Velopac stuff. Um, but what I would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m27s)

[like to do is I would like to change my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m31s)

[Nougat config so that I've got a package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m35s)

[that is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m39s)

[uh we're going to call it maybe local.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m42s)

[And then we're gonna go, oh, I guess I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m46s)

[gotta do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m49s)

[uh a add key](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m50s)

[local](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m56s)

[this folder is.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h28m59s)

[Plug you in there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m05s)

[local to pick up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m09s)

[Oh, I put this outside the wrong thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m14s)

[It goes like that. Yeah, goes like this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m16s)

[And I want all of the packac.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m19s)

[Oh, you have to spell it correctly.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m24s)

[Nougat packages to resolve from my local](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m25s)

[source instead of nougat.org. Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m27s)

[great. Show if we go here and look at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m29s)

[our Nougat sources. I guess you got to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m33s)

[stop debugging for this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m36s)

[Let's see. Chia says, "I give Sonet 45](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m39s)

[full auto approval rights and tell it to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m41s)

[use as many tokens as possible to make](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m43s)

[something. It'll poop out a working](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m44s)

[application nine out of 10 times." Yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m46s)

[I I I give it a fairly high degree of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m48s)

[permissions. I don't have it full yolo](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m51s)

[mode, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m54s)

[like a good chunk of my MCPs I just give](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m55s)

[it rights to rock and roll on,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h29m58s)

[especially if they're MCPs that I that I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m01s)

[trust to to do things. Um, it does crank](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m03s)

[things out. The one thing that I have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m06s)

[been bitten by is it'll work. It'll jump](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m08s)

[out a working application, but if I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m11s)

[don't clean up the code, I end up with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m13s)

[slowly worsening code bases. And so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m15s)

[there's always there's always cleanup to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m18s)

[go after it. But yeah, it does work](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m20s)

[shockingly well. Okay. So, if I go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m23s)

[pre-release and I want to be on my local](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m25s)

[and if we browse my local source,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m30s)

[let the chaos begin. Let the chaos](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m35s)

[begin. Okay. So what I would like to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m38s)

[is I would like to add the build package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m41s)

[to that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m43s)

[because the goal here is I want to test](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m52s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m54s)

[Um so we are going to drop this out of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m56s)

[here because in theory the build package](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h30m58s)

[should be a drop in replacement. my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m01s)

[packages.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m03s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m06s)

[I'm gonna just put these both to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m08s)

[same version for the moment, even though](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m10s)

[one of them's on nougat.org and one of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m12s)

[them's local. Um, because until I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m14s)

[publish this, it's not like I can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m17s)

[realistically use that. Okay, so step](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m19s)

[one, do it build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m22s)

[because the downstream dependency should](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m24s)

[guarantee that it just works.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h31m27s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m14s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m17s)

[Detected project down. I don't have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m19s)

[anything else that has a transitive](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m21s)

[dependency. Do I? I don't think I do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m23s)

[Nothing else in here. Like this is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m26s)

[very small app.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m27s)

[I'm confused as to where this is coming](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m30s)

[from. Autotyper UI build has So the way](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m33s)

[to read these errors is it's giving you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m38s)

[the path through each of these. Oh um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m41s)

[but I didn't remove I did remove that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m45s)

[about to say I didn't remove the pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m50s)

[reference from here. What's confusing me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m52s)

[is this is claiming that autotyper UI](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m54s)

[references Velopac build and Velopac and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m57s)

[that they are at different versions. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h32m59s)

[have a strange feeling this is lying to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m02s)

[me](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m04s)

[um because it is not actually there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m06s)

[and even the output window confirms](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m13s)

[that. I think it I may end up just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m15s)

[having to restart Visual Studio. There](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m18s)

[is a occasionally some caching that can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m19s)

[bite you with packages when you change](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m22s)

[package sources. Yeah, I'm going to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m24s)

[with Visual Studio is not always hip to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m27s)

[certain file changes. So, I'm going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m30s)

[just relaunch](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m32s)

[and check and see because that's the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m34s)

[path of least resistance first of all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m35s)

[because the air doesn't make sense. It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m39s)

[seems to indicate a reference that is no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m41s)

[longer there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m43s)

[And that's fine for this local test. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m45s)

[don't I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m47s)

[Uh, let's see. Izzy, off-topic question.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m54s)

[Are you a line manager and have to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m56s)

[performance reviews of your team? If so,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h33m57s)

[how would you tell a team member they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m00s)

[need to start remembering a thing and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m03s)

[need less handholding through](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m05s)

[everything? Oh.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m07s)

[Uh, so let's see here. Um, am I a line](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m11s)

[manager? That's question one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m15s)

[kind of kind of so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m21s)

[the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m27s)

[the where I work it's not quite set up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m29s)

[that exact way. So they have they they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m32s)

[don't call them managers and and this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m36s)

[somewhat unique to where I work. I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m38s)

[think this is common in the industry. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m39s)

[just to be clear, this is a little more](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m41s)

[off off base is every person at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m43s)

[company has somebody who set as their](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m46s)

[mentor, which is not quite a manager. Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m48s)

[the mentors do do uh something close to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m53s)

[a performance review. Um the difference](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h34m58s)

[being is that the review from your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m01s)

[mentor is not like necessarily tied](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m02s)

[directly to compensation or similar.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m06s)

[it's more about trying to help people](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m08s)

[improve. Um whereas](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m10s)

[there is also](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m14s)

[team leads](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m16s)

[um which can sometimes be the person](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m18s)

[who's either basically running point for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m21s)

[a project or it could be the person](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m24s)

[who's running point for the client](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m26s)

[itself. Um just because of the nature of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m28s)

[where we work sometimes there's only](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m30s)

[like one or two people for a client and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m33s)

[so it it doesn't really make a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m35s)

[sense in all cases. Um, and so depending](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m37s)

[on how it's going, you might receive](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m40s)

[that kind of critical feedback from](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m43s)

[either of those two sources. Um, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m45s)

[depending on how you look at it, I there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m50s)

[are several people at the company where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m52s)

[I am their mentor and there are some](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m54s)

[people where on teams where I am running](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h35m57s)

[lead on it, but the te teams where I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m00s)

[running lead, I'm only the technical](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m03s)

[lead. I'm not like the client manager or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m05s)

[similar. So just level set of where I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m07s)

[coming from. So I will do technical](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m10s)

[reviews and oftentimes those come](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m12s)

[more in PR form or direct meeting type](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m15s)

[situation.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m18s)

[Um see I'm a line manager for people who](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m19s)

[I don't work with. The idea being they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m22s)

[can moan to me about people in their](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m25s)

[project teams but I also have to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m27s)

[awkward PDR meets. Ah](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m29s)

[well Sid, thank you for the follow.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m33s)

[appreciate it. Yeah. No, that makes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m35s)

[sense, Izzy. It it is I think that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m36s)

[probably more in line with what my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m38s)

[company refers to as the mentor because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m41s)

[the mentors may or may not be people](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m43s)

[that you directly work with um on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m46s)

[day-to-day basis. They could be people](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m49s)

[on completely different teams or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m51s)

[otherwise. Um so, in fact,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m52s)

[sorry, running through my list real](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m57s)

[quick. none of my mentees are on my team](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h36m59s)

[or on any of my teams right now. Um, and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m02s)

[so it is a little bit more akin to that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m06s)

[I think to to go back to your original](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m09s)

[question of of how would you tell the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m11s)

[team member they need to start](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m13s)

[remembering a thing and need less](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m14s)

[handholding or similar. Um, I oftentimes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m16s)

[and so I abhore conflict. I really don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m20s)

[like it. And so sometimes I am not as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m25s)

[firm as I probably should be because I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m28s)

[I'm bad at it. And that is an area that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m30s)

[I know I am not great at.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m32s)

[Um I often times try to take the lead a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m35s)

[horse to water um to to try to get them](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m39s)

[to drink rather than trying to just say](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m43s)

[you need to drink more water. So for a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m45s)

[team member that maybe is need needs](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m48s)

[some um encouragement to need less](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m51s)

[handholding oftentimes I would put it to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m54s)

[them in the form of trying to understand](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m56s)

[why why they're asking questions so much](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h37m59s)

[because oftentimes handholding at least](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m02s)

[where I'm at comes in the form of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m05s)

[they're immediately jumping at and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m07s)

[asking questions. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m09s)

[trying to push them to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m12s)

[solve things as much or or try to put](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m14s)

[some guidelines around, hey before you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m17s)

[before you ask questions, honestly get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m19s)

[them a rubber duck. Um have you have you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m22s)

[told your problem to the duck? Have you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m26s)

[like try to start putting some uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m29s)

[algorithms I guess in front of them?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m33s)

[Like if they're an engineer oftentimes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m34s)

[that thing goes well. Ask Google. Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m36s)

[a handful of things of have you done X Y](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m39s)

[and Z before you go to the before you go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m42s)

[to the question because that that can go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m45s)

[one of two ways like I've done things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m48s)

[where you tell the team member hey you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m50s)

[know you you need to we we really would](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m53s)

[like to see you try to to work this out](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m55s)

[on your own before you come and ask](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m57s)

[questions but there also may end up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h38m58s)

[needing to be training that has to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m01s)

[with that because what I've seen quite](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m04s)

[often is once the team member realizes,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m07s)

["Oh, I need to look stuff up before](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m09s)

[going and asking questions." Sometimes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m12s)

[they come up with very creative](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m14s)

[solutions that aren't quite what people](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m16s)

[were expecting or wanting. So, sometimes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m19s)

[they're asking questions because they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m23s)

[need training and don't know what to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m24s)

[But I think if they at least get to that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m26s)

[point where they are then ask they are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m29s)

[then trying to do that investigation](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m31s)

[themsel then the conversation can pivot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m32s)

[to okay let's let's now at least work on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m35s)

[your solution so that you can see how to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m39s)

[move there and it slowly starts to train](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m41s)

[them up on what the correct solution](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m43s)

[could look like. This does all assume](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m45s)

[that the person is a receptive to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m47s)

[feedback and b wants to get better](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m50s)

[because that's something I've never](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m52s)

[figured out how to solve is an engineer](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m54s)

[who doesn't want to get better. Like I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m57s)

[can't train away apathy. That just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h39m59s)

[doesn't like I can't do that. Um that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m01s)

[an HR problem for when we were hiring.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m05s)

[We try not to hire people like that. We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m07s)

[want people that a take feedback and b](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m09s)

[want to learn and get better because if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m12s)

[they at least have that mindset, I can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m14s)

[like the technical side can be solved](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m16s)

[eventually. That's not usually a big](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m18s)

[issue. I can't solve attitude. That's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m20s)

[that's a hard problem to solve with just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m22s)

[straight training. So, I don't know. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m25s)

[hope that helps a little bit. Maybe](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m28s)

[it it is one of those areas where I have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m32s)

[been playing around with trying to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m34s)

[figure out how to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m37s)

[um better mentoring for people. Um yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m39s)

[if they don't want to improve, then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m44s)

[maybe they should try something else](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m45s)

[somewhere else. Yes. Correct. Correct.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m47s)

[At that point, I think that that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m50s)

[usually because that's only happened to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m53s)

[me twice in my career where I've run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m55s)

[where I've run a muck of this where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m56s)

[I feel like I'm out of to the tools I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h40m59s)

[have are insufficient at that point and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m02s)

[I usually have to punt and call in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m05s)

[somebody else to help because it's like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m08s)

[I I don't know like I I can teach them](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m10s)

[technical but if they aren't interested](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m12s)

[in learning like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m14s)

[I don't know what to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m16s)

[and now I'm confused. So yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m19s)

[the one of the hiring rubrics that we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m23s)

[like to use at our company is based upon](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m26s)

[they they call it the three A's mostly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m29s)

[we had two A's and then we had to make](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m31s)

[the third word work. So um attitude um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m32s)

[what is it? Attitude, ability and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m36s)

[aptitude, right? And so attitude uh or I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m38s)

[should say ability is obvious. It's what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m43s)

[somebody can do. Um, aptitude is how](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m44s)

[quickly they learn, how quickly they can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m47s)

[increase their ability. Um, and attitude](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m49s)

[is how much friction there's going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m52s)

[along the way. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h41m54s)

[I think I have to do I think I have to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m16s)

[do something of that nature.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m18s)

[start doing this in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m31s)

[last let's try come on arrange act is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m35s)

[what my mind jumped to with triple A.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m39s)

[Yeah that is that is correct and based](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m40s)

[on the fact that we had a bunch of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m43s)

[engineers in the room when we were](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m45s)

[coming up with that um you you are not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m46s)

[the only one whose brain went that way.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m49s)

[though. Sometimes those nice happy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m53s)

[accidents just they work out well. It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m56s)

[makes it easy to remember. Though I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h43m59s)

[always have to do exactly like that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m01s)

[where I have to go back and kind of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m02s)

[mentally jump through the hoops of what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m04s)

[are each of the A's. Um why are we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m06s)

[failing to find](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m10s)

[pre-release on the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m26s)

[think I do browse?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m29s)

[There you found it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m41s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m44s)

[just check the air here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m47s)

[170. Yep, that's kind of what we want. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m53s)

[mean, we can pull this in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h44m58s)

[directly and see what if that helps it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m00s)

[resolve better. I do the the pre-release](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m03s)

[dependency versions. Oh, did I pick up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m07s)

[an extra one?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m10s)

[Oh, this guy has Nougat versioning.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m20s)

[I think that's expected because we rely](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m25s)

[on Nougat versioning for because Velopac](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m28s)

[uses Nougat packages as its container.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m32s)

[Okay. So, we'll save that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m38s)

[Now, are you happier?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m41s)

[Like, you know where the package is and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m44s)

[you know where to find it. Okay. You](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m46s)

[just needed to be told. Okay. Okay. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m49s)

[the good news is this guy compiles,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m53s)

[works properly.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m55s)

[Now, what we would like to do now that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h45m57s)

[we've got this rocking and rolling](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m00s)

[is we need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m03s)

[I'm going to open up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m06s)

[So there's there's multiple ways to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m10s)

[about doing this, but when you restore a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m12s)

[Nougat package, it caches it inside of a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m14s)

[local folder, typically user](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m17s)

[directory.Nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m19s)

[or packages. And the problem being is e](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m21s)

[when I publish new ones because they're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m24s)

[the same version, Nougat doesn't care.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m27s)

[It assumes packages are immutable. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m29s)

[so it won't redownload a version that it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m32s)

[already has in its cache, even if that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m35s)

[version is from a local source. Right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m37s)

[So when we publish updates, we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m40s)

[to have to just torch that sucker. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m42s)

[okay. So now what we would like to do is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m45s)

[actually implement this thing and see it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m48s)

[work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m49s)

[Okay. Now we build. Now we build. So the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m52s)

[pack task.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m56s)

[So for for those who want to play along](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h46m58s)

[at home, um this is on the getting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m01s)

[started direction, we are effectively](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m06s)

[going to be doing this this line down](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m08s)

[here, right? VPK pack ID your pack ID](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m11s)

[version packtor publisher output maniac,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m16s)

[right? This is this is what we want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m18s)

[automate away such that when you do a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m21s)

[net publish, it automatically runs this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m23s)

[VPK pack. That's the end goal.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m25s)

[Right. It's only taking me, you know,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m28s)

[two hours to get here. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m32s)

[okay. So, on our pack task, we have this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m36s)

[tool runner. We want to build the pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m38s)

[args up. And most of these are going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m41s)

[come in from here. And I think we have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m43s)

[everything referenced. So I just want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m50s)

[check here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m52s)

[because on our pack task we have all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m55s)

[this stuff, right? These are effectively](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h47m57s)

[all of the options for VPK pack,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m00s)

[which is fine. Great. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m04s)

[since we have all of those,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m09s)

[um, we should be able to come in here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m12s)

[and I'm going to circle back to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m15s)

[build arguments because that's going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m17s)

[be what we end up needing next. This](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m19s)

[thing's taking an array, which I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m21s)

[is what we're going to want. But we need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m24s)

[to get this thing into here. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m26s)

[what we need to do here is find the VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m30s)

[executable.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m35s)

[Uh, so we're just going to go with uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m37s)

[private string.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m40s)

[Uh, find or actually, you know what?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m42s)

[We're going to do this find VPK,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m44s)

[right? because we are going to come in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m49s)

[here and we should know our current](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m50s)

[location.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m53s)

[If we don't, we can certainly get it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h48m56s)

[We can certainly get our our current](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m00s)

[running location. And I was just looking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m04s)

[to see if we have anything that we are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m06s)

[passing in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m08s)

[because we want to resolve from where](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m11s)

[this file is being loaded from,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m17s)

[not based upon our working directory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m21s)

[because our working directory is going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m23s)

[to be likely the the project directory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m25s)

[of the project that's referencing it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m28s)

[Whereas this targets file is going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m31s)

[live inside of the nougat. And if we do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m33s)

[it from inside of the nougat, we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m35s)

[then just go the up directory, right? We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m38s)

[can do the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m41s)

[uh because if we resolve from our our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m44s)

[targets file, we can just go up a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m46s)

[directory gets us to the root and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m48s)

[down a directory. I guess I can close](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m50s)

[and reload this. Um, I wonder if I need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m53s)

[to close.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m56s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h49m58s)

[cuz we can just go up a directory,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m01s)

[tools, net 8, and then we're off to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m03s)

[races. And that I think gets us all the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m05s)

[way there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m07s)

[Yeah. And I think we're going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m14s)

[reliant on.net.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m17s)

[I'm just trying to decide if that's the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m19s)

[way we actually want to do it. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m21s)

[it is I because I think we don't want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m24s)

[rely on the .exe itself. I think we want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m28s)

[to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m30s)

[net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m32s)

[um and pull it in which means we need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m34s)

[our current directory passed into us.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m38s)

[Um let me look and just make sure that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m42s)

[we don't have it already passed in. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m45s)

[think these are all pack ones.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m46s)

[So we aren't um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m49s)

[strongly typed TFM.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h50m56s)

[We're grabbing our DLL,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m01s)

[which is fine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m05s)

[to be able to get our task.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m08s)

[I guess we could grab it from the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m11s)

[assembly location, couldn't we? because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m13s)

[the assembly location will get us all](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m15s)

[the way in as well.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m18s)

[Wait a minute. I just noticed we don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m23s)

[have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m25s)

[we aren't packing our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m30s)

[Uh that's not going to work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m37s)

[Ah, suck.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m40s)

[I'm willing to bet that lovely little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m42s)

[self-contained thing is to blame. Again,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m43s)

[it was probably doing a great job of it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m47s)

[Kind of like this thing here might have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m50s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m54s)

[because this is pulling in the Look at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m57s)

[that. Okay. So, we're just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h51m59s)

[bring this guy in here. We're just gonna](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m00s)

[I think we're going to go here. We're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m05s)

[going to turn that off](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m07s)

[and that off.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m10s)

[And then we're going to grab that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m12s)

[self-contained target because this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m14s)

[just ripping through all of our target](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m16s)

[Um, and just dumping those in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m25s)

[I think this is what we'll want. Bring](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m30s)

[it down here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m33s)

[Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m36s)

[then let's build this over.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m38s)

[I might have to rebuild,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m44s)

[but it might pick it up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m49s)

[It might pick it up. It looks like it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m51s)

[it's taking long enough that I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m52s)

[it's actually rebuilding.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h52m54s)

[Think I can just click here and have it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m00s)

[rather than doing the close and reopen.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m02s)

[Think I think I think I think. Come on.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m05s)

[Build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m08s)

[There's a progress bar.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m11s)

[Not all code pads return a value. Of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m16s)

[course they don't. I haven't called it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m18s)

[yet.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m19s)

[Get it. You're unhappy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m21s)

[No one likes you. I I understand. Just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m24s)

[build.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m27s)

[Just want all my stuff in a right happy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m30s)

[place.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m32s)

[The actual implementation is not going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m35s)

[to be that hard. It's just going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m36s)

[invoke VPK.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m38s)

[Okay. So, right here, recent files.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m41s)

[There.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m44s)

[There we go. Okay. So, now we've got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m46s)

[Okay, this is what we're looking for.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m48s)

[Oh, it did include way more than I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m53s)

[wanted again. Okay, that is a problem](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m54s)

[for a different day,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h53m57s)

[but we will deal with that later. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m03s)

[think I just want to make sure that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m06s)

[develop build stuff is here. So, we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m09s)

[go from our DLL](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m11s)

[up one two directories and then down](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m13s)

[into tools and then into net 8. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m16s)

[we are going to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m21s)

[oh one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m24s)

[two directories down into tools down](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m26s)

[into net 8.0](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m29s)

[uh slash uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m33s)

[bpk I believe gets us into what we want.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m37s)

[EPK DLL I think is what we want to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m43s)

[for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m46s)

[because we cann net run on that. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m48s)

[string bpk path and we're going to go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m52s)

[with path get full path.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h54m56s)

[I don't want to do path get full path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m03s)

[because that is not going to be correct](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m06s)

[because this is based upon your working](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m11s)

[directory.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m13s)

[All right, we're going to return uh VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m15s)

[path. Uh let's see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m18s)

[if file exists](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m21s)

[false.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m25s)

[No, you're doing so good.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m26s)

[You want to help there?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m30s)

[Okay. So, we'll do that for now.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m34s)

[Um, but I need to get my current running](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m40s)

[directory. So, we can do assembly](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m43s)

[get executing assembly, which is the one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m47s)

[that you're in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m50s)

[Then we need to do a path combine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h55m58s)

[this with this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m02s)

[And actually, I suppose I should](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m05s)

[probably](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m07s)

[not do each of these as](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m10s)

[slashes. We'll just do this just just to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m15s)

[be better about our platform agnostic. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m18s)

[realize Windows will happily handle the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m22s)

[forward slashes and that should handle](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m24s)

[all our Nyx platforms, but we're going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m25s)

[to do this. We're already using path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m27s)

[combine. We might as well do this. Uh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m30s)

[let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m32s)

[String pk path path get full path. This](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m34s)

[should give us a fully qualified path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m41s)

[that is rooted in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m43s)

[the nougat package. Uh, let's see. Isn't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m47s)

[there a relative path thing where you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m49s)

[can pass the the projectctor to get what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m51s)

[you need? Yes, sort of. So, MS build](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m53s)

[does have that concept where you could](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h56m57s)

[um where you can leverage like there's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m00s)

[these MS build this file uh current](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m02s)

[project a handful of those things. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m06s)

[problem is is because we are a nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m09s)

[package, not the project being invoked.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m11s)

[Um the working directory is likely going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m15s)

[to be the project or solution directory.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m18s)

[We don't have control over that. And we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m21s)

[are going to be running inside of an](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m23s)

[extracted directory structure that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m26s)

[matches this Nougat path, but it's going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m29s)

[to be inside of wherever the user's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m33s)

[Nougat uh package cache is located. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m36s)

[we kind of have to relative pathy our](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m40s)

[way around and we can't rely on a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m42s)

[the MS build built-in variables because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m44s)

[most of those are targeting like the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m47s)

[current project, current output, those](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m49s)

[types of things. But what we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m51s)

[leverage is the this file directory. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m53s)

[I could pass this into myself if I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m56s)

[wanted it, but because I'm already using](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h57m58s)

[it to look up the DL, I can just use my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m01s)

[own DL to walk my way back out and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m04s)

[around.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m07s)

[Um, and I could](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m08s)

[No, I I can't because I can't use](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m13s)

[relative paths inside of the code](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m15s)

[because things like path get full uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m19s)

[path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m22s)

[are going to end up um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m24s)

[if you feed a relative path to get full](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m28s)

[path, it resolves it based upon your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m30s)

[current working directory. This is one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m33s)

[of those gotchas that a lot of people](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m34s)

[get bit by when building console](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m36s)

[applications because they always assume](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m39s)

[that their executables directory is the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m41s)

[working directory. It's like, well,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m44s)

[that's not always the case. Um, and so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m45s)

[double-checking where you think you are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m49s)

[is usually a good idea. I think we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m51s)

[going to go here first.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m55s)

[And and I'm fine with the throw because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h58m58s)

[in this case we are going to be like if](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m00s)

[this tool isn't here something has gone](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m04s)

[wrong with either our packaging or the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m06s)

[nougat extraction like we like we got we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m08s)

[got issues.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m11s)

[Um, okay. So, down here when we run tool](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m13s)

[run VPK, I think what we're going to end](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m18s)

[up doing isnet](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m20s)

[and then this guy here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m24s)

[um, doesn't I I I vaguely recall this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m27s)

[thing having an argument list, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m30s)

[there's ver I I can't remember which](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m33s)

[versions of.net had that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m36s)

[There there is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m40s)

[it is just arguments.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m43s)

[Yuck](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m47s)

[yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck yuck.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m50s)

[I think if I change myself because I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m53s)

[think net 8 actually has arguments list.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m55s)

[Yeah, see this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=02h59m59s)

[see not available in net 472 but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m03s)

[available in net 8. Ah grumble grumble](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m06s)

[grumble grumble grumble. Um, and this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m08s)

[why in our main](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m10s)

[library we have that util](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m13s)

[because we wanted the ability to be able](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m16s)

[to do this kind of thing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m19s)

[Um, I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m23s)

[yeah, because this is uh so apparently](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m27s)

[net five or greater has argument list](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m29s)

[versus the other one that does append](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m32s)

[arguments.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m35s)

[I think it's down here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m37s)

[and does all kinds of extra stuffs.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m40s)

[Uh let's see here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m44s)

[Invoked here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m47s)

[That's invoked there. And where else is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m50s)

[it invoked?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m52s)

[Why does this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h00m57s)

[Oh, it just outputs it for the debug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m04s)

[string. I was like, wow. Izzy, have a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m06s)

[good one at work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m08s)

[Uh yeah, and prep for an awkward](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m11s)

[performance review meetings. See you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m13s)

[next week.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m15s)

[Okay, that's why those things are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m19s)

[available in both because we invoke them](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m20s)

[on both sides.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m23s)

[I'm really tempted to include this in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m26s)

[because I think I want these utilities.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m30s)

[In fact, I think I can just access them](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m34s)

[now that I have a package reference.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m38s)

[I think I can because I can just do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m43s)

[using vevelopacutil,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m45s)

[right? Isn't that under util or is it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m48s)

[not?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m50s)

[Oh, but this is an internal class](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m53s)

[and I can't make it public.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h01m57s)

[I don't really want to expose it to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m01s)

[callers.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m02s)

[But what I can do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m06s)

[is I can split the file](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m08s)

[and then file include the portion that I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m11s)

[want. Uh process](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m14s)

[extensions](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m18s)

[uh shared CS. We can do this. So we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m20s)

[we can get away with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m24s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m28s)

[oh we don't have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m30s)

[selfupdate.net or update link version.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m33s)

[Um not my not my not my issue right at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m36s)

[the second. We'll get to there in a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m40s)

[minute. Internal static](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m41s)

[partial class.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m45s)

[Okay. And now what we can do is we can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m47s)

[just move over everything that I want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m50s)

[into the shared half of the equation.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m52s)

[So you go over here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h02m57s)

[cuz I want you. And then I need the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m00s)

[Oh, I need to make you static](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m06s)

[and I need to put partial in the right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m10s)

[place. Partial must always precede](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m12s)

[class.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m14s)

[And then I need to grab the relevant](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m16s)

[methods down below](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m19s)

[because I want all I don't want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m23s)

[recreate all of this stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m24s)

[I need I think I need all of this. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m27s)

[remember right. Not I'll know in a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m30s)

[second.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m32s)

[And that all goes there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m34s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m39s)

[The using save that. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m43s)

[Now what I can do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m47s)

[clean up the using there is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m50s)

[I can file link in the shared one. So I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m54s)

[can go with existing item](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h03m58s)

[and I can reach up and I can go across](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m01s)

[into the main Velopac library and say I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m04s)

[would like that file please. I'm just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m08s)

[going to grab the shared one.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m12s)

[add file link.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m15s)

[Boom.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m18s)

[Um, that one wants me to go to file](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m23s)

[scope namespaces, but that will be bad.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m25s)

[But now I can do this append arguments](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m29s)

[list safe and just append in all of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m31s)

[arguments and I don't have to worry](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m34s)

[about the escaping or similar, which I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m36s)

[think will make my life much easier.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m39s)

[We go pack task down here. Oh, no. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m43s)

[want to look at the run tool.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m47s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m50s)

[run VPK. So, we're going to pull out the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m53s)

[process start info real quick.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m55s)

[We're going to go here. Go here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h04m59s)

[We're going to go uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m03s)

[put that there. Start](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m09s)

[info. Stop it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m13s)

[Quit helping me. I will make you happy](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m16s)

[in a moment. Just be patient.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m18s)

[Okay, there we go. So, we go like that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m21s)

[Then I think I want to pull you out. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m25s)

[then I want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m27s)

[uh start info](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m29s)

[add arguments list safe, which is what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m32s)

[we the whole reason for bringing that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m35s)

[in. And then arguments.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m36s)

[I want to make an I innumerable of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m40s)

[string.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m42s)

[And I don't care about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m44s)

[the extra variable. So, but I do need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m47s)

[you to be I innumerable of string.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m50s)

[It goes like that. That goes like that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m54s)

[And then this becomes info goes like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m56s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h05m59s)

[Your problem.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m01s)

[Okay. And then you become](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m05s)

[a new string.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m10s)

[Uh, let's see here. I don't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m18s)

[don't really care about most of this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m23s)

[stuff at the moment because I have a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m24s)

[feeling we're about to just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m27s)

[make you public. Then I think we're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m31s)

[going to just kill off](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m33s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m36s)

[I don't know that we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m41s)

[are going to expose a capture output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m44s)

[variable. I think we're just going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m46s)

[hardcode that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m48s)

[Um because I think we are going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m51s)

[do that for now. Where is this captured](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h06m58s)

[output going?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m00s)

[Uh, let's see here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m13s)

[We don't care about this bool at all.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m15s)

[I do think that I'm probably double](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m20s)

[logging here because I'm both throwing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m23s)

[it into the string builder and calling](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m26s)

[the logger log warning. So it this may](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m28s)

[be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m31s)

[problematic.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m33s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m39s)

[yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m42s)

[it's probably better like that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m45s)

[And then we probably just need to prefix](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m53s)

[arguments into here because I think what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m55s)

[I'm going to want is because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h07m58s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m02s)

[I think I need to and VPK](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m09s)

[and then I need to spread arguments](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m13s)

[into there I think is what we want.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m18s)

[Um, I don't think we need this to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m21s)

[anymore. That goes away and doesn't need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m24s)

[to exist.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m26s)

[And then that goes there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m28s)

[Oh, and this is where we want to plug in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m34s)

[our VPK.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m35s)

[We want it there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m39s)

[Okay, so that will run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m42s)

[all of that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m46s)

[I think what I actually want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m50s)

[though up here is because we've got](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m51s)

[multiple things using the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m54s)

[arguments](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h08m58s)

[um collection down below for outputs. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m00s)

[think I want to actually do this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m03s)

[concatenation up here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m05s)

[that way.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m10s)

[Done once.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m13s)

[Oh, this is an interesting one. I wonder](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m17s)

[what this does on multiple enumerations.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m20s)

[This is an interesting the I think this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m27s)

[is a bug way I've implemented it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m29s)

[Let's test real quick. I I want to write](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m35s)

[a test to see if if that is in fact a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m37s)

[bug. show what I mean here in a moment.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m39s)

[Let's go here. We're just going to write](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m42s)

[a quick test.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m43s)

[Uh public void test enumeration, right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m45s)

[So here's here's the setup, right? So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m50s)

[private void I innumerable or but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m52s)

[private void well private string stuff,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h09m55s)

[right? And it's going to take in an](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m00s)

[innumerable of strings](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m01s)

[uh items, right? And we're going to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m04s)

[something like items gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m06s)

[uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m09s)

[one comma spread](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m11s)

[uh items,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m16s)

[right?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m18s)

[And then we're going to do something](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m19s)

[like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m21s)

[um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m22s)

[console write line](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m25s)

[string join](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m28s)

[comma separated](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m31s)

[of items](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m33s)

[and then I want to do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m35s)

[effectively the same thing but I want to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m38s)

[do space separated](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m40s)

[right and the question is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m43s)

[uh we can make this void now In fact, we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m46s)

[can just move this right inside the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m49s)

[test. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m50s)

[see my innumerable string items 2 3 4](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h10m57s)

[right. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m02s)

[I don't know what this is going to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m06s)

[And I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m09s)

[uh let's let's uh string first let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m12s)

[rather than console writing it let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m16s)

[just hash it in a variable](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m18s)

[string](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m21s)

[first two because that's that's how you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m23s)

[really poorly name a variable. Um so the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m25s)

[idea with innumerabs is there's deferred](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m29s)

[execution. And so when you grab an](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m31s)

[innumerable, it moves itself to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m33s)

[beginning and just calls move next, move](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m36s)

[next, move next to get the next item.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m37s)

[I'm curious if the innumerable is going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m41s)

[to reset](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m43s)

[and if it resets, how it evaluates this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m45s)

[collection expression. So are these the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m48s)

[same value?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m51s)

[This is one, two, three, 4.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m54s)

[This is one, two, three, four. Okay, so](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h11m58s)

[it doesn't actually I wasn't sure how](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m01s)

[that collection expression was going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m04s)

[re-evaluate.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m05s)

[Okay, so we're fine. Not an issue. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m08s)

[wasn't sure whether I was going to see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m11s)

[it a second time. My my internal](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m12s)

[compiler just could not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m13s)

[grock where that was going to happen.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m16s)

[Okay, we're fine there because my my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m19s)

[fear was that this arguments was was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m21s)

[going to get iterated once here and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m23s)

[uh again further down when it does](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m25s)

[things like this, right? Uh, and this is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m28s)

[actually wrong.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m31s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m35s)

[this should probably just be a string](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m39s)

[join of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m41s)

[bases](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m44s)

[here because that arguments is going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m46s)

[be wrong.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m50s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m53s)

[wants a string. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h12m55s)

[There we go.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m00s)

[That builds that up. That calls netvpk](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m03s)

[runvpk. We go to our pack task. This is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m06s)

[going to call runvpk. We shouldn't need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m09s)

[this anymore. We just have the args.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m13s)

[We're off to the races. Uh before it was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m15s)

[getting an exit code, so we should](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m18s)

[actually return the exit code down](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m20s)

[below.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m22s)

[Um so we're going to grab](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m24s)

[change this to an int.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m30s)

[And then we are going to grab](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m34s)

[process.exit](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m38s)

[code. We're going to get rid of this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m40s)

[return.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m42s)

[That gets us to there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m46s)

[And I think that gets us rolling. I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m50s)

[think we just have to fix the one on the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m51s)

[other side. Yeah. So, this is going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m54s)

[be run VPK. Don't care about you right](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h13m56s)

[now.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m00s)

[And that should just work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m02s)

[Okay. Compile yourself up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m05s)

[Then I think we're going to try to debug](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m17s)

[this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m20s)

[Uh, let's see.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m22s)

[Test test.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m25s)

[Um, what is your problem?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m31s)

[Why do you not think the build framework](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m35s)

[is referenced anymore?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m37s)

[Oh, because these guys are dropped](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m51s)

[because we went private assets so they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m57s)

[don't get exposed so the test project](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h14m59s)

[doesn't know about it. Okay. So, we need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m01s)

[to come up here and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m04s)

[I think that is a legitimate.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m19s)

[Okay, I think that one's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m28s)

[Build framework](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m34s)

[there. So that's okay. So it just needed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h15m37s)

[No.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h16m37s)

[Am I the only one who doesn't see it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h16m42s)

[You're a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h16m53s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h16m55s)

[sorry. Still practicing with my foot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h16m57s)

[pedal. Foot pedals are hard.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m00s)

[I'll say my son was very confused.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m07s)

[They've been taking music lessons and I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m09s)

[built these foot pedals from actual like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m12s)

[musical keyboard foot pedals like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m14s)

[many many years ago. Ironically](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m19s)

[purchasing these pedals from the same](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m21s)

[place where my kids are now taking music](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m23s)

[lessons. So they saw them and they're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m25s)

[like, "Oh, I know what those are." I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m27s)

[like, "No, you don't. No, no, no you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m29s)

[don't. Let me assure you, you don't.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m31s)

[I have gutted them and repurposed them.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m34s)

[They are they are no longer serving](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m36s)

[their original purpose.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m39s)

[Why do we have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m42s)

[Okay, these are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m45s)

[not necessary](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m48s)

[like No.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h17m55s)

[Do you actually have foot pedals?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m00s)

[Yes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m03s)

[Foot pedal. It's my control key](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m07s)

[because my pin key is hard.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m11s)

[Having to reach all the way down to that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m16s)

[thing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m18s)

[and I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m20s)

[I built I I I put it in a box.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m23s)

[Very ingenious. It was one of the very](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m29s)

[first soldering projects I ever did.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m31s)

[Um, what do the pedals do? It just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m36s)

[presses the control key. That's that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m38s)

[literally it. When the pedal goes down,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m40s)

[it's the same as pressing the control](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m42s)

[key on a keyboard. Uh, and I know that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m44s)

[because I I literally soldered the the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m46s)

[ends of the switch on the foot pedal to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m50s)

[the little microcontroller on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m52s)

[keyboard's uh uh little pins because I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m54s)

[went through it one day with just a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h18m58s)

[little wire touching the pins and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m00s)

[mapping out which sets of pins went to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m02s)

[which key uh which keyboard keys. Like I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m04s)

[wrote a little app that just displayed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m08s)

[which keyboard key was being pressed,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m10s)

[which sounds worthless until you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m12s)

[trying to do something like this. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m14s)

[and then I literally just took my little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m17s)

[wire and mapped out which pins went](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m19s)

[where because it's kind of like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m21s)

[battleship, right? Like you just like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m22s)

[give one set of pins a letter and the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m26s)

[other set a number. It's like B4. Okay,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m27s)

[B4 is mapped to the A key. Okay, great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m30s)

[And then with that, you can](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m33s)

[solder those switches on. Newer](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m36s)

[keyboards is harder to do because the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m38s)

[circuitry has gotten so tiny, like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m39s)

[there's no like metal pins to solder on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m41s)

[in a lot of cases. But I did this on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m44s)

[keyboard that was very old and very](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m46s)

[easy. And the nice part, keyboards](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m48s)

[haven't changed that much. Like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m51s)

[it's remarkably simple to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m55s)

[Okay, this should build now, I think.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h19m59s)

[Yes. So, you just you get a little foot](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m02s)

[pedal. And I've been practicing with it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m04s)

[because I technically also have a shift](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m09s)

[one as well, but the switch on the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m11s)

[inside of it has gone out. And so I need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m13s)

[to tear into it and fix it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m16s)

[because I've I I literally have got like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m22s)

[I I bought actual uh musical keyboard](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m25s)

[foot pedals because they're very](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m29s)

[simplistic in in the design. like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m31s)

[they're just they're just a switch and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m33s)

[like the back side of it. It's just a a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m40s)

[quarter inch audio cable, which is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m43s)

[effectively a simple two- wire system.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m45s)

[And so all I did was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m48s)

[take those two wires and hook them up to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m51s)

[the appropriate pins on the keyboard's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m53s)

[microcontroller and poof.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h20m55s)

[Then when you press the pedal,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m00s)

[you make it work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m02s)

[It's amazing how much you can do with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m05s)

[just a two simple wire system. Um I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m07s)

[not understand why you have lost your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m11s)

[mind here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m13s)

[That's something I do for a game. I just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m15s)

[have a foot fell for for a specific](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m18s)

[ability or something. Yeah. Well, and I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m19s)

[I have a um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m21s)

[I I don't have it sitting next to me at](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m25s)

[the moment, but I can pull it up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m26s)

[like I No, not this thing. So, Logitech](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m30s)

[made this device a long time ago and I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m34s)

[have one of these things and I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m38s)

[absolutely love it. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m40s)

[these things. Uh, that's a horrible](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m43s)

[picture. Let me find me a better](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m47s)

[high-res image.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m49s)

[Uh, yeah, like one of these. There, that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m51s)

[looks like it. Um, but it's just a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m54s)

[programmable keyboard. Like this is part](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m56s)

[of why I've never bothered to get like a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h21m59s)

[a Stream Deck because a Stream Deck is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m01s)

[programmable keyboard where the buttons](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m05s)

[are are fancy little lights. Like I I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m07s)

[know they have extra software and stuff](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m10s)

[that does things, but at the end of the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m11s)

[day, that's what the hardware is. It's a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m12s)

[programmable keyboard where the buttons](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m14s)

[are cool little LED screens. Like that's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m16s)

[it. And I've got this, which is a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m18s)

[completely programmable keyboard.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m21s)

[So, I usually just program this sucker](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m26s)

[up with different modes for when](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m28s)

[streaming and then wire that into my OBS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m29s)

[to to change scenes and whatnot. Um, and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m31s)

[the only disadvantage is, you know, the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m34s)

[buttons don't have the the cool little](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m36s)

[pictures. So, they are very difficult to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m39s)

[find anymore, but I swear this thing is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m42s)

[bloody bulletproof. It has had water](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m45s)

[spilled on it. It has been dropped. It](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m47s)

[has been thrown. It survived multiple](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m49s)

[moves. I don't think like this thing was](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m51s)

[built to last. The big disadvantage is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m54s)

[Logitech has stopped producing newer uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m56s)

[drivers for it. So, at some point I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h22m59s)

[going to get hosed. Um you can still](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m01s)

[force the old software for it to run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m04s)

[under Windows 11, but it's it's showing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m06s)

[signs of them wanting to kill it off.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m09s)

[And like I've looked at because Razer](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m11s)

[makes something kind of similar, but](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m13s)

[it's just it's not quite the same.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m15s)

[Um, yeah, I use my numpad for my stream](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m18s)

[deck. Yeah, see that would that works](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m21s)

[perfectly well. Um, at at my office, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m24s)

[actually have a little programmable N](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m28s)

[key that I bought off of Amazon. it.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m30s)

[It's nothing fancy, but I just bound the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m32s)

[because it's uh a programmable thing, I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m37s)

[just bound the the number keys to the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m39s)

[upper function buttons, and I use that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m41s)

[as well to to then uh wire up different](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m44s)

[functions to those. Like all my OBS](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m48s)

[stuff is bound to like F13 through F um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m50s)

[I think it's F13 through F16 or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m54s)

[something like that. And so it it just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m56s)

[waits until it find until it sees one of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h23m59s)

[those and goes, "Oh, okay. I know what](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m01s)

[you mean." And we're off to the races.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m03s)

[Um I am kind of questioning if I need](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m06s)

[any of these tests](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m08s)

[because these are reflection tests. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m11s)

[we're going to just the solution here is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m12s)

[we're just going to burn this entire I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m15s)

[don't know if any of these tests are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m18s)

[valuable.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m19s)

[Problem solved.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m21s)

[But yeah, the I I love my Logitech](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m23s)

[board. I absolutely love it. They they](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m27s)

[make very quality stuff.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m30s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m34s)

[so I've I've often used them. Though I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m36s)

[will say for my my typing keyboard, um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m39s)

[for a long time I had a Logitech](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m42s)

[keyboard, but then a a colleague of mine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m44s)

[showed me his mechanical clacky keyboard](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m46s)

[and then unfortunately I tried it and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m50s)

[and now I have a mechanical clacky](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m52s)

[keyboard for typing because it it just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m54s)

[works.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h24m56s)

[Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m00s)

[Um, I am getting annoyed with this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m02s)

[project completely since there's nothing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m05s)

[in it. So, we're just going to unload it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m07s)

[and the problem's going to go away.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m08s)

[Project can't have errors if it's not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m11s)

[loaded.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m12s)

[Uh, could not copy because it was not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m15s)

[found.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m18s)

[That is a lie.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m21s)

[Rebuild. Figure yourself out.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m25s)

[Figure yourself out.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m29s)

[So, I have been looking at a couple](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m31s)

[different alternatives because uh like I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m33s)

[Logitech thing of eventually me not](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m37s)

[being able to run the old software to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m39s)

[support it or the drivers causing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m42s)

[problems and similar. So, at some point](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m43s)

[I am going to need to replace it. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m46s)

[I've been looking at different](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m47s)

[programmable ones. I want to get um I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m49s)

[don't remember what it's called. When](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m54s)

[you have the little spinny dial button](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m55s)

[um rather than just the this um the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h25m58s)

[stream deck with the programmable](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m01s)

[buttons, I want something with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m02s)

[programmable buttons and a dial. I've](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m04s)

[got a couple cases where I actually want](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m06s)

[to be able to like turn things up or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m08s)

[down. Like I've got my audio on a a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m09s)

[physical dial that I can turn.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m13s)

[Why are you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m16s)

[Why are you now having trouble? Could](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m18s)

[not copy because it was not found.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m21s)

[Visual Studio, you are slowly hinting to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m25s)

[me that it is bedtime.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m29s)

[I I think that's what it's what it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m31s)

[coming to.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m33s)

[But I really want to see this thing just](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m35s)

[run once. That's all I want to see is it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m37s)

[run once. Is it that much to ask?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m39s)

[Shouldn't be that much.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m44s)

[Spinny dial.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m49s)

[Yes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m51s)

[Like these spinny dial. I want to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h26m57s)

[able to turn the dials.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m00s)

[That's my audio board or that's my my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m06s)

[controller that I plug all of my audio](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m08s)

[in. I am weird.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m10s)

[It it actually took me a while to find a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m13s)

[board that does this because that has](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m14s)

[four inputs and one output](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m16s)

[and so I can plug four different devices](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m19s)

[in and each one of those devices I have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m22s)

[an individual volume control feeding](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m25s)

[into my set of headphones. I have a bad](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m27s)

[habit of like joining calls, having](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m30s)

[music running, and like talking to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m34s)

[different like being able to have all of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m38s)

[my things on their own volume dial is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m40s)

[love it. I don't think I've ever used](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m43s)

[more than three at a time, though. Four](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m45s)

[is overkill. And I and most of the time](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m47s)

[I could get away with just two because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m50s)

[most of the time I'm only running two](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m51s)

[separate inputs. Like if I get to a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m53s)

[third, it's usually because I'm running](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m55s)

[music and then I'm on two calls at the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m57s)

[same time. And so being able to dial](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h27m58s)

[those things up and down. Don't be on](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m01s)

[two calls at the same time. It's It is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m03s)

[It is not recommended. Makes my head](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m06s)

[hurt. But sometimes I want to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m09s)

[listening to two calls at the same time.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m10s)

[It's very handy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m14s)

[Like hypothetically,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m19s)

[um maybe maybe you want to be listening](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m21s)

[to Gitcon and then it's your team](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m23s)

[standup,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m25s)

[but you don't want to miss anything for](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m27s)

[Gitcon, so you leave that going and then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m28s)

[join standup anyway,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m31s)

[hypothetically speaking. Not that anyone](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m34s)

[would plan to do that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m38s)

[You've got all the bells and whistles.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m40s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m42s)

[not really. But I do I do I do like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m44s)

[having knobs and dials. What is going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m47s)

[on? Why are you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m50s)

[could not copy because it doesn't exist.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m53s)

[What? What? What is something has fallen](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h28m57s)

[over and I don't know what and I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m00s)

[unhappy about it. Okay.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m03s)

[What have I done?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m06s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m09s)

[That's fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m11s)

[That's a delete. We're okay with that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m13s)

[That's just code going away. We're fine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m18s)

[with that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m20s)

[We're fine with that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m23s)

[Yeah. Hypothetically. Yes.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m28s)

[Hypothetically. I I I do get made fun of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m29s)

[a lot by certain team members who think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m33s)

[that I'm weird for doing that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m36s)

[and they don't understand how I can do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m39s)

[it. I like I started doing the dual](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m41s)

[audio thing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m44s)

[many years ago with uh I want to tune](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m46s)

[in. Um yes, I am speaking at Gitcon.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m50s)

[Important one. So day one, if you scroll](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m55s)

[down,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h29m58s)

[this is the session you want to go to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m00s)

[going to be awesome.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m04s)

[So yes, I will be there day one. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m10s)

[like I started doing it many years ago](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m16s)

[with audiobooks and I usually joke with](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m18s)

[people that the moment you can do Pride](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m20s)

[and Prejudice while while being on a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m23s)

[stand-up call and interacting like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m26s)

[that's when you know you've done it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m28s)

[because I did that at one point](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m30s)

[and like I got through a lot of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m34s)

[audiobooks when I never had to pause](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m36s)

[them because there was an incoming call.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m37s)

[You just turn the volume a little bit](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m40s)

[and that's why I need the volume](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m42s)

[controls.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m43s)

[So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m45s)

[yes, so yes, get con it will be awesome](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m47s)

[and more importantly you also get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m51s)

[entered into like a drawing for a switch](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m52s)

[which is which is pretty cool.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h30m56s)

[Um, okay. So the tool runner I think is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m00s)

[fine.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m03s)

[Did I do something in the directory?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m05s)

[build targets a new line. That's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m07s)

[irrelevant. We'll just delete that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m10s)

[Um, okay. And then the test](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m13s)

[like what happened that this stopped](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m20s)

[building](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m22s)

[was the file link](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m23s)

[build test. Like this thing is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m29s)

[technically](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m32s)

[there but it's unloaded.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m34s)

[Yeah. So there's um what is it called?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m41s)

[There is a website for audio books that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m45s)

[are in the public domain.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m48s)

[Um](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m51s)

[yeah,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m53s)

[this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m55s)

[um and so it is it is basically uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h31m57s)

[volunteer readers and so the obviously](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m01s)

[everything that you're going to get is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m04s)

[going to be older things that have that](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m05s)

[are old enough to fall into the public](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m08s)

[domain. Um, and some of the readers are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m10s)

[amazing, some of them are less amazing,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m12s)

[but it does give you uh a catalog. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m16s)

[so I for a while I was doing a bunch of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m21s)

[old classics](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m24s)

[because they were readily available. And](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m26s)

[as long as I could find a reader that I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m29s)

[could tolerate listening to their voice,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m32s)

[that was good enough for me. Though I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m34s)

[will say this, if you use it, check to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m36s)

[make sure the reader finishes the whole](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m38s)

[book because oftentimes they record like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m40s)

[either chapters or sections. And there](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m42s)

[was a number of times I got bit because](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m44s)

[I started listening to a reader](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m46s)

[thinking, "Oh, this is great." And then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m47s)

[didn't realize that they hadn't finished](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m49s)

[the whole book and that was frustrating](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m51s)

[to me. So](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m53s)

[don't so just just check. It's worth](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m56s)

[checking.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h32m59s)

[But it is a it was a great source of](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m01s)

[audiobooks.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m03s)

[Okay. So that I I just do not understand](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m08s)

[why I'm getting bit and I'm feeling like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m11s)

[I this is like a full net clean rebuild](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m13s)

[situation here in a minute because it's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m16s)

[it's building the Nougat packet like](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m18s)

[it's doing all the things](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m20s)

[because did it execute a clean? No, it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m26s)

[just executed rebuild.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m28s)

[Uh](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m32s)

[oh, Libby, I do have a library card.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m35s)

[I do](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m40s)

[punch that in.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m45s)

[Well, interesting.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m52s)

[I do like their](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h33m57s)

[Guess](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m00s)

[find your nearest library using your](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m02s)

[probable approximate location. Haha.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m03s)

[Yeah, you're going to try to geollocate](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m05s)

[my IP. Good luck. Um.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m07s)

[Uh.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m11s)

[Yes. Yes. No. My wife has it even worse.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m16s)

[Like she she oftentimes the the book](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m19s)

[series or similar that she gets wrapped](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m22s)

[up in are often the ones that didn't get](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m23s)

[finished. Like Yeah. Don't do that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m25s)

[like I'm sorry I can't do anything about](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m29s)

[that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m32s)

[Uh, okay. So, now we built just fine](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m33s)

[after restarting and cleaning and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m35s)

[rebuilding. So, huzzah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m37s)

[Okay. All of this whack this test. We](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m40s)

[don't need you anymore.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m43s)

[Now, I do want to rebuild this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m45s)

[and I should see the Nougat package show](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m48s)

[up here.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m51s)

[of course. Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h34m54s)

[why do you keep defaulting back to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m00s)

[nougat.org?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m02s)

[It's like you don't know what I'm](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m06s)

[telling you to do.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m08s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m11s)

[well, let's just go back. Do the thing](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m13s)

[that we did before. Come in here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m15s)

[and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m20s)

[uninstall.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m24s)

[Apply.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m25s)

[Install.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m28s)

[I know this is really hard for you,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m31s)

[Visual Studio, but I do not understand](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m32s)

[why you keep picking the wrong source.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m34s)

[Feels like something I'm going to have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m38s)

[to do. Okay, look at that. Shockingly,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m39s)

[uninstalling and reinstalling the exact](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m43s)

[same package.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m45s)

[I wonder if it's because it's then in](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m47s)

[the cache and so it dodges the problem.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m49s)

[Wonder if that's it. That wouldn't](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m52s)

[surprise me. Okay. Um because when you](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m54s)

[do have multiple So it shouldn't be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h35m58s)

[landing on multiple sources. Or maybe it](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m00s)

[is.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m02s)

[Maybe it is landing on multiple sources](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m05s)

[because my nougat.org is a star](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m07s)

[because when there's multiple sources,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m11s)

[it's whichever one responds first gets](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m13s)

[to win, which is a fun thing to realize](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m15s)

[when you're doing supply chain](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m18s)

[injection.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m20s)

[Uh, okay. So, if I go here and I go here](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m22s)

[and I go C autotyper.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m28s)

[Yeah. And I go into here and I go](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m32s)

[autotyper ui the project we just added](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m35s)

[this to. And I go net publish. Enter.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m38s)

[This is what we would like to have work.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m43s)

[We would like this thing to publish and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m47s)

[I would like it to build me a pack](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m49s)

[release. And the good news is it worked.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m52s)

[Well, let me rephrase. The good news is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m56s)

[it ran our code. The bad news is it fell](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h36m58s)

[over and died with the file not found](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m02s)

[exception because it couldn't find](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m04s)

[in VPK build tool runner. So that no](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m10s)

[bueno that no bueno. Um and the way we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m14s)

[debug this is kind of hacky.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m18s)

[Um we come down here we do something](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m22s)

[horrendous. We go debugger](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m25s)

[launch.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m32s)

[That goes there.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m35s)

[We're going to rebuild this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m37s)

[It worked dish. Yeah, it we failed](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m41s)

[successfully or unfailed unsuccess.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m44s)

[Yeah. Um I can't do boolean logic in my](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m49s)

[head right now. So that's that's the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m52s)

[other problem](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m54s)

[which is also an issue when you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m55s)

[trying to be a a developer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h37m57s)

[important prer.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m02s)

[This is something I also would not trust](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m07s)

[a co-pilot with.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m08s)

[Copilot would botch this. I am very](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m11s)

[convinced of it. or at least it would be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m13s)

[difficult to give C-Pilot enough](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m15s)

[permissions and access across my system](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m18s)

[to do this setup. Okay, so that goes](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m20s)

[like that. We come here, we come here,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m24s)

[we do a rebuild,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m28s)

[we see if it picks up. Yeah, it once](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m30s)

[again has lost its mind. I wonder can I](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m32s)

[ban](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m37s)

[wonder if I could just turn this off](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m40s)

[since the rest of them are cached](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m42s)

[so that it only can land on the one](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m46s)

[Oh, that still doesn't make it happy.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m52s)

[Okay, we're just going to go in here and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m54s)

[manage project references or](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h38m56s)

[manage nougat packages. That's user](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m00s)

[Good news, there's no secrets in this](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m06s)

[repository. That would have been](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m08s)

[embarrassing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m10s)

[Um,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m11s)

[we are going to uninstall.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m13s)

[Yeah.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m17s)

[We're going to reinstall.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m23s)

[Come on, figure it out.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m30s)

[You can do it. I believe in you. Is](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m32s)

[okay. And then we are going to come down](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m36s)

[here and we are going to net publish and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m38s)

[it is going to throw an exception](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m42s)

[that looks like this. And then we are](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m46s)

[going to attach to the running net](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m48s)

[publish process](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m51s)

[with a debugger over here. And now we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m54s)

[are good to go. So, we are going to step](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h39m58s)

[into here, do this, do this. I guess we](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m00s)

[didn't actually build up the arg. So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m03s)

[that's that's also kind of going to be](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m05s)

[an issue, too. Um, but what we really](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m08s)

[want to do is go in and look at this.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m11s)

[So, VPK path](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m13s)

[is a I think that's actually pretty](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m17s)

[close, isn't it?](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m20s)

[Looks like what I would expect.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m24s)

[Something is not right though. Let's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m28s)

[see. I've got this thing open.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m30s)

[So, let's see. C users uh keto K Nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m33s)

[great.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m46s)

[Oh,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m48s)

[I need to go up one more directory](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m50s)

[because I need to be I should not see](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m54s)

[build in here. I should be going](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m57s)

[straight to tools is the problem. That's](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h40m58s)

[the issue. I need one more dot dowack.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m01s)

[That's the problem.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m09s)

[That is the problem.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m11s)

[Okay. So, we are going to once again](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m14s)

[rebuild](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m16s)

[And while that thing thinks about its](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m17s)

[life, I am going to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m19s)

[I close the directory.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m22s)

[Embarrassing.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m25s)

[Good news. Got it right here. Um, go up](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m27s)

[one more. I'm going to whack that.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m30s)

[Once that builds, we are apparently](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m34s)

[going to come in here and manage nougat](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m37s)

[packages](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m39s)

[just to uh uninstall and reinstall.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m41s)

[Yeah, I don't dou I don't doubt you're](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m43s)

[unhappy. There's probably errors. The](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m44s)

[locked.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m50s)

[You don't get to touch it right now.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m53s)

[I really just want to see this thing run](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m56s)

[once successfully and then I can go to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h41m58s)

[bed. Oh man, it's 12:40 almost getting](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m00s)

[close to 1.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m05s)

[There's the VPK depths problem. I think](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m08s)

[that's my signal. That is my signal.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m10s)

[Okay, go here. Hey, Kraken. Write me a](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m13s)

[commit message. I'm way too lazy to](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m17s)

[think.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m18s)

[It is way too late for me to be thinking](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m21s)

[about what this needs to look like.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m22s)

[I'll send it. And then](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m36s)

[I'll continue to hack on it more and](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m39s)

[then we will see where that ends up.](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m41s)

[So,](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m45s)

[since my brain cannot comprehend the](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m47s)

[dependency things and what I have](https://youtu.be/IyQpS0TYdxk?t=03h42m55s)
